65371         $FF5B          CINT
Initialize Screen Editor and VIC-II Chip

This is a documented Kernal routine whose entry in the jump table is
located at 65409 ($FF81).

The start of the routine appears to be a patch that was added to later
versions of the Kernal.  It first calls the old routine at 58648
($E518).  This initializes the VIC-II chip to the default values, sets
the keyboard as the input device and the screen as the output device,
initializes the cursor flash variables, builds the screen line link
table, clears the screen, and homes the cursor.  The new code then
checks the VIC Interrupt register to see if the conditions for a
Raster Compare IRQ have been fulfilled.  Since the Raster Register was
initialized to 311, that can only occur when using a PAL system (NTSC
screens do not have that many scan lines).  The PAL/NTSC register at
678 ($2A6) is set on the basis of the outcome of this test.  The CIA
#1 Timer A is then set to cause an IRQ interrupt every sixtieth of a
second, using the prescaler figures for a PAL or NTSC system, as
appropriate.

65390         $FF6E
End of Routine to Set Timer for Sixtieth of a Second IRQ

This appears to be a patch added to compensate for the extra length of
the current version of this routine, which chooses either the PAL or
NTSC prescaler values for the timer.

65408         $FF80
Kernal Version Identifier Byte

This last byte before the jump table can be used to identify the
version of the Kernal.  The first version has a 170 ($AA) stored here,
while the most current version at the time of this writing has a zero
in this location.

The PET 64, a one-piece version with an integrated monochrome display,
has an identifier byte of 100 ($64).  The Commodore 64 logo uses this
byte to recognize the PET 64, and adjust its display accordingly.

Location Range: 65409-65525 ($FF81-$FFF5)
Kernal Jump Table

The following jump table is provided by Commodore in an effort to
maintain stable entry points for key I/O routines.  Each three-byte
table entry consists of a 6510 JMP instruction and the actual address
of the routine in the ROM.  Although the actual address of the routine
may vary from machine to machine, or in later versions of the Kernal,
these addresses will stay where they are.  By jumping to the entry
point provided by this table, rather than directly into the ROM, you
insure your programs against changes in the Operating System.  In
addition, this jump table may help you write programs that will
function on more than one Commodore machine.  The 15 table entries
from 65472-65514 ($FFC0-$FFEA) are the same for all Commodore
machines, from the earliest PET on.

As an additional aid, some of these routines are also vectored through
the table which starts at 788 ($314).  Since this table is in RAM, you
can change those vectors to point to your own routines which support
additional I/O devices.  Programs that use the jump table entry points
to the I/O routines will be able to use these I/O devices without a
problem.

The following table will give the entry point, routine name, RAM
vector if any, its current address, and a brief summary of its
function.

6510 Hardware Vectors

The last six locations in memory are reserved by the 6510 processor
chip for three fixed vectors.  These vectors let the chip know at what
address to start executing machine language program code when an NMI
interrupt occurs, when the computer is turned on, or when an IRQ
interrupt or BRK occurs.

65530         $FFFA
Non-Maskable Interrupt Hardware Vector

This vector points to the main NMI routine at 65091 ($FE43).

65532         $FFFC
System Reset (RES) Hardware Vector

This vector points to the power-on routine at 64738 ($FCE2).

65534         $FFFE
Maskable Interrupt Request and Break Hardware Vectors

This vector points to the main IRQ handler routine at 65352 ($FF48).
