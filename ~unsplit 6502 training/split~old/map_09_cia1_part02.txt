Timers A and B Low and High Bytes

These four timer registers (two for each timer) have different
functions depending on whether you are reading from them or writing to
them.  When you read from these registers, you get the present value
of the Timer Counter (which counts down from its initial value to 0).
When you write data to these registers, it is stored in the Timer
Latch, and from there it can be used to load the Timer Counter using
the Force Load bit of Control Register A or B (see 56334-5 ($DC0E-F)
below).

These interval timers can hold a 16-bit number from 0 to 65535, in
normal 6510 low-byte, high-byte format (VALUE=LOW BYTE+256*HIGH BYTE).
Once the Timer Counter is set to an initial value, and the timer is
started, the timer will count down one number every microprocessor
clock cycle.  Since the clock speed of the 64 (using the American NTSC
television standard) is 1,022,730 cycles per second, every count takes
approximately a millionth of a second.  The formula for calculating
the amount of time it will take for the timer to count down from its
latch value to 0 is:

TIME=LATCH VALUE/CLOCK SPEED

where LATCH VALUE is the value written to the low and high timer
registers (LATCH VALUE=TIMER LOW+256*TIMER HIGH), and CLOCK SPEED is
1,022,370 cycles per second for American (NTSC) standard television
monitors, or 985,250 for European (PAL) monitors.

When Timer Counter A or B gets to 0, it will set Bit 0 or 1 in the
Interrupt Control Register at 56333 ($DC0D).  If the timer interrupt
has been enabled (see 56333 ($DC0D)), an IRQ will take place, and the
high bit of the Interrupt Control Register will be set to 1.
Alternately, if the Port B output bit is set, the timer will write
data to Bit 6 or 7 of Port B.  After the timer gets to 0, it will
reload the Timer Latch Value, and either stop or count down again,
depending on whether it is in one-shot or continuous mode (determined
by Bit 3 of the Control Register).

Although usually a timer will be used to count the microprocessor
cycles, Timer A can count either the microprocessor clock cycles or
external pulses on the CTN line, which is connected to pin 4 of the
User Port.

Timer B is even more versatile.  In addition to these two sources,
Timer B can count the number of times that Timer A goes to 0.  By
setting Timer A to count the microprocessor clock, and setting Timer B
to count the number of times that Timer A zeros, you effectively link
the two timers into one 32-bit timer that can count up to 70 minutes
with accuracy within 1/15 second.

In the 64, CIA #1 Timer A is used to generate the interrupt which
drives the routine for reading the keyboard and updating the software
clock.  Both Timers A and B are also used for the timing of the
routines that read and write tape data.  Normally, Timer A is set for
continuous operation, and latched with a value of 149 in the low byte
and 66 in the high byte, for a total Latch Value of 17045.  This means
that it is set to count to 0 every 17045/1022730 seconds, or
approximately 1/60 second.

For tape reads and writes, the tape routines take over the IRQ
vectors.  Even though the tape write routines use the on-chip I/O port
at location 1 for the actual data output to the cassette, reading and
writing to the cassette uses both CIA #1 Timer A and Timer B for
timing the I/O routines.

Time of Day Clock (TOD)

In addition to the two general-purpose timers, the 6526 CIA chip has a
special-purpose Time of Day Clock, which keeps time in a format that
humans can understand a little more easily than microseconds.

This Time of Day Clock even has an alarm, which can cause an interrupt
at a specific time.  It is organized in four registers, one each for
hours, minutes, seconds, and tenths of seconds.  Each register reads
out in Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) format, for easier conversion to
ASCII digits.  A BCD byte is divided into two nybbles, each of which
represents a single digit in base 10.  Even though a four-bit nybble
can hold a number from 0 to 15, only the base 10 digits of 0-9 are
used.  Therefore, 10 0'clock would be represented by a byte in the
hours register with the nybbles 0001 and 0000, which stand for the
digits 1 and 0.  The binary value of this byte would be 16 (16 times
the high nybble plus the low nybble).  Each of the other registers
operates in the same manner.  In addition, Bit 7 of the hours register
is used as an AM/PM flag.  If that bit is set to 1, it indicates PM,
and if it is set to 0, the time is AM.

The Time of Day Clock Registers can be used for two purposes,
depending on whether you are reading them or writing to them.  If you
are reading them, you will always be reading the time.  There is a
latching feature associated with reading the hours register in order
to solve the problem of the time changing while you are reading the
registers.  For example, if you were reading the hours register just
as the time was changing from 10:59 to 11:00, it is possible that you
would read the 10 in the hours register, and by the time you read the
minutes register it would have changed from 59 to 00.  Therefore, you
would read 10:00 instead of either 10:59 or 11:00.

To prevent this kind of mistake, the Time of Day Clock Registers stop
updating as soon as you read the hours register, and do not start
again until you read the tenths of seconds register.  Of course, the
clock continues to keep time internally even though it does not update
the registers.  If you want to read only minutes, or seconds or tenths
of seconds, there is no problem, and no latching will occur.  But
anytime you read hours, you must follow it by reading tenths of
seconds, even if you don't care about them, or else the registers will
not continue to update.

Writing to these registers either sets the time or the alarm,
depending on the setting of Bit 7 of Control Register B (56335,
$DC0F).  If that bit is set to 1, writing to the Time of Day registers
sets the alarm.  If the bit is set to 0, writing to the Time of Day
registers sets the Time of Day clock.  In either case, as with reading
the registers, there is a latch function.  This function stops the
clock from updating when you write to the hours register.  The clock
will not start again until you write to the tenths of seconds
registers.

The only apparent use of the Time of Day Clock by the 64's Operating
System is in the BASIC RND statement.  There, the seconds and tenths
of seconds registers are read and their values used as part of the
seed value for the RND(0) command.

Nonetheless, this clock can be an invaluable resource for the 64 user.
It will keep time more accurately than the software clock maintained
at locations 60-162 ($A0-$A2) by the Timer A interrupt routine.  And
unlike that software clock, the Time of Day Clock will not be
disturbed when I/O operations disrupt the Timer A IRQ, or when the IRQ
vector is diverted elsewhere.  Not even a cold start RESET will
disrupt the time.  For game timers, just set the time for 00:00:00:0
and it will keep track of elapsed time in hours, minutes, seconds and
tenths of seconds format.

The following digital clock program, written in BASIC, will
demonstrate the use of these timers:

Serial Data Port

The CIA chip has an on-chip serial port, which allows you to send or
receive a byte of data one bit at a time, with the most significant
bit (Bit 7) being transferred first.  Control Register A at 56334
($DC0E) allows you to choose input or output modes.  In input mode, a
bit of data is read from the SP line (pin 5 of the User Port) whenever
a signal on the CNT line (pin 4) appears to let you know that it is
time for a read.  After eight bits are received this way, the data is
placed in the Serial Port Register, and an interrupt is generated to
let you know that the register should be read.

In output mode, you write data to the Serial Port Register, and it is
sent out over the SP line (pin 5 of the User Port), using Timer A for
the baud rate generator.  Whenever a byte of data is written to this
register, transmission will start as long as Timer A is running and in
continuous mode.  Data is sent at half the Timer A rage, and an output
will appear on the CNT line (pin 4 of the User Port) whenever a bit is
sent.  After all eight bits have been sent, an interrupt is generated
to indicate that it is time to load the next byte to send into the
Serial Register.

The Serial Data Register is not used by the 64, which does all of its
serial I/O through the regular data ports.

56333         $DC0D          CIAICR
Interrupt Control Register

Bit 0:  Read / did Timer A count down to 0?  (1=yes)
        Write/ enable or disable Timer A interrupt (1=enable, 0=disable)
Bit 1:  Read / did Timer B count down to 0?  (1=yes)
        Write/ enable or disable Timer B interrupt (1=enable, 0=disable)
Bit 2:  Read / did Time of Day Clock reach the alarm time?  (1=yes)
        Write/ enable or disable TOD clock alarm interrupt (1=enable,
        0=disable)
Bit 3:  Read / did the serial shift register finish a byte? (1=yes)
        Write/ enable or disable serial shift register interrupt (1=enable,
        0=disable)
Bit 4:  Read / was a signal sent on the flag line?  (1=yes)
        Write/ enable or disable FLAG line interrupt (1=enable, 0=disable)
Bit 5:  Not used
Bit 6:  Not used
Bit 7:  Read / did any CIA #1 source cause an interrupt?  (1=yes)
        Write/ set or clear bits of this register (1=bits written with 1 will
        be set, 0=bits written with 1 will be cleared)

This register is used to control the five interrupt sources on the
6526 CIA chip.  These sources are Timer A, Timer B, the Time of Day
Clock, the Serial Register, and the FLAG line.  Timers A and B cause
an interrupt when they count down to 0.  The Time of Day Clock
generates an interrupt when it reaches the ALARM time.  The Serial
Shift Register interrupts when it compiles eight bits of input or
output.  An external signal pulling the CIA hardware line called FLAG
low will also cause an interrupt (on CIA #1, this FLAG line is
connected to the Cassette Read line of the Cassette Port).

Even if the condition for a particular interrupt is satisfied, the
interrupt must still be enabled for an IRQ actually to occur.  This is
done by writing to the Interrupt Control Register.  What happens when
you write to this register depends on the way that you set Bit 7.  If
you set it to 0, any other bit that was written to with a 1 will be
cleared, and the corresponding interrupt will be disabled.  If you set
Bit 7 to 1, any bit written to with a 1 will be set, and the
corresponding interrupt will be enabled.  In either case, the
interrupt enable flags for those bits written to with a 0 will not be
affected.

For example, in order to disable all interrupts from BASIC, you could
POKE 56333, 127.  This sets Bit 7 to 0, which clears all of the other
bits, since they are all written with 1's.  Don't try this from BASIC
immediate mode, as it will turn off Timer A which causes the IRQ for
reading the keyboard, so that it will in effect turn off the keyboard.

To turn on the Timer A interrupt, a program could POKE 56333,129.  Bit
7 is set to 1 and so is Bit 0, so the interrupt which corresponds to
Bit 0 (Timer A) is enabled.

When you read this register, you can tell if any of the conditions for
a CIA Interrupt were satisfied because the corresponding bit will be
set to a 1.  For example, if Timer A counts down to 0, Bit 0 of this
register will be set to 1.  If, in addition, the mask bit that
corresponds to that interrupt source is set to 1, and an interrupt
occurs, Bit 7 will also be set.  This allows a multi-interrupt system
to read one bit and see if the source of a particular interrupt was
CIA #1.  You should note, however, that reading this register clears
it, so you should preserve its contents in RAM if you want to test
more than one bit.
