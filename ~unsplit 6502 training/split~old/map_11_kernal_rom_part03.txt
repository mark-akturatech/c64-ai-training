Set Up the Proper Keyboard Decode Table

This routine is pointed to by the vector at 655 ($28F).  Its function
is to read the shift/control flag at 653 ($28D), and set the value of
the decode table pointer at 245 ($F5) accordingly.

First it checks if the SHIFT/Commodore logo combination was pressed,
and if the toggle enable at 657 (291) will allow a change, the
character set will be changed to lowercase/uppercase or
uppercase/graphics by changing the VIC Memory Control Register at
53272 ($D018), and no character will be printed.

Next it sets the decode table pointer.  There are 64 keys, and each
can have four different PETASCII values, depending on whether the key
is pressed by itself, or in combination with the SHIFT, CTRL, or
Commodore logo keys.  Therefore, there are four tables of 64 entries
each to translate the keycode to PETASCII:  the standard table, the
SHIFT table, the Commodore logo table, and the CONTROL table.  The
routine will set up the pointer for the appropriate table, depending
on whether the SHIFT, CTRL, or logo key was pressed.  The CTRL key
takes precedence, so that if another of these keys is pressed along
with the CTRL key, the CONTROL table is used.

Keyboard Decode Table Vectors

This table contains the two-byte addresses of the four keyboard decode
tables in low-byte, high-byte format.

60289         $EB81
Standard Keyboard Matrix Decode Table

This table contains the 64 PETASCII values for the standard keyboard,
one for each key which is struck by itself.  The table is in keycode
order (see the keycode table in Appendix H for the correspondence of
keycode to key).  A 65th byte with the value of 255 ($FF) marks the
end of the table (this corresponds to a keypress value of 64, no key
pressed).

60354         $EBC2
SHIFTed Keyboard Matrix Decode Table

This table contains the 64 PETASCII values for the shifted keyboard,
one for each key which is struck while the SHIFT key is pressed.  The
table is in keycode order (see the keycode table in Appendix H for the
correspondence of keycode to key).  A 65th byte with the value of 255
($FF) marks the end of the table (this corresponds to a keypress value
of 64, no key pressed).

60419         $EC03
Commodore Logo Keyboard Matrix Decode Table

This table contains the 64 PETASCII values for the logo keyboard, one
for each key which is struck while the Commodore logo key is pressed.
The table is in keycode order (see the keycode table in Appendix H for
the correspondence of keycode to key).  A 65th byte with the value of
255 ($FF) marks the end of the table (this corresponds to a keypress
value of 64, no key pressed).

60484         $EC44
Set Lowercase/Uppercase or Uppercase/Graphics Character Set

The part of the Kernal CHROUT routine that outputs to the screen uses
this subroutine to check for the special nonprinting characters that
switch the character set (CHR$(14) and CHR$(142)).  If one of these is
the character to be printed, this routine makes the switch by setting
the location 53272 ($D018) accordingly.

60510         $EC5E
Set Flag to Enable or Disable Switching Character Sets

This subroutine is also used to check for special characters to print.
In this case, it checks for the characters that enable or disable the
SHIFT/logo combination from toggling the character set currently in
use (CHR$(8) and CHR$(9)).  If one of these is to be printed, the flag
at 657 ($291) is changed.

60536         $EC78
Control Keyboard Matrix Decode Table

This table contains the 64 PETASCII values for the Control keyboard,
one for each key which is struck while the CTRL key is pressed.  The
table is in keycode order (see the keycode table in Appendix H for the
correspondence of keycode to key).  A 65th byte with the value of 255
($FF) marks the end of the table (this corresponds to a keypress value
of 64, no key pressed).

The only keys generally struck in combination with the CTRL key are
the ones that change the colors on the top row of the keyboard, but
this doesn't necessarily mean that the other CTRL key combinations
don't do anything.  On the contrary, looking at the values in this
table, you can see that any of the first 32 values in the PETASCII
table can be produced by some combination of the CTRL key and another
key.  CTRL-@ produces a CHR$(0).  CTRL-A through CTRL-Z produce
CHR$(1) through CHR$(26).  Ctrl-: is the same as CHR$(27), CTRL-Lira
(that's the slashed-L British pound sign) produces CHR$(28), CTRL-;
equals CHR$(29), CTRL-up arrow produces CHR$(30), and CTRL-= produces
CHR$(31).

Any of these combinations produce the same effect as the CHR$(X)
statement.  For examble, CTRL-; moves the cursor over to the right,
CTRL-N switches to lowercase, CTRL-R turns on reverse video, and
CTRL-E changes the printing to white.

60601         $ECB9
Video Chip Register Default Table

This table contains the default values that are stored in the 47
VIC-II chip registers.  It is interesting to note that this table
appears to be incomplete.  While Sprite Color Registers 0-6 are
initialized to values of 1-7, Sprite Color Register 7 is initialized
to 76--the ASCII value of the letter L which begins on the next table.

60647         $ECE7
Text for Keyboard Buffer When SHIFT/RUN is Pressed

When the SHIFT and RUN keys are pressed, the ASCII text stored here is
forced into the keyboard buffer.  That text is LOAD, carriage return,
RUN, carriage return.

60656         $ECF0
Low Byte Table of Screen Line Addresses

This table holds the low byte of the screen address for lines 0-24.
The high byte is derived from combining a value from the screen line
link table at 217 ($D9) with the pointer to screen memory at 648
($288).

60681         $ED09          TALK
Send TALK to a Device on the Serial Bus

This is a documented Kernal routine whose entry in the jump table is
65460 ($FFB4).  When called, it ORs the device number in the
Accumulator with the TALK code (64, $40) and sends it on the serial
bus.  This commands the device to TALK.

60684         $ED0C          LISTEN

This is a documented Kernal routine whose entry in the jump table is
65457 ($FFB1).  When called, it ORs the device number in the
Accumulator with the LISTEN code (32, $20) and sends it on the serial
bus.  This commands the device to LISTEN.

60689         $ED11
Send Command Code to a Device on the Serial Bus

This subroutine is used in common by many Kernal routines to send the
command code in the Accumulator to a device on the serial bus.

60736         $ED40
Send a Byte on the Serial Bus

This subroutine is used in common by several Kernal routines to send
the byte in the serial bus character buffer at 149 ($95) on the serial
bus.

60848         $EDB0
Time-Out Error on Serial Bus

This subroutine handles the case when the device does not respond by
setting the DEVICE NOT PRESENT error code and exiting.

60857         $EDB9          SECOND
Send a Secondary Address to a Device on the Serial Bus after LISTEN

This is a documented Kernal routine that can be entered from the jump
table at 65427 ($FF93).  It sends a secondary address from the
Accumulator to the device on the serial bus that has just been
commanded to LISTEN.  This is usually done to give the device more
particular instructions on how the I/O is to be carried out before
information is sent.

60871         $EDC7          TKSA
Send a Secondary Address to a Device on the Serial Bus after TALK

This is a documented Kernal routine that can be entered from the jump
table at 65430 ($FF96).  It sends a secondary address from the
Accumulator to the device on the serial bus that has just been
commanded to TALK.  This is usually done to give the device more
particular instructions on how the I/O is to be carried out before
information is sent.

60893         $EDDD          CIOUT
Send a Byte to an I/O Device over the Serial Bus

This is a documented Kernal routine which can be entered from the jump
table at 65448 ($FFA8).  Its purpose is to send a byte of data over
the serial bus.  In order for the data to be received, the serial
device must have first been commanded to LISTEN and been given a
secondary address if necessary.  This routine always buffers the
current character, and defers sending it until the next byte is
buffered.  When the UNLISTEN command is sent, the last byte will be
sent with an End or Identify (EOI).

60911         $EDEF          UNTLK
Send UNTALK to a Device on the Serial Bus

This is a documented Kernal routine whose entry in the jump table is
65451 ($FFAB).  When called, it sends the UNTALK code (95, $5F) on the
serial bus.  This commands any TALKer on the bus to stop sending data.

60926         $EDFE          UNLSN
Send UNLISTED to a Device on the Serial Bus

This is a documented Kernal routine whose entry in the jump table is
65454 ($FFAE).  It sends the UNLISTEN code (63, $3F) on the serial
bus.  This commands any LISTENers to get off the serial bus, and frees
up the bus for other users.

60947         $EE13          ACPTR
Receive a Byte of Data from a Device on the Serial Bus

This is a documented Kernal routine whose entry point in the jump
table is 65445 ($FFA5).  When called, it will get a byte of data from
the current TALKer on the serial bus and store it in the Accumulator.
In order to receive the data, the device must have previously been
sent a command to TALK and a secondary address if it needs one.

61061         $EE85
Set the Serial Clock Line Low (Active)

of CIA #2 Data Port A at 56576 ($DD00)).

61079         $EE97
Set Serial Bus Data Output Line Low

This subroutine clears the serial bus data output to 0 (Bit 5 of CIA
#2 Data Port A at 56576 ($DD00)).

61097         $EEA9
Get Serial Bus Data Input Bit and Clock Pulse Input Bit

This subroutine reads the serial bus data input bit and clock pulse
input bit (Bits 7 and 6 of CIA #2 Data Port A at 56576 ($DD00)), and
returns the data bit in the Carry flag and the clock bit in the
Negative flag.

Setup to Receive a New Byte from RS-232

61328         $EF90
Test If Start Bit Received from RS-232

61335         $EF97
Put a Byte of Received Data into RS-232 Receive Buffer

This routine checks for a Receive Buffer Overrun, stores the byte just
received in the RS-232 receive buffer, and checks for Parity Error,
Framing Error, or Break Detected Error.  It then sets up to receive
the next byte.

61409         $EFE1
CHKOUT for the RS-232 device

The Kernal CHKOUT routine calls this subroutine to define the RS-232
device's logical file as an output channel.  Before this can be done,
the logical file must first be OPENed.

61460         $F014
CHROUT for the RS-232 Device

The Kernal CHROUT routine calls this subroutine to output a character
to the RS-232 device.  After the logical file has been OPENed and set
for output using CHKOUT, the CHROUT routine is used to actually send a
byte of data.

61517         $F04D
CHKIN for the RS-232 Device

The Kernal CHKIN routine calls this subroutine to define the RS-232
device's logical file as an input channel.  A prerequisite for this is
that the logical file first be OPENed.

61574         $F086
GETIN for the RS-232 Device

The Kernal GETIN routine calls this subroutine to remove the next byte
of data from the RS-232 receive buffer and return it in the
Accumulator.  The routine checks for the Receive Buffer Empty Error.
It is also called by the Kernal CHRIN routine, which essentially does
the same thing as GETIN for the RS-232 device.

61604         $F0A4
Stop CIA #2 RS-232 NMIs for Serial/Cassette Routines

This subroutine turns off the NMIs that drive the RS-232 routines
before any I/O is done using the serial bus or cassette device.  Such
interrupts could throw off the timing of those I/O routines, and
interfere with the transmission of data.

61629         $F0BD
Kernal Control Messages

The ASCII text of the Kernal I/O control messages is stored here.  The
last byte of every message has Bit 7 set to 1 (ASCII value + 128).
The messages are:

I/O ERROR
SEARCHING
FOR
PRESS PLAY ON TAPE
PRESS RECORD & PLAY ON TAPE
LOADING
SAVING
VERIFYING
FOUND
OK

61739         $F12B
Print Kernal Error Message if in Direct Mode

This routine first checks location 157 ($9D) to see if the messages
are enabled.  If they are, it prints the message indexed by the .Y
register.

61758         $F13E          GETIN
Get One Byte from the Input Device

This is a documented Kernal routine whose jump table entry point is at
65508 ($FFE4).  The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 810 ($32A).
Its function is to get a character from the current input device
(whose device number is stored at 153 ($99)).  In practive, it
operates identically to the CHRIN routine below for all devices except
for the keyboard.  If the keyboard is the current input device, this
routine gets one character from the keyboard buffer at 631 ($277).  It
depends on the IRQ interrupt routine to rad the keyboard and put
characters into the buffer.
