                                in practice this routine operates identically to the CHRIN routine, $FFCF,
                                for all devices except for the keyboard. If the keyboard is the current input
                                device this routine will get one character from the keyboard buffer. It depends
                                on the IRQ routine to read the keyboard and put characters into the buffer.
                                If the keyboard buffer is empty the value returned in the accumulator will be zero.

                                this routine closes all open files. When this routine is called, the pointers into
                                the open file table are reset, closing all files. Also the routine automatically
                                resets the I/O channels.

                                this routine updates the system clock. Normally this routine is called by the
                                normal KERNAL interrupt routine every 1/60th of a second. If the user program
                                processes its own interrupts this routine must be called to update the time. Also,
                                the STOP key routine must be called if the stop key is to remain functional.

                                this routine, when called with the carry flag set, loads the current position of
                                the cursor on the screen into the X and Y registers. X is the column number of
                                the cursor location and Y is the row number of the cursor. A call with the carry
                                bit clear moves the cursor to the position determined by the X and Y registers.

                                mapped I/O devices are located. This address can then be used with an offset to
