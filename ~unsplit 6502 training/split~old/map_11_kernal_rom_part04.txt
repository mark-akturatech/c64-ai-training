61783         $F157          CHRIN
Input a Character from the Current Device

This is a documented Kernal routine whose jump table entry point is at
65487 ($FFCF).

The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 804 ($324).  Its function is
to get a character from the current input device (whose device number
is stored at 153 ($99)).  This device must first have been OPENed and
then designated as the input channel by the CHKIN routine.

When this routine is called, the next byte of data available from this
device is returned in the Accumulator.  The only exception is the
routine for the keyboard device (which is the default input device).
It the keyboard is the current input device, this routine blinks the
cursor, fetches characters from the keyboard buffer, and echoes them
to the screen until a carriage return is encountered.  When a carriage
return is round, the routine sets a flag to indicate the length of the
last logical line before the return character, and reads the first
character of this logical line from the screen.

Subsequent calls to this routine will cause the next character in the
line to be read from the screen and returned in the Accumulator, until
the carriage return character is returned to indicate the end of the
line.  Any call after this character is received will start the whole
process over again.

Note that only the last logical line before the carriage return is
used.  Any time you type in more than 80 characters, a new logical
line is started.  This routine will ignore any characters on the old
logical line, and process only the most recent 80-character group.

61898         $F1CA          CHROUT
Output a Byte

This is a documented Kernal routine whose jump table entry point is at
65490 ($FFD2).  The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 806 ($326).
It is probably one of the best known and most used Kernal routines,
because it sends the character in the Accumulator to the current
output device.  Unless a device has been OPENed and designated as the
current output channel using the CHKOUT routine, the character is
printed to the screen, which is the default output device.  If the
cassette is the current device, outputting a byte will only add it to
the buffer.  No actual transmission of data will occur until the
192-byte buffer is full.

61966         $F20E          CHKIN
Designate a Logical File As the Current Input Channel

This is a documented Kernal routine which can be entered from the jump
table at 65478 ($FFC6).

The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 798 ($31E).  If you wish to
get data from any device other than the keyboard, this routine must be
called after OPENing the device, before you can get a data byte with
the CHRIN or GETIN routine.  When called, the routine will designate
the logical file whose file number is in the .X register as the
current file, its device as the current device, and its secondary
address as the current secondary address.  If the device on the
channel is a serial device, which requires a TALK command and
sometimes a secondary address, this routine will send them over the
serial bus.

62032         $F250          CHKOUT
Designate a Logical File As the Current Output Channel

This is a documented Kernal routine which can be entered from the jump
table at 65481 ($FFC9).

The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 800 ($320).  If you wish to
output data to any device other than the screen, this routine must be
called after OPENing the device, and before you output a data byte
with the CHROUT routine.  When called, the routine will designate the
logical file whose file number is in the .X register as the current
file, its device as the current device, and its secondary address as
the current secondary address.  If the device on the channel uses the
serial bus, and therefore requires a LISTEN command and possibly a
secondary address, this information will be sent on the bus.

62097         $F291          CLOSE
Close a Logical I/O File

CLOSE is a documented Kernal routine which can be entered via the jump
table at 65475 ($FFC3).

The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 796 ($31C).  It is used to
close a logical file after all I/O operations involving that file have
been completed.  This is accomplished by loading the Accumulator with
the logical file number of the file to be closed, and calling this
routine.

Closing an RS-232 file will de-allocate space at the top of memory for
the receiving and trasmit buffers.  Closing a cassette file that was
opened for writing will force the last block to be written to
cassette, even if it is not a full 192 bytes.  Closing a serial bus
device will send an UNLISTEN command on the bus.  Remember, it is
necessary to properly CLOSE a cassette or disk data file in order to
retrieve the file later.

For all types of files, CLOSE removes the file's entry from the tables
of logical files, device, and secondary address at 601, 611, and 621
($259, $263, $26D), and moves all higher entries in the table down one
space.

62223         $F30F
Find the File in the Logical File Table

This subroutine is used by many Kernal routines to find the position
of the logical file in the logical file table at 601 ($259).

62239         $F31F
Set Current Logical File, Current Device, and Current Seconday Address

This subroutine is used to update the Kernal variables at 184-186
($B8-$BA) which holds the current logical file number, current device
number, and current secondary address number.

62255         $F32F          CLALL
Close All Logical I/O Files

CLALL is a documented Kernal routine whose entry point in the jump
table is 65511 ($FFE7).

The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 812 ($32C).  It closes all
open files, by resetting the index into open files at 152 ($98) to
zero.  It then falls through to the next routine, which restores the
default I/O devices.

62259         $F333          CLRCHN
Restore Current Input and Output Devices to the Default Devices

This is a documented Kernal Routine which can be entered at location
65484 ($FFCC) in the jump table.

The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 802 ($322).  It sets the
current input device to the keyboard, and the current output device to
the screen.  Also, if the current input device was formerly a serial
device, the routine sends it an UNTALK command on the serial bus, and
if a serial device was formerly the current output device, the routine
sends it an UNLISTEN command.

62282         $F34A          OPEN
Open a Logical I/O File

OPEN is a documented Kernal I/O routine.  It can be entered from the
jump table at 65472 ($FFC0).

The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 794 ($31A).  This routine
assigns a logical file to a device, so that it can be used for
Input/Output operations.  In order to specify the logical file number,
the device number, and the secondary address if any, the SETLFS
routine must first be called.  Likewise, in order to designate the
filename, the SETNAM routine must be used first.  After these two
routines are called, OPEN is then called.

62622         $F49E          LOAD
Load RAM from a Device

This is a documented Kernal routine, whose entry in the jump table
appears at 65493 ($FFD5).

The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 816 ($330).  LOAD is used to
transfer data froma device directly to RAM.  It can also be used to
verify RAM, comparing its contents to those of a disk or tape file.
To choose between these operations you must set the Accumulator with a
0 for LOAD, or a 1 for VERIFY.

Since the LOAD routine performs an OPEN, it must be preceded by a call
to the SETLFS routine to specify the logical file number, device
number, and secondary address, and a call to the SETNAM routine to
specify the filename (a LOAD from tape can be performed without a
filename being specified).  Then the .X and .Y registers should be set
with the starting address for the load, and the LOAD routine called.
If the secondary address specified was a 1, this starting address will
be ignored, and the header information will be used to supply the load
address.  If the secondary address was a 0, the address supplied by
the call will be used.  In either case, upon return from the
subroutine, the .X and .Y registers will contain the address of the
highest RAM location that was loaded.

62941         $F5DD          SAVE
Save RAM to a Device

This is a documented Kernal routine, whose entry in the jump table
appears at 65496 ($FFD8).

The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 818 ($332).  SAVE is used to
transfer data directly from RAM to an I/O device.  Since the SAVE
routine performs an OPEN, it must be preceded by a call to the SETLFS
routine to specify the logical file number, device number, and
secondary address, and a call to the SETNAM routine to specify the
filename (although a SAVE to the cassette can be performed without
giving a filename).  A Page 0 pointer to the starting address of the
area to be saved should be set up, with the low byte of the address
first.  The accumulator should be loaded with the Page 0 offset of
that pointer, then the .X and .Y registers should be set with the
ending address for the save, and the SAVE routine called.

63131         $F69B          UDTIM
Update the Software Clock and Check for the STOP Key

UDTIM is a documented Kernal routine which can be entered through the
jump table at 65514 ($FFEA).

It is normally called by the IRQ interrupt handler once every sixtieth
of a second.  It adds one to the value in the three-byte software
jiffy clock at 160-162 ($A0-$A2), and sets the clock back to zero when
it reaches the 24 hour point.  In addition, it scans the keyboard row
in which the STOP key is located, and stores the current value of that
key in location 145 ($91).  This variable is used by the STOP routine
which checks for the STOP key.

63197         $F6DD          RDTIM
Read the Time From the Software Clock into the .A, .X, and .Y
Registers

This is a documented Kernal routine whose entry point in the jump
table is 65502 ($FFDE).

It reads the software clock (which counts sixtieths of a second) into
the internal registers.  The .Y register contains the most significant
byte (from location 160 ($A0)), the .X register contains the middle
byte (from location 161 ($A1)), and the Accumulator contains the least
significant byte (from location 162 ($A2)).

63204         $F6E4          SETTIM
Set the Software Clock from the .A, .X, and .Y Registers

This documented Kernal routine can be entered from location 65499
($FFDB).

It performs the reverse operation from RDTIM, storing the value in the
.Y register into location 160 ($A0), the .X register into 161 ($A1),
and the Accumulator into 162 ($A2).  Interrupts are first disabled, to
make sure that the clock will not be updated while being set.

63213         $F6ED          STOP
Test STOP Key

STOP is a documented Kernal routine which can be entered from the jump
table at location 65505 ($FFE1).

It is vectored through RAM at 808 ($328).  The routine checks to see
if the STOP key was pressed during the last UDTIM call.  If it was,
the Zero flag is set to 1, the CLRCHN routine is called to set the
input and output devices back to the keyboard and screen, and the
keyboard queue is emptied.

63227         $F6FB
Set Kernal I/O Error Messages

This subroutine is used to handle I/O errors from Kernal I?O routines.
It calls CLRCHN to restore default I/O devices.  If Bit 6 of the flag
at 157 ($9D) is set, it prints I/O ERROR followed by the error number,
and then sets the Carry flag to indicate an error, with the error
number in the Accumulator.  The Kernal error messages are not used by
BASIC, but may be used by machine language monitors and other
applications.

63276         $F72C
Get Next Tape File Header from Cassette

This routine reads in tape blocks until it finds a file header block.
It then prints out the FOUND message along with the first 16
characters of the filename.

Test Cassette Buttons and Handle Messages for Tape Read

This routine tests the sense switch, and if no buttons are depressed
it prints the PRESS PLAY ON TAPE message, and loops until a cassette
button is pressed, or until the STOP key is pressed.  If a button is
pressed, it prints the message OK.

Since the message printing routine is entered after the test for
direct mode, these messages cannot be superseded by changing the flag
at 157 ($9D).  You could have them harmlessly printed to ROM, however,
by changing the value of HIBASE at 648 ($288) temporarily to 160, and
then back to 4.

63534         $F82E
Check Cassette Switch

This subroutine is used to check if a button on the recorder has been
pressed.

63544         $F838
Test Cassette Buttons and Handle Messages for Tape Write

This routine tests the sense switch, and if no buttons are depressed
it prints the PRESS PLAY & RECORD message, and loops until a cassette
button is pressed, or until the STOP key is pressed.  If a button is
pressed, it prints the message OK.  These messages cannot be supressed
by changing the flag at 157 ($9D).  See the entry for 63511 ($F817)
for more information.

63553         $F841
Start Reading a Block of Data from the Cassette

This subroutine tests the cassette switch and initializes various
flags for reading a block of data from cassette.

63588         $F864
Start Writing a Block of Data to the Cassette

This subroutine tests the cassette switch and initializes various
flags for writing a block of data to cassette.

63605         $F875
Common Code for Reading a Data Block from Tape and Writing a Block to Tape

This routine sets the actual reading or writing of a block of data.
It sets CIA #1 Timer B to call the IRQ which drives the actual reading
or writing routine, saves the old IRQ vector, and sets the new IRQ
vector to the read or write routine.  It also blanks the screen so
that the video chip's memory addressing (which normally takes away
some of the 6510 microprocessor's addressing time) will not interfere
with the timing of the routines.

63696         $F8D0
Test the STOP Key during Cassette I/O Operations

This subroutine is used to test the STOP key during tape I/O
oeprations, and to stop I/O if it is pressed.

This is the IRQ handler routine that is used for reading data from the
cassette.  At the end of the read, the IRQ vector is restored to the
normal IRQ routine.
