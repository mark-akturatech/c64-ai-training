Control Register A

Bit 0:  Start Timer A (1=start, 0=stop)
Bit 1:  Select Timer A output on Port B (1=Timer A output appears on Bit 6 of
        Port B)
Bit 2:  Port B output mode (1=toggle Bit 6, 0=pulse Bit 6 for one cycle)
Bit 3:  Timer A run mode (1=one-shot, 0=continuous)
Bit 4:  Force latched value to be loaded to Timer A counter (1=force load
        strobe)
Bit 5:  Timer A input mode (1=count microprocessor cycles, 0=count signals on
        CNT line at pin 4 of User Port)
Bit 6:  Serial Port (56332, $DC0C) mode (1=output, 0=input)
Bit 7:  Time of Day Clock frequency (1=50 Hz required on TOD pin, 0=60 Hz)

Bits 0-3.  This nybble controls Timer A.  Bit 0 is set to 1 to start
the timer counting down, and set to 0 to stop it.  Bit 3 sets the
timer for one-shot or continuous mode.

In one-shot mode, the timer counts down to 0, sets the counter value
back to the latch value, and then sets Bit 0 back to 0 to stop the
timer.  In continuous mode, it reloads the latch value and starts all
over again.

Bits 1 and 2 allow you to send a signal on Bit 6 of Data Port B when
the timer counts.  Setting Bit 1 to 1 forces this output (which
overrides the Data Direction Register B Bit 6, and the normal Data
Port B value).  Bit 2 allows you to choose the form this output to Bit
6 of Data Port B will take.  Setting Bit 2 to a value of 1 will cause
Bit 6 to toggle to the opposite value when the timer runs down (a
value of 1 will change to 0, and a value of 0 will change to 1).
Setting Bit 2 to a value of 0 will cause a single pulse of a one
machine-cycle duration (about a millionth of a second) to occur.

Bit 4.  This bit is used to load the Timer A counter with the value
that was previously written to the Timer Low and High Byte Registers.
Writing a 1 to this bit will force the load (although there is no data
stored here, and the bit has no significance on a read).

Bit 5.  Bit 5 is used to control just what it is Timer A is counting.
If this bit is set to 1, it counts the microprocessor machine cycles
(which occur at the rate of 1,022,730 cycles per second).  If the bit
is set to 0, the timer counts pulses on the CNT line, which is
connected to pin 4 of the User Port.  This allows you to use the CIA
as a frequency counter or an event counter, or to measure pulse width
or delay times of external signals.

Bit 6.  Whether the Serial Port Register is currently inputting or
outputting data (see the entry for that register at 56332 ($DC0C) for
more information) is controlled by this bit.

Bit 7.  This bit allows you to select from software whether the Time
of Day Clock will use a 50 Hz or 60 Hz signal on the TOD pin in order
to keep accurate time (the 64 uses a 60 Hz signal on that pin).

Control Register B

Bit 0:  Start Timer B (1=start, 0=stop)
Bit 1:  Select Timer B output on Port B (1=Timer B output appears on
        Bit 7 of Port B)
Bit 2:  Port B output mode (1=toggle Bit 7, 0=pulse Bit 7 for one
        cycle)
Bit 3:  Timer B run mode (1=one-shot, 0=continuous)
Bit 4:  Force latched value to be loaded to Timer B counter (1=force
        load strobe)
Bits 5-6:  Timer B input mode
           00 = Timer B counts microprocessor cycles
           01 = Count signals on CNT line at pin 4 of User Port
           10 = Count each time that Timer A counts down to 0
           11 = Count Timer A 0's when CNT pulses are also present
Bit 7:  Select Time of Day write (0=writing to TOD registers sets
        alarm, 1=writing to TOD registers sets clock)

Bits 0-3.  This nybble performs the same functions for Timer B that
Bits 0-3 of Control Register A perform for Timer A, except that Timer
B output on Data Port B appears at Bit 7, and not Bit 6.

Bits 5 and 6.  These two bits are used to select what Timer B counts.
If both bits are set to 0, Timer B counts the microprocessor machine
cycles (which occur at the rate of 1,022,730 cycles per second).  If
Bit 6 is set to 0 and Bit 5 is set to 1, Timer B counts pulses on the
CNT line, which is connected to pin 4 of the User Port.  If Bit 6 is
set to 1 and Bit 5 is set to 0, Timer B counts Timer A underflow
pulses, which is to say that it counts the number of times that Timer
A counts down to 0.  This is used to link the two numbers into one
32-bit timer that can count up to 70 minutes with accuracy to within
1/15 second.  Finally, if both bits are set to 1, Timer B counts the
number of times that Timer A counts down to 0 and there is a signal on
the CNT line (pin 4 of the User Port).

Bit 7.  Bit 7 controls what happens when you write to the Time of Day
registers.  If this bit is set to 1, writing to the TOD registers sets
the ALARM time.  If this bit is cleared to 0, writing to the TOD
registers sets the TOD clock.

CIA #1 Register Images

Since the CIA chip requires only enough addressing lines to handle 16
registers, none of the higher bits are decoded when addressing the
256-byte area that has been assigned to it.  The result is that every
16-byte area in this 256-byte block is a mirror of every other.  Even
so, for the sake of clarity in your programs it is advisable to use
the base address of the chip, and not use the higher addresses to
communicate with the chip.

Complex Interface Adapter (CIA) #2 Registers

Locations 56576-56591 ($DD00-$DD0F) are used to address the Complex
Interface Adapter chip #2 (CIA #2).  Since the chip itself is
identical to CIA #1, which is addressed at 56320 ($DC00), the
discussion here will be limited to the use which the 64 makes of this
particular chip.  For more general information on the chip registers,
please see the corresponding entries for CIA #1.

One of the significant differences between CIA chips #1 and #1 is the
use to which Data Ports A and B are put.  The peripheral input and
output devices that CIA #2 controls are those on the Serial Bus (such
as the 1541 Disk Drive and 1525 printer), the RS-232 device (which is
used for telecommunications), and the User Port, an eight-bit parallel
port that can be turned to whatever purpose the user desires.  In
addition, Data Port A has the important task of selecting the 16K bank
ofmemory that will be used by the VIC-II chip for graphics.

Another significant difference between CIA chips #1 and #2 is that the
interrupt line of CIA #1 is wired to the 6510 IRQ line, while that of
CIA #2 is wired to the NMI line.  This means that interrupts from this
chip cannot be masked by setting the Interrupt disable flag (SEI).
They can be disabled from CIA's Mask Register, though.  Be sure to use
the NMI vector when setting up routines to be driven by interrupts
generated by this chip.
