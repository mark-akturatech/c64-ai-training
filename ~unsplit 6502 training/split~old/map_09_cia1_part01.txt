56320-56335   $DC00-$DC0F
Complex Interface Adapter (CIA) #1 Registers

Locations 56320-56335 ($DC00-$DC0F) are used to communicate with the
Complex Interface Adapter chip #1 (CIA #1).  This chip is a successor
to the earlier VIA and PIA devices used on the VIC-20 and PET.  This
chip functions the same way as the VIA and PIA:  It allows the 6510
microprocessor to communicate with peripheral input and output
devices.  The specific devices that CIA #1 reads data from and sends
data to are the joystick controllers, the paddle fire buttons, and the
keyboard.

In addition to its two data ports, CIA #1 has two timers, each of
which can count an interval from a millionth of a second to a
fifteenth of a second.  Or the timers can be hooked together to count
much longer intervals.  CIA #1 has an interrupt line which is
connected to the 6510 IRQ line.  These two timers can be used to
generate interrupts at specified intervals (such as the 1/60 second
interrupt used for keyboard scanning, or the more complexly timed
interrupts that drive the tape read and write routines).  As you will
see below, the CIA chip has a host of other features to aid in
Input/Output functions.

Location Range: 56320-56321 ($DC00-$DC01)
CIA #1 Data Ports A and B

These registers are where the actual communication with outside
devices takes place.  Bits of data written to these registers can be
sent to external devices, while bits of data that those devices send
can be read here.

The keyboard is so necessary to the computer's operation that you may
have a hard time thinking of it as a peripheral device.  Nonetheless,
it cannot be directly read by the 6510 microprocessor.  Instead, the
keys are connected in a matrix of eight rows by eight columns to CIA
#1 Ports A and B.  The layout of this matrix is shown below.

As you can see, there are two keys which do not appear in the matrix.
The SHIFT LOCK key is not read as a separate key, but rather is a
mechanical device which holds the left SHIFT key switch in a closed
position.  The RESTORE key is not read like the other keys either.  It
is directly connected to the NMI interrupt line of the 6510
microprocessor, and causes an NMI interrupt to occur whenever it is
pressed (not just when it is pressed with the STOP key).

In order to read the individual keys in the matrix, you must first set
Port A for all outputs (255, $FF), and Port B for all inputs (0),
using the Data Direction Registers.  Note that this is the default
condition.  Next, you must write a 0 in the bit of Data Port A that
corresponds to the column that you wish to read, and a 1 to the bits
that correspond to columns you wish to ignore.  You will then be able
to read Data Port B to see which keys in that column are being pushed.

A 0 in any bit position signifies that the key in the corresponding
row of the selected column is being pressed, while a 1 indicates that
the key is not being pressed.  A value of 255 ($FF) means that no keys
in that column are being pressed.

Fortunately for us all, an interrupt routine causes the keyboard to be
read, and the results are made available to the Operating System
automatically every 1/60 second.  And even when the normal interrupt
routine cannot be used, you can use the Kernal SCNKEY routine at 65439
($FF9F) to read the keyboard.

These same data ports are also used to read the joystick controllers.
Although common sense might lead you to believe that you could read
the joystick that is plugged into the port marked Controller Port 1
from Data Port A, and the second joystick from Data Port B, there is
nothing common about the Commodore 64.  Controller Port 1 is read from
Data Port B, and Controller Port 2 is read from CIA #1 Data Port A.

Joysticks consist of five switches, one each for up, down, right, and
left directions, and another for the fire button.  The switches are
read like the key switches--if the switch is pressed, the
corresponding bit will read 0, and if it is not pressed, the bit will
be set to 1.  From BASIC, you can PEEK the ports and use the AND and
NOT operators to mask the unused bits and inverse the logic for easier
comprehension.  For example, to read the joystick in Controller Port
1, you could use the statement:

S1=NOT PEEK(56321)AND15

The meaning of the possible numbers returned are:

 0 = none pressed
 1 = up
 2 = down
 4 = left
 5 = up left
 6 = down left
 8 = right
 9 = up right
10 = down right

The same technique can be used for joystick 2, by substituting 56320
as the number to PEEK.  By the way, the 3 and 7 aren't listed because
they represent impossible combinations like up-down.

To read the fire buttons, you can PEEK the appropriate port and use
the AND operator to mask all but bit 4:

T1=(PEEK(56321)AND16)/16

The above will return a 0 if the button is pressed, and a 1 if it is
not.  Substitute location 56320 as the location to PEEK for Trigger
Button 2.

Since CIA #1 Data Port B is used for reading the keyboard as well as
joystick 1, some confusion can result.  The routine that checks the
keyboard has no way of telling whether a particular bit was set to 0
by a keypress or one of the joystick switches.  For example, if you
plug the joystick into Controller Port 1 and push the stick to the
right, the routine will interpret this as the 2 key being pressed,
because both set the same bit to 0.  Likewise, when you read the
joystick, it will register as being pushed to the right if the 2 key
is being pressed.

The problem of mistaking the keyboard for the joystick can be solved
by turning off the keyscan momentarily when reading the stick with a
POKE 56333, 127:POKE 56320,255, and restoring it after the read with a
POKE 56333,129.  Sometimes you can use the simpler solution of
clearing the keyboard buffer after reading the joystick, with a POKE
198,0.

The problem of mistaking the joystick for a keypress is much more
difficult--there is no real way to turn off the joystick.  Many
commercially available games just use Controller Port 2 to avoid the
conflict.  So, if you can't beat them, sit back and press your
joystick to the left in order to slow down a program listing (the
keyscan routine thinks that it is the CTRL key).

As if all of the above were not enough, Port A is also used to control
which set of paddles is read by the SID chip, and to read the paddle
fire buttons.  Since there are two paddles per joystick Controller
Port, and only two SID registers for reading paddle positions, there
has to be a method for switching the paddle read from joystick Port 1
to joystick Port 2.

When Bit 7 of Port A is set to 1 and Bit 6 is cleared to 0, the SID
registers will read the paddles on Port 1.  When Bit 7 is set to 0 and
Bit 6 is set to 1, the paddles on Port 2 are read by the SID chip
registers.  Note that this also conflicts with the keyscan routine,
which is constantly writing different values to CIA #1 Data Port A in
order to select the keyboard column to read (most of the time, the
value for the last column is written to this port, which coincides
with the selection of paddles on joystick Port 1).  Therefore, in
order to get an accurate reading, you must turn off the keyscan IRQ
and select which joystick port you want to read.  See POTX at 54297
($D419), which is the SID register where the paddles are read, for the
exact technique.

Although the SID chip is used to read the paddle settings, the fire
buttons are read at CIA #1 Data Ports A and B.  The fire buttons for
the paddles plugged into Controller Port 1 are read at Data Port B
(56321, $DC01), while those for the paddles plugged into Controller
Port 2 are read from Data Port A (56320, $DC00).  The fire buttons are
read at Bit 2 and Bit 3 of each port (the same as the joystick left
and joystick right switches), and as usual, the bit will read 0 if the
corresponding button is pushed, and 1 if it is not.

Although only two of the rout paddle values can be read at any one
time, you can always read all four paddle buttons.  See the game
paddle input description at 54297 ($D419) for the BASIC statements
used to read these buttons.

Finally, Data Port B can also be used as an output by either Timer A
or B.  It is possible to set a mode in which the timers do not cause
an interrupt when they run down (see the descriptions of Control
Registers A and B at 56334-5 ($DC0E-F)).  Instead, they cause the
output on Bit 6 or 7 of Data Port B to change.  Timer A can be set
either to pulse the output of Bit 6 for one machine cycle, or to
toggle that bit from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1.  Timer B can use Bit 7 of this
register for the same purpose.

CIA #1 Data Direction Registers A and B

These Data Direction Registers control the direction of data flow over
Data Ports A and B.  Each bit controls the direction of the data on
the corresponding bit of the port.  If teh bit of the Direction
Register is set to a 1, the corresponding Data Port bit will be used
for data output.  If the bit is set to a 0, the corresponding Data
Port bit will be used for data input.  For example, Bit 7 of Data
Direction Register A controls Bit 7 of Data Port A, and if that
direction bit is set to 0, Bit 7 of Data Port A will be used for data
input.  If the direction bit is set to 1, however, data Bit 7 on Port
A will be used for data output.

The default setting for Data Direction Register A is 255 (all
outputs), and for Data Direction Register B it is 0 (all inputs).
This corresponds to the setting used when reading the keyboard (the
keyboard column number is written to Data Port A, and the row number
is then read in Data Port B).
