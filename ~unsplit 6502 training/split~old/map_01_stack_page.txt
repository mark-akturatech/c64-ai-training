256-511       $100-$1FF
Microprocessor Stack Area

Locations 256-511 are reserved for the 6510 microprocessor hardware
stack.  The organization of this temporary storage area has often been
compared to that of a push-down stack of trays at a cafeteria.  The
first number placed on the stack goes to the bottom, and subsequent
entries are placed on top of it.  Then you pull a number off the
stack, you come up with the last number that was pushed on (such a
stack is called a Last In, First Out, or LIFO stack).

The stack is controlled by one of the microprocessor registers called
the Stack Pointer, which keeps track of the last stack location used.
The first number placed on the stack goes to location 511 ($1FF), and
subsequent entries are built downward toward 256 ($100).  If more than
256 numbers are pushed onto the stack, the Stack Pointer will start
counting from 0 again, and an overflow error will result.  Likewise,
if you try to pull more items off the stack than have been pushed on,
an underflow error will result.  Most often, such errors will cause
the system to go haywire, and nothing will operate until you turn the
power off and on again.

The stack is used by the system to keep track of the return addresses
of machine language subroutines and interrupt calls and to save the
contents of internal registers.  The stack can also be used by the
programmer for temporary storage.  BASIC and the Kernal make heavy use
of the stack.

Microsoft BASIC uses part of the stack for a temporary work area.
Therefore, the stack may be broken down into the following subregions:

256-266       $100-$10A
Work Area for Floating Point to String Conversions

Used in the conversion of numbers to the equivalent ASCII digits, and
in scanning strings.

256-318       $100-$13E      BAD
Tape Input Error Log

Each tape block is saved twice consecutively, in order to minimize
loss of data from transmission errors.  These 62 bytes serve as
indices of which bytes in the tape block were not received corectly
during the first transmission, so that corrections might be made on
the second pass.

319-511       $13F-$1FF

This area is exclusively for the microprocessor stack.  Some BASIC
commands, such as FOR-NEXT loops require many stack entries at a time.
Therefore, BASIC frequently checks the stack before pushing entries
on, and returns an OUT OF MEMORY error if an operation would result in
less than 62 bytes of available stack memory.

Each FOR statement causes 18 bytes to be pushed onto the stack, which
come off in the following order:

First comes a one-byte constant of 129 ($81).  Next is a two-byte
pointer to the address of the subject variable (the X of FOR X=1 to
10).  This is followed by the five-byte floating point representation
of the TO value.  Finally comes the two-byte line number of the line
to which the program returns after a NEXT, and the two-byte address of
the next character to read in that line after the FOR statement.

Each GOSUB call places five bytes on the stack.  The first byte to
come off is a one-byte constant of 141 ($8D).  The next two bytes
contain the line number of the statement to which the program will
RETURN after the subroutine ends.  And the final two bytes are a
pointer to the address of the BASIC program text for that statement in
which the program RETURNs.

DEF also leaves a five-byte entry on the stack.  It is the same as
that described for GOSUB, except that instead of a constant byte of
141, the first number is a dummy byte, whose value has no
significance.
