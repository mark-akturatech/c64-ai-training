# C64 PRG Appendix - Memory Maps Overview


  BAD DATA            String data was received from an open file, but the
                      program was expecting numeric data.
  BAD SUBSCRIPT       The program was trying to reference an element of an
                      array whose number is outside of the range specified
                      in the DIM statement.
  BREAK               Program execution was stopped because you hit the
                      <STOP> key.
  CAN'T CONTINUE      The CONT command will not work, either because the
                      program was never RUN, there has been an error, or
                      a line has been edited.
  DEVICE NOT PRESENT  The required I/O device was not available for an
                      OPEN, CLOSE, CMD, PRINT#, INPUT#, or GET#.
  DIVISION BY ZERO    Division by zero is a mathematical oddity and not
                      allowed.
  EXTRA IGNORED       Too many items of data were typed in response to an
                      INPUT statement. Only the first few items were
                      accepted.
  FILE NOT FOUND      If you were looking for a file on tape, and END-OF-
                      TAPE marker was found. If you were looking on disk,
                      no file with that name exists.
  FILE NOT OPEN       The file specified in a CLOSE, CMD, PRINT#, INPUT#,
                      or GET#, must first be OPENed.
  FILE OPEN           An attempt was made to open a file using the number
                      of an already open file.
  FORMULA TOO COMPLEX The string expression being evaluated should be split
                      into at least two parts for the system to work with,
                      or a formula has too many parentheses.
  ILLEGAL DIRECT      The INPUT statement can only be used within a pro-
                      gram, and not in direct mode.
  ILLEGAL QUANTITY    A number used as the argument of a function or
                      statement is out of the allowable range.

  LOAD                There is a problem with the program on tape.
  NEXT WITHOUT FOR    This is caused by either incorrectly nesting loops or
                      having a variable name in a NEXT statement that
                      doesn't correspond with one in a FOR statement.
  NOT INPUT FILE      An attempt was made to INPUT or GET data from a file
                      which was specified to be for output only.
  NOT OUTPUT FILE     An attempt was mode to PRINT data to a file which was
                      specified as input only.
  OUT OF DATA         A READ statement was executed but there is no data
                      left unREAD in a DATA statement.
  OUT OF MEMORY       There is no more RAM available for program or
                      variables. This may also occur when too many FOR
                      loops have been nested, or when there are too many
                      GOSUBs in effect.
  OVERFLOW            The result of a computation is larger than the
                      largest number allowed, which is 1.70141884E+38.
  REDIM'D ARRAY       An array may only be DiMensioned once. If an array
                      variable is used before that array is DIM'D, an
                      automatic DIM operation is performed on that array
                      setting the number of elements to ten, and any
                      subsequent DIMs will cause this error.
  REDO FROM START     Character data was typed in during an INPUT statement
                      when numeric data was expected. Just re-type the
                      entry so that it is correct, and the program will
                      continue by itself.
  RETURN WITHOUT GOSUB  A RETURN statement was encountered, and no GOSUB
                      command has been issued.
  STRING TOO LONG     A string can contain up to 255 characters.
  ?SYNTAX ERROR       A statement is unrecognizable by the Commodore 64. A
                      missing or extra parenthesis, misspelled keywords,
                      etc.
  TYPE MISMATCH       This error occurs when a number is used in place of a
                      string, or vice-versa.
  UNDEF'D FUNCTION    A user defined function was referenced, but it has
                      never been defined using the DEF FN statement.
  UNDEF'D STATEMENT   An attempt was made to GOTO or GOSUB or RUN a line
                      number that doesn't exist.
  VERIFY              The program on tape or disk does not match the
                      program currently in memory.
