  PROGRAMMING SPRITES - ANOTHER LOOK

    For those of you having trouble with graphics, this section has been
  designed as a more elementary tutorial approach to sprites.

  MAKING SPRITES IN BASIC - A SHORT PROGRAM

    There are at least three different BASIC programming techniques which
  let you create graphic images and cartoon animations on the Commodore 64.
  You can use the computer's built-in graphics character set (see Page
  376). You can program your own characters (see Page 108) or... best of
  all... you can use the computer's built-in "sprite graphics. To
  illustrate how easy it is, here's one of the shortest spritemaking
  programs you can write in BASIC:

start tok64 page153.prg
  10 print"{clear}"
  20 poke2040,13
  30 fors=832to832+62:pokes,255:next
  40 v=53248
  50 pokev+21,1
  60 pokev+39,1
  70 pokev,24
  80 pokev+1,100
stop tok64

    This program includes the key "ingredients" you need to create any
  sprite. The POKE numbers come from the SPRITEMAKING CHART on Page 176.
  This program defines the first sprite... sprite 0... as a solid white
  square on the screen. Here's a line-by-line explanation of the program:

    LINE 10 clears the screen.

    LINE 20 sets the "sprite pointer" to where the Commodore 64 will read
  its sprite data from. Sprite 0 is set at 2040, sprite 1 at 2041, sprite
  2 at 2042, and so on up to sprite 7 at 2047. You can set all 8 sprite
  pointers to 13 by using this line in place of line 20:

    20 FOR SP=2040TO2047:POKE SP,13:NEXT SP

    LINE 30 puts the first sprite (sprite 0) into 63 bytes of the Commodore
  64's RAM memory starting at location 832 (each sprite requires 63 bytes

                                                 PROGRAMMING GRAPHICS   153

  of memory). The first sprite (sprite 0) is "addressed" at memory
  locations 832 to 894.

    LINE 40 sets the variable "V" equal to 53248, the starting address of
  the VIDEO CHIP. This entry lets us use the form (V+number) for sprite
  settings. 're using the form (V+number) when POKEing sprite settings
  because this format conserves memory and lets us work with smaller
  numbers. For example, in line 50 we typed POKE V+21. This is the same as
  typing POKE 53248+21 or POKE 53269... but V+21 requires less space than
  53269, and is easier to remember.

    LINE 50 enables or "turns on" sprite 0. There are 8 sprites, numbered
  from 0 to 7. To turn on an individual sprite, or a combination of
  sprites, all you have to do is POKE V+21 followed by a number from 0
  (turn all sprites off) to 255 (turn all 8 sprites on). You can turn on
  one or more sprites by POKEing the following numbers:
  +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-------+
  |ALL ON|SPRT 0|SPRT 1|SPRT 2|SPRT 3|SPRT 4|SPRT 5|SPRT 6|SPRT 7|ALL OFF|
  |  255 |   1  |   2  |   4  |   8  |  16  |  32  |  64  |  128 |   0   |
  +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-------+

    POKE V+21,1 turns on sprite 0. POKE V+21,128 turns on sprite 7. You
  can also turn on combinations of sprites. For example, POKE V+21,129
  turns on both sprite 0 and sprite 7 by adding the two "turn on" numbers
  (1+128) together. (See SPRITEMAKING CHART, Page 176.)

    LINE 60 sets the COLOR of sprite 0. There are 16 possible sprite
  colors, numbered from 0 (black) to 15 (grey). Each sprite requires a
  different POKE to set its color, from V+39 to V+46. POKE V+39,1 colors
  sprite 0 white. POKE V+46,15 colors sprite 7 grey. (See the SPRITEMAKING
  CHART for more information.)
    When you create a sprite, as you just did, the sprite will STAY IN
  MEMORY until you POKE it off, redefine it, or turn off your computer.
  This lets you change the color, position and even shape of the sprite in
  DIRECT or IMMEDIATE mode, which is useful for editing purposes. As an
  example, RUN the program above, then type this line in DIRECT mode
  (without a line number) and hit the <RETURN> key:

    POKE V+39,8

    The sprite on the screen is now ORANGE. Try POKEing some other numbers
  from 0 to 15 to see the other sprite colors. Because you did this in

  DIRECT mode, if you RUN your program the sprite will return to its origi-
  nal color (white).

    LINE 70, determines the HORIZONTAL or "X" POSITION of the sprite on the
  screen. This number represents the location of the UPPER LEFT CORNER of
  the sprite. The farthest left horizontal (X) position which you can see
  on your television screen is position number 24, although you can move
  the sprite OFF THE SCREEN to position number 0.

    LINE 80 determines the VERTICAL or "Y" POSITION of the sprite. In this
  program, we placed the sprite at X (horizontal) position 24, and Y
  (vertical) position 100. To try another location, type this POKE in
  DIRECT mode and hit <RETURN>:

    POKE V,24:POKE V+1,50

    This places the sprite at the upper left corner of the screen. To move
  the sprite to the lower left corner, type this:

    POKE V,24:POKE V+1,229

    Each number from 832 to 895 in our sprite 0 address represents one
  block of 8 pixels, with three 8-pixel blocks in each horizontal row of
  the sprite. The loop in line 80 tells the computer to POKE 832,255 which
  makes the first 8 pixels solid . . . then POKE 833,255 to make the second
  8 pixels solid, and so on to location 894 which is the last group of 8
  pixels in the bottom right corner of the sprite. To better see how this
  works, try typing the following in DIRECT r-node, and notice that the
  second group of 8 pixels is erased:

    POKE 833,0 (to put it back type POKE 833,255 or RUN your program)

    The following line, which you can add to your program. erases the
  blocks in the MIDDLE of the sprite you created:

    90 FOR A=836 TO 891 STEP 3:POKE A,O:NEXT A

    Remember, the pixels that make up the sprite are grouped in blocks of
  eight. This line erases the 5th group of eight pixels (block 836) and
  every third block up to block 890. Try POKEing any of the other numbers
  from 832 to 894 with either a 255 to make them solid or 0 to make them
  blank.

  | Here's a helpful "crunching" tip: The program described above is      |
  | already short, but it can be made even shorter by "crunching" it      |
  | smaller. In our example we list the key sprite settings on separate   |
  | program lines so you can see what's happening in the program. In      |
  | actual practice, a good programmer would probably write this program  |
  | as a TWO LINE PROGRAM... by "crunching" it as follows:                |
  |                                                                       |

  | 20 FORS=832TO894:POKES,255:NEXT:POKEV,24:POKEV+1,100                  |

  | memory and run more efficiently, see the "crunching guide" on Page 24.|

    A sprite located here must have both its X-position (horizontal) and
    Y-position (vertical) set so it can be displayed on the screen.

  dinates.

  POSITIONING SPRITES ON THE SCREEN

    The entire display screen is divided into a grid of X and Y coordi-
  nates, like a graph. The X COORDINATE is the HORIZONTAL position across
  the screen and the Y COORDINATE is the VERTICAL position up and down (see
  Figure 3-4).
    To position any sprite on the screen, you must POKE TWO SETTINGS...
  the X position and the Y position... these tell the computer where to
  display the UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER of the sprite. Remember that a sprite
  consists of 504 individual pixels, 24 across by 21 down... so if you POKE
  a sprite onto the upper left corner of your screen, the sprite will be
  displayed as a graphic image 24 pixels ACROSS and 21 pixels DOWN starting
  at the X-Y position you defined. The sprite will be displayed based on
  the upper left corner of the entire sprite, even if you define the sprite
  using only a small part of the 24X21-pixel sprite area.
    To understand how X-Y positioning works, study the following diagram
  (Figure 3-5), which shows the X and Y numbers in relation to your display
  screen. Note that the GREY AREA in the diagram shows your television
  viewing area... the white area represents positions which are OFF your
  viewing screen...

    To display a sprite in a given location, You must POKE the X and Y
  settings for each SPRITE... remembering that every sprite has its own
  unique X POKE and Y POKE. The X and Y settings for ail 8 sprites are
  shown here:

  POKE THESE VALUES TO SET X-Y SPRITE POSITIONS

  +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+
  |      |SPRT 0 |SPRT 1 |SPRT 2 |SPRT 3 |SPRT 4 |SPRT 5 |SPRT 6 |SPRT 7  |
  +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+
  |SET X |V,X    |V+2,X  |V+4,X  |V+6,X  |V+8,X  |V+10,X |V+12,X |V+14,X  |
  |SET Y |V+1,Y  |V+3,Y  |V+5,Y  |V+7,Y  |V+9,Y  |V+11,Y |V+13,Y |V+15,Y  |
  |RIGHTX|V+16,1 |V+16,2 |V+16,4 |V+16,8 |V+16,16|V+16,32|V+16,64|V+16,128|
  +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+

    POKEING AN X POSITION: The possible values of X are 0 to 255, counting
  from left to right. Values 0 to 23 place all or part of the sprite OUT OF
  THE VIEWING AREA off the left side of the screen... values 24 to 255
  place the sprite IN THE VIEWING AREA up to the 255th position (see next
  paragraph for settings beyond the 255th X position). To place the sprite
  at one of these positions, just type the X-POSITION POKE for the sprite
  you're using. For example, to POKE sprite I at the farthest left X
  position IN THE VIEWING AREA, type: POKE V+2,24.

    X VALUES BEYOND THE 255TH POSITION: To get beyond the 255th position
  across the screen, you need to make a SECOND POKE using the numbers in
  the "RIGHT X" row of the chart (Figure 3-5). Normally, the horizontal (X)
  numbering would continue past the 255th position to 256, 257, etc., but
  because registers only contain 8 bits we must use a "second register" to
  access the RIGHT SIDE of the screen and start our X numbering over again
  at 0. So to get beyond X position 255, you must POKE V+16 and a number
  (depending on the sprite). This gives you 65 additional X positions
  (renumbered from 0 to 65) in the viewing area on the RIGHT side of the
  viewing screen. (You can actually POKE the right side X value as high as
  255, which takes you off the right edge of the viewing screen.)

    POKEING A Y POSITION: The possible values of Y are 0 to 255, counting
  from top to bottom. Values 0 to 49 place all or part of the sprite OUT
  OF THE VIEWING AREA off the TOP of the screen. Values 50 to 229 place the
  sprite IN THE VIEWING AREA. Values 230 to 255 place all or part of the
  sprite OUT OF THE VIEWING AREA off the BOTTOM of the screen.
