  RETURN

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: RETURN

    Action: The RETURN statement is used to exit from a subroutine called
  for by a GOSUB statement. RETURN restarts the rest of your program at
  the next executable statement following the GOSUB. If you are nesting
  subroutines, each GOSUB must be paired with at least one RETURN
  statement. A subroutine can contain any number of RETURN statements,
  but the first one encountered will exit the subroutine.

  EXAMPLE of RETURN Statement:

    10 PRINT"THIS IS THE PROGRAM"
    20 GOSUB 1000
    30 PRINT"PROGRAM CONTINUES"
    40 GOSUB 1000
    50 PRINT"MORE PROGRAM"
    60 END
    1000 PRINT"THIS IS THE GOSUB":RETURN


  RIGHT$

  TYPE: String Function
  FORMAT: RIGHT$ (<string>,<numeric>)

    Action: The RIGHT$ function returns a sub-string taken from the right-
  most end of the <string> argument. The length of the sub-string is
  defined by the <numeric> argument which can be any integer in the range
  of 0 to 255. If the value of the numeric expression is zero, then a null
  string ("") is returned. If the value you give in the <numeric> argument
  is greater than the length of the <string> then the entire string is
  returned.

  EXAMPLE of RIGHT$ Function:

    10 MSG$="COMMODORE COMPUTERS"
    20 PRINT RIGHT$(MSG$,9)

  RND

  TYPE: Floating-Point Function
  FORMAT: RND (<numeric>)

    Action: RND creates a floating-point random from 0.0 to 1.0. The
  computer generates a sequence of random numbers by performing cal-
  culations on a starting number, which in computer jargon is called a
  seed. The RND function is seeded on system power-up. The <numeric>
  argument is a dummy, except for its sign (positive, zero, or negative).
    If the <numeric> argument is positive, the same "pseudorandom"
  sequence of numbers is returned, starting from a given seed value. Dif-
  ferent number sequences will result from different seeds, but any se-
  quence is repeatable by starting from the same seed number. Having a
  known sequence of "random" numbers is useful in testing programs.
    If you choose a <numeric> argument of zero, then RND generates a
  number directly from a free-running hardware clock (the system "jiffy
  clock"). Negative arguments cause the RND function to be re-seeded
  with each function call.


  EXAMPLES of RND Function:

    220 PRINT INT(RND(0)*50)               (Return random integers 0-49)

    100 X=INT(RND(1)*6)+INT(RND(1)*6)+2    (Simulates 2 dice)

    100 X=INT(RND(1)*1000)+1               (Random integers from 1-1000)

    100 X=INT(RND(1)*150)+100              (Random numbers from 100-249)

    100 X=RND(1)*(U-L)+L                   (Random numbers between
                                            upper (U) and lower (L) limits)

  RUN

  TYPE: Command
  FORMAT: RUN [<line-number>]

    Action: The system command RUN is used to start the program currently
  in memory. The RUN command causes an implied CLR operation to be
  performed before starting the program. You can avoid the CLeaRing
  operation by using CONT or GOTO to restart a program instead of RUN. If
  a <line-number> is specified, your program will start on that line.
  Otherwise, the RUN command starts at first line of the program. The RUN
  command can also be used within a program. If the <line-number> you
  specify doesn't exist, the BASIC error message UNDEF'D STATEMENT occurs.
    A RUNning program stops and BASIC returns to direct mode when an END or
  STOP statement is reached, when the last line of the program is finished,
  or when a BASIC error occurs during execution.

  EXAMPLES of RUN Command:

    RUN           (Starts at first line of program)

    RUN 500       (Starts at line-number 500)
    RUN X         (Starts at line X, or UNDEF'D STATEMENT ERROR
                   if there is no line X)


  SAVE

  TYPE: Command
  FORMAT: SAVE ["<file-name>"][,<device-number>][,<address>]

    Action: The SAVE command is used to store the program that is cur-
  rently in memory onto a tape or diskette file. The program being SAVED
  is only affected by the command while the SAVE is happening. The program
  remains in the current computer memory even after the SAVE operation is
  completed until you put something else there by using another command.
  The file type will be "prg" (program). If the <device-number> is left
  out, then the C64 will automatically assume that you want the program
  saved on cassette, device number 1. If the <device-number> is an <8>,
  then the program is written onto disk. The SAVE statement can be used

  be used in your programs and execution will continue with the next
  statement after the SAVE is completed.
    Programs on tape are automatically stored twice, so that your Com-
  modore 64 can check for errors when LOADing the program back in. When
  saving programs to tape, the <file-name> and secondary <address> are
  optional. But following a SAVE with a program name in quotes ("") or
  by a string variable (---$) helps your Commodore 64 find each program
  more easily. If the file-name is left out it can NOT be LOADed by name
  later on.
    A secondary address of I will tell the KERNAL to LOAD the tape at a
  later time, with the program currently in memory instead of the normal
  2048 location. A secondary address of 2 will cause an end-of-tape marker
  to follow the program. A secondary address of 3 combines both functions.
    When saving programs onto a disk, the <file-name> must be present.


  EXAMPLES of SAVE Command.

    SAVE               (Write to tape without a name)

    SAVE"ALPHA",1      (Store on tape as file-name "alpha")

    SAVE"ALPHA",1,2    (Store "alpha" with end-of-tape marker)

    SAVE"FUN.DISK",8   (SAVES on disk (device 8 is the disk))

    SAVE A$            (Store on tape with the name A$)

    10 SAVE"HI"        (SAVEs program and then move to next program line)

    SAVE"ME",1,3       (Stores at same memory location and puts an
                        end-of-tope marker on)

  SGN

  TYPE: Integer Function
  FORMAT: SGN (<numeric>)

    Action: SGN gives you an integer value depending upon the sign of the
  <numeric> argument. If the argument is positive the result is 1, if zero
  the result is also 0, if negative the result is -1.

  EXAMPLE of SGN Function:

    90 ON SGN(DV)+2 GOTO 100, 200, 300
    (jump to 100 if DV=negative, 200 if DV=0, 300 if DV=positive)


  SIN

  TYPE: Floating-Point Function
  FORMAT: SIN (<numeric>)

    Action: SIN gives you the sine of the <numeric> argument, in radians.
  The value of COS(X) is equal to SIN(x+3.14159265/2).

  EXAMPLE of SIN Function:

    235 AA=SIN(1.5):PRINT AA
     .997494987


  SPC

  TYPE: String Function
  FORMAT: SPC (<numeric>)

    Action: The SPC function is used to control the formatting of data, as
  either an output to the screen or into a logical file. The number of
  SPaCes given by the <numeric> argument are printed, starting at the first
  available position. For screen or tape files the value of the argument
  is in the range of 0 to 255 and for disk files up to 254. For printer
  files, an automatic carriage-return and line-feed will be performed by
  the printer if a SPaCe is printed in the last character position of a
  line. No SPaCes are printed on the following line.

  EXAMPLE of SPC Function:

    10 PRINT"RIGHT "; "HERE &";
    20 PRINT SPC(5)"OVER" SPC(14)"THERE"
    RUN

    RIGHT HERE &     OVER              THERE


  SQR

  TYPE: Floating-Point Function
  FORMAT: SQR (<numeric>)

    Action: SQR gives you the value of the SQuare Root of the <numeric>
  argument. The value of the argument must not be negative, or the BASIC
  error message ?ILLEGAL QUANTITY will happen.

  EXAMPLE of SQR Function:

    FOR J = 2 TO 5: PRINT J*S, SQR(J*5): NEXT

    10   3.16227766
    15   3.87298335
    20   4.47213595

    READY



  STATUS

  TYPE: Integer Function
  FORMAT: STATUS

    Action: Returns a completion STATUS for the last input/output operation
  which was performed on an open file. The STATUS can be read from any
  peripheral device. The STATUS (or simply ST) keyword is a system defined
