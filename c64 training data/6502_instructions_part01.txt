          *    16-bit address words are little endian, lo(w)-byte first, followed by the hi(gh)-byte.
               (An assembler will use a human readable, big-endian notation as in $HHLL.)
          **   The available 16-bit address space is conceived as consisting of pages of 256 bytes each, with
               address hi-bytes represententing the page index. An increment with carry may affect the hi-byte
               and may thus result in a crossing of page boundaries, adding an extra cycle to the execution.
               Increments without carry do not affect the hi-byte of an address and no page transitions do occur.
               Generally, increments of 16-bit addresses include a carry, increments of zeropage addresses don't.
               Notably this is not related in any way to the state of the carry flag in the status register.
          ***  Branch offsets are signed 8-bit values, -128 ... +127, negative offsets in two's complement.
               Page transitions may occur and add an extra cycle to the exucution.
