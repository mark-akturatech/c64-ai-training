          As a final observation, the two highly unstable instructions "ANE" (XAA) and
          "LXA" (LAX immediate) involving a "magic constant" are both combinations of
          an accumulator operation and an inter-register transfer between the
          accumulator and the X register:
            $8B (a=5, c=3, b=2): ANE # = STA # (NOP) + TXA
            (A OR CONST) AND X AND oper -> A
            $AB (a=4, c=3, b=2): LXA # = LDA # + TAX
            (A OR CONST) AND oper -> A -> X
          In the case of ANE, the contents of the accumulator is put on the internal
          data lines at the same time as the contents of the X-register, while there's
          also the operand read for the immediate operation, with the result
          transferred to the accumulator.
          In the case of LXA, the immediate operand and the contents of the accumulator
          are competing for the imput lines, while the result will be transferred to
          both the accumulator and the X register.
          The outcome of these competing, noisy conditions depends on the production
          series of the chip, and maybe even on environmental conditions. This effects
          in an OR-ing of the accumulator with the "magic constant" combined with an
          AND-ing of the competing inputs. The final transfer to the target register(s)
          then seems to work as may be expected.
          (This AND-ing of competing values susggests that the 6502 is working internally
          in active negative logic, where all data lines are first set to high and then
          cleared for any zero bits. This also suggests that the "magic constant" stands
          merely for a partial transfer of the contents of the accumulator.)
                                                                   6502 Instruction Set
          Much of this also applies to "TAS" (XAS, SHS), $9B, but here the extra cycles
          for indexed addressing seem to contribute to the conflict being resolved
          without this "magic constant". However, TAS is still unstable.
          Simlarly the peculiar group involving the high-byte of the provided address + 1
          (as in "H+1") — SHA (AHX, AXA), SHX (A11, SXA, XAS), SHY (A11, SYA, SAY) —
          involves a conflict of an attempt to store the accumulator and another register
          being put on the data lines at the same time, and the operations required to
          determine the target address for for indexed addressing. Again, the competing
          values are AND-ed and the instructions are unstable.
          We may also observe that SHY is really the unimplemented instruction "STY abs,X"
          and SHX is "STX abs,Y" with SHA being the combination of "LDA abs,X" and SHX.
          We may conclude that these "illegal opcodes" or "undocumented instructions" are
          really a text-book example of undefined behavior for undefined input patterns.
          Generally speaking, for any instructions xxxxxx11 (c=3) both instructions at
          xxxxxx01 (c=1) and xxxxxx10 (c=2) are started in a thread, with competing ouput
          values on the internal data lines AND-ed. For some combinations, this results
          in a fragile race condition, while others are showing mostly stable behavior.
          The addressing mode is generally determined by that of the instruction at c=1.
          (It may be interesting that is doesn't matter, if any of the two threads jams,
          as long as the timing for the other thread resolves. So there is no "JAM"
          instruction at c=3.)
