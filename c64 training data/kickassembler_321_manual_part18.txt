# KickAssembler - Testing: Assert Expressions and Code

   start:
            inc $d020
            :break()
            jmp start
When running VICE with the breakpoint file (use the -moncommands switch), VICE will run until
the break and then exit to the monitor.
Here is a list of the functions on a file value:
Attribute/Function Description
writeln(text)            Writes the ‘text’ to the file and insert a line shift.
writeln()                Insert a line shift
9.9 Passing Command Line Arguments to the Script
From the command line you can assign string values to variables which can be read from the script.
This is done with the ‘:’ notation like this;
   java -jar KickAss.jar mySource.asm :x=27 :sound=true :title=”Beta 2”
The three variables x, sound and beta2 and their string values will now be placed in a hashtable that
can be accessed by the global variable cmdLineVars:
                                                                                                   49
  .print “version =” + cmdLineVars.get(“version”)
  .var x= cmdLineVars.get(“x”).asNumber()
  .var y= 2*x
  .var sound = cmdLineVars.get(”sound”).asBoolean()
  .if (sound) jsr $1000
9.10 Making 3D Calculations
To make it easy to calculate vector data, such as coordinates for a vector object or a pre calculated
vector animation, Kick Assembler supports vector and matrix values.
Vector values are used to hold 3D vectors. They are created by the Vector function that takes x, y
and z as argument:
  .var v1 = Vector(1,2,3)
  .var v2 = Vector(0,0,2)
You can access the coordinates of the vector by its get functions and do the most common vector
operations by the assigned functions. Here are some examples:
  .var v1PlusV2 = v1+v2
  .print ”V1 scaled by 10 is ” +            [v1*10]
  .var dotProduct = v1*v2
Here is a list of vector functions and operators:
Function/Operator Example                                Decription
get(n)                                                   Returns the n’th coordinate (x=0, y=1, z=2)
getX()                                                   Returns the x coordinate
getY()                                                   Returns the y coordinate
getZ()                                                   Returns the z coordinate
+                        Vector(1,2,3)+Vector(2,3,4)     Returns the sum of two vectors
-                        Vector(1,2,3)-Vector(2,3,4)     Returns the result of a subtraction between
                                                         the two vectors
* Number                 Vector(1,2,3)* 4.2              Return the vector scaled by a number
* Vector                 Vector(1,2,3)*Vector(2,3,4)     Returns the dot product
/                        Vector(1,2,3)/2                 Divides each coordinate by a factor and
                                                         returns the result
X(v)                     Vector(0,1,0).X(Vector(1,0,0)) Returns the cross product between two
                                                         vectors
The matrix value represents a 4x4 matrix. You create it by using the Matrix function, or one of the
other constructor functions described later. You access the entries of the matrix by using its get and
set functions:
  .var matrix = Matrix()                   // Creates an identity matrix
