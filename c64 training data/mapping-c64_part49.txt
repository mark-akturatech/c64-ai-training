To make it easy to know exactly what to type when entering one of
these programs into your computer, we have established the following
listing conventions.

Generally, Commodore 64 program listings will contain words within
braces which spell out any special characters:  {DOWN} would mean to
press the cursor down key.  {5 SPACES} would mean to press the space
bar five times.

To indicate that a key should be shifted (hold down the SHIFT key
while pressing the other key), the key would be unterlined in our
listings.  For example, _S_ would mean to type the S key while holding
the SHIFT key.  This would appear on your screen as a heart symbol.
If you find an underlined key enclosed in braces (e.g., {10 _N_}), you
should type the key as many times as indicated (in our example, you
would enter ten shifted N's).

If a key is enclosed in special brackets, [<>], you should hold down
the Commodore key while pressing the key inside the special brackets.
(The Commodore key is the key in the lower-left corner of the
keyboard.)  Again, if the key is preceded by a number, you should
press the key as many times as necessary.

Rarely, you'll see a solitary letter of the alphabet enclosed in
braces.  These characters can be entered by holding down the CTRL key
while typing the letter in the braces.  For example, {A} would
indicate that you should press CTRL-A.

About the quote mode:  You know that you can move the cursor around
the screen with the CRSR keys.  Sometimes a programmer will want to
move the cursor under program control.  That's why you see all the
{LEFT}'s, {HOME}'s, and {BLU}'s in our programs.  The only way the
computer can tell the difference between direct and programmed cursor
control is the quote mode.

Once you press the quote (the double quote, SHIFT-2), you are in the
quote mode.  If you type something and then try to change it by moving
the cursor left, you'll only get a bunch of reverse-video lines.
These are the symbols for cursor left.  The only editing key that
isn't programmable is the DEL key; you can still use DEL to back up
and edit the line.  Once you type another quote, you are out of quote
mode.

You also go into quote mode when you INSerT spaces into a line.  In
any case, the easiest way to get out of quote mode is to just press
RETURN.  You'll then be out of quote mode and you can cursor up to the
mistyped line and fix it.

Use the following table when entering cursor and color control keys:
