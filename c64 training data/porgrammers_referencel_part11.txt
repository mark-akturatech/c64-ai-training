# C64 PRG Chapter 2 - BASIC Keywords (ABS-CLR)

  36   BASIC LANGUAGE VOCABULARY
~


    When evaluating a number for truth or falsehood, the computer assumes
  the number is true as long as its value isn't 0. When evaluating a
  comparison, it assigns a value of -I if the result is true, while false
  has a value of 0. In binary format, -1 is all 1's and 0 is all 0's.
  Therefore, when ANDing true/false evaluations, the result will be true if
  any bits in the result are true.

  EXAMPLES of Using AND with True/False Evaluations:

    50 IF X=7 AND W=3 THEN GOTO 10: REM ONLY TRUE IF BOTH X=7
       AND W=3 ARE TRUE
    60 IF A AND Q=7 THEN GOTO 10: REM TRUE IF A IS NON-ZERO
       AND Q=7 IS TRUE


   ASC

  TYPE: Function-Numeric
  FORMAT: ASC(<string>)

    Action: ASC will return a number from 0 to 255 which corresponds to
  the Commodore ASCII value of the first character in the string. The table
  of Commodore ASCII values is shown in Appendix C.

  EXAMPLES OF ASC Function:

    10 PRINT ASC("Z")
    20 X = ASC("ZEBRA")
    30 J = ASC(J$)

    If there are no characters in the string, an ?ILLEGAL QUANTITY error
  results. In the third example above, if J$="", the ASC function will not
  work. The GET and GET# statement read a CHR$(0) as a null string. To
  eliminate this problem, you should add a CHR$(0) to the end of the
  string as shown below.

  EXAMPLE of ASC Function Avoiding ILLEGAL QUANTITY ERROR:

    30 J = ASC(J$ + CHR$(0))

  ATN

  TYPE: Function-Numeric
  FORMAT: ATN(<number>)

    Action: This mathematical function returns the arctangent of the
  number. The result is the angle (in radians) whose tangent is the number
  given. The result is always in the range -pi/2 to +pi/2.

  EXAMPLES of ATN Function:

    10 PRINT ATN(0)
    20 X = ATN(J)*180/ {pi} : REM CONVERT TO DEGREES


  CHR$

  TYPE: Function-String
  FORMAT: CHR$ (<number>)

    Action: This function converts a Commodore ASCII code to its character
  equivalent. See Appendix C for a list of characters and their codes. The
  number must have a value between 0 and 255, or an ?ILLEGAL QUANTITY error
  message results.

  EXAMPLES of CHR$ Function:

    10 PRINT CHR$(65) : REM 65 = UPPER CASE A
    20 A$=CHR$(13) : REM 13 = RETURN KEY
    50 A=ASC(A$) : A$ = CHR$(A) : REM CONVERTS TO C64 ASCII CODE AND BACK

  CLOSE

  TYPE: I/O Statement
  FORMAT: CLOSE <file number>

    Action: This statement shuts off any data file or channel to a device.
  The file number is the same as when the file or device was OPENed (see
  OPEN statement and the section on INPUT/OUTPUT programming).
    When working with storage devices like cassette tape and disks, the
  CLOSE operation stores any incomplete buffers to the device. When this
  is not performed, the file will be incomplete on the tape and unreadable
  on the disk. The CLOSE operation isn't as necessary with other devices,
  but it does free up memory for other files. See your external device
  manual for more details.

  EXAMPLES of CLOSE Statement:

    10 CLOSE 1
    20 CLOSE X
    30 CLOSE 9*(1+J)


  CLR

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: CLR

    Action: This statement makes available RAM memory that had been used
  but is no longer needed. Any BASIC program in memory is untouched, but
  all variables, arrays, GOSUB addresses, FOR...NEXT loops, user-defined
  functions, and files are erased from memory, and their space is mode
  available to new variables, etc.

~


    In the case of files to the disk and cassette tape, they are not
  properly CLOSED by the CLR statement. The information about the files is
  lost to the computer, including any incomplete buffers. The disk drive
  will still think the file is OPEN. See the CLOSE statement for more
  information on this.

  EXAMPLE of CLR Statement:


    10 X=25
    20 CLR
    30 PRINT X

    RUN
    0

    READY






  CMD


  TYPE: I/O Statement
  FORMAT: <file number> [,string]

    Action: This statement switches the primary- output device from the TV
  screen to the file specified. This file could be on disk, tape, printer,
  or an I/O device like the modem. The file number must be specified in a
  prior OPEN statement. The string, when specified, is sent to the file.
  This is handy for titling printouts, etc.
    When this command is in effect, any PRINT statements and LIST commands
  will not display on the screen, but will send the text in the same
  format to the file.
    To re-direct the output back to the screen, the PRINT# command should
  send a blank line to the CMD device before CLOSEing, so it will
  stop expecting data (called "un-listening" the device).

    Any system error (like ?SYNTAX ERROR) will cause output to return to
  the screen. Devices aren't un-listened by this, so you should send a
  blank line after an error condition. (See your printer or disk manual for
  more details.)

  EXAMPLES of CMD Statement:

    OPEN 4,4: CMD 4,"TITLE" : LIST: REM LISTS PROGRAM ON PRINTER
    PRINT#4: CLOSE 4: REM UN-LISTENS AND CLOSES PRINTER

    10 OPEN 1,1,1,"TEST" : REM CREATE SEQ FILE
    20 CMD 1 : REM OUTPUT TO TAPE FILE, NOT SCREEN
    30 FOR L = 1 TO 100
    40 PRINT L: REM PUTS NUMBER IN TAPE BUFFER
    50 NEXT
    60 PRINT#1 : REM UNLISTEN
    70 CLOSE 1 : REM WRITE UNFINISHED BUFFER, PROPERLY FINISH


  CONT

  TYPE: Command
  FORMAT: CONT

    Action: This command re-starts the execution of a program which was
  halted by a STOP or END statement or the <RUN/STOP> key being pressed.
  The program will re-start at the exact place from which it left off.
    While the program is stopped, the user can inspect or change any
  variables or look at the program. When debugging or examining a program,
  STOP statements can be placed at strategic locations to allow examination
  of variables and to check the flow of the program.
    The error message CAN'T CONTINUE will result from editing the program
  (even just hitting <RETURN> with the cursor on an unchanged line), or if
  the program halted due to an error, or if you caused an error before
  typing CONT to re-start the program.

  EXAMPLE of CONT Command:

    10 PI=0:C=1
    20 PI=PI+4/C-4/(C+2)
    30 PRINT PI
    40 C=C+4:GOTO 20

                                             BASIC LANGUAGE VOCABULARY   41

    This program calculates the value of PI. RUN this program, and after
  a short while hit the <RUN/STOP> key. You will see the display:

                 +----------------------------------+
    BREAK IN 20  | NOTE: Might be different number. |
                 +----------------------------------+

    Type the command PRINT C to see how far the Commodore 64 has gotten.
  Then use CONT to resume from where the Commodore 64 left off.


  COS

  TYPE: Function
  FORMAT: COS (<number>)

    Action: This mathematical function calculates the cosine of the number,
  where the number is an angle in radians.

  EXAMPLES of COS Function:

    10 PRINT COS(0)
    20 X = COS(Y* {pi} /180) : REM CONVERT DEGREES TO RADIANS


  DATA

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: DATA <list of constants>

    Action: DATA statements store information within a program. The program
  uses the information by means of the READ statement, which pulls
  successive constants from the DATA statements.
    The DATA statements don't have to be executed by the program, they
  only have to be present. Therefore, they are usually placed at the end of
  the program.
    All data statements in a program are treated as a continuous list. Data
  is READ from left to right, from the lowest numbered line to the highest.
  If the READ statement encounters data that doesn't fit the type requested
  (if it needs a number and finds a string) an error message occurs.
