  10   BASIC PROGRAMMING RULES
~


    EXAMPLES:
                     2+2
                     A+B+C
                     X%+1
                     BR+10E-2

    SUBTRACTION (-): The minus sign (-) specifies that the operand on the
  right is subtracted from the operand on the left.

    EXAMPLES:
                     4-1
                     100-64
                     A-B
                     55-142

    The minus can also be used as a unary minus. That means that it is the
  minus sign in front of a negative number. This is equal to subtracting
  the number from zero (0).

    EXAMPLES:
                     -5
                     -9E4
                     -B
                     4-(-2) same as 4+2

    MULTIPLICATION (*): An asterisk (*) specifies that the operand on the
  left is multiplied by the operand on the right.

    EXAMPLES:
                     100*2
                     50*0
                     A*X1
                     R%*14

    DIVISION (/): The slash (/) specifies that the operand on the left is
  divided by the operand on the right.

    EXAMPLES:
                     10/2
                     6400/4
                     A/B
                     4E2/XR

    EXPONENTIATION     The up arrow (^) specifies that the operand on the
  left is raised to the power specified by the operand on the right (the
  exponent). If the operand on the right is a 2, the number on the left is
  squared; if the exponent is a 3, the number on the left is cubed, etc.
  The exponent can be any number so long as the result of the operation
  gives a valid floating-point number.

    EXAMPLES:
                     2^2        Equivalent to: 2*2
                     3^3        Equivalent to: 3*3*3
                     4^4        Equivalent to: 4*4*4*4
                     AB^CD
                     3^-2       Equivalent to: 1/3*1/3

  RELATIONAL OPERATORS

    The relational operators (<, =, >, <=, >=, <>) are primarily used
  to compare the values of two operands, but they also produce an arith-
  metic result. The relational operators and the logical operators (AND,
  OR, and NOT), when used in comparisons, actually produce an arithmetic
  true/false evaluation of an expression. If the relationship stated in
  the expression is true the result is assigned an integer value of - 1
  and if it's false a value of 0 is assigned. These are the relational
  operators:
                   <   LESS THAN
                   =   EQUAL TO
                   >   GREATER THAN
                   <=  LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO
                   >=  GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO
                   <>  NOT EQUAL TO

    EXAMPLES:

      1 =5-4          result true (-1)
      14>66           result false (0)
      15>=15          result true (-1)

    Relational operators can be used to compare strings. For comparison
  purposes, the letters of the alphabet have the order A<B<C<D, etc.
  Strings are compared by evaluating the relationship between corre-
  sponding characters from left to right (see String Operations).

    EXAMPLES:

      "A" < "B"       result true (-1)
      "X" = "YY"      result false (0)
      BB$ <> CC$

    Numeric data items can only be compared (or assigned) to other numeric
  items. The same is true when comparing strings, otherwise the BASIC error
  message ?TYPE MISMATCH will occur. Numeric operands are compared by first
  converting the values of either or both operands from integer to
  floating-point form, as necessary. Then the relationship of the floating-
  point values is evaluated to give a true/false result.
    At the end of all comparisons, you get an integer no matter what data
  type the operand is (even if both are strings). Because of this,
  a comparison of two operands can be used as an operand in performing
  calculations. The result will be - 1 or 0 and can be used as anything but
  a divisor, since division by zero is illegal.

  LOGICAL OPERATORS

    The logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) can be used to modify the meanings
  of the relational operators or to produce an arithmetic result. Logical
  operators can produce results other than -1 and 0, though any nonzero
  result is considered true when testing for a true/false condition.
    The logical operators (sometimes called Boolean operators) can also be
  used to perform logic operations on individual binary digits (bits) in
  two operands. But when you're using the NOT operator, the operation is
  performed only on the single operand to the right. The operands must be
  in the integer range of values (-32768 to +32767) (floating-point
  numbers are converted to integers) and logical operations give an integer
  result.
    Logical operations are performed bit-by-corresponding-bit on the two
  operands. The logical AND produces a bit result of 1 only if both operand
  bits are 1. The logical OR produces a bit result of I if either operand
  bit is 1. The logical NOT is the opposite value of each bit as a single
  operand. In other words, it's really saying, "if it's NOT 1 then it is 0.
  If it's NOT 0 then it is 1."
    The exclusive OR (XOR) doesn't have a logical operator but it is per-
  formed as part of the WAIT statement. Exclusive OR means that if the bits
  of two operands are equal then the result is 0 otherwise the result is 1.
    Logical operations are defined by groups of statements which, taken
  together, constitute a Boolean "truth table" as shown in Table 1-2.

  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

    The logical operators AND, OR and NOT specify a Boolean arithmetic
  operation to be performed on the two operand expressions on either side
  of the operator. In the case of NOT, ONLY the operand on the RIGHT is
  considered. Logical operations (or Boolean arithmetic) aren't performed
  until all arithmetic and relational operations in an expression have been
  completed.

    EXAMPLES:

    IF A=100 AND B=100 THEN 10    (if both A and B have a value
                                   of 100 then the result is true)

    A=96 AND 32: PRINT A          (A = 32)
