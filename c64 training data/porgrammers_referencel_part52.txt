  B-4. Function Name: CHRIN

    Purpose: Get a character from the input channel
    Call address: $FFCF (hex) 65487 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A
    Preparatory routines: (OPEN, CHKIN)
    Error returns: 0 (See READST)
    Stack requirements: 7+
    Registers affected: A, X

    Description: This routine gets a byte of data from a channel already
  set up as the input channel by the KERNAL routine CHKIN. If the CHKIN has
  NOT been used to define another input channel, then all your data is
  expected from the keyboard. The data byte is returned in the accumulator.
  The channel remains open after the call.
    Input from the keyboard is handled in a special way. First, the cursor
  is turned on, and blinks until a carriage return is typed on the
  keyboard. All characters on the line (up to 88 characters) are stored in
  the BASIC input buffer. These characters can be retrieved one at a time
  by calling this routine once for each character. When the carriage return
  is retrieved, the entire line has been processed. The next time this
  routine is called, the whole process begins again, i.e., by flashing the
  cursor.

  How to Use:

  FROM THE KEYBOARD

    1) Retrieve a byte of data by calling this routine.
    2) Store the data byte.
    3) Check if it is the last data byte (is it a CR?)
    4) If not, go to step 1.

  EXAMPLE:

       LDY $#00      ;PREPARE THE Y REGISTER TO STORE THE DATA
   RD  JSR CHRIN
       STA DATA,Y    ;STORE THE YTH DATA BYTE IN THE YTH
                     ;LOCATION IN THE DATA AREA.
       INY
       CMP #CR       ;IS IT A CARRIAGE RETURN?
       BNE RD        ;NO, GET ANOTHER DATA BYTE

  EXAMPLE:

    JSR CHRIN
    STA DATA

  FROM OTHER DEVICES

    0) Use the KERNAL OPEN and CHKIN routines.
    1) Call this routine (using a JSR instruction).
    2) Store the data.

  EXAMPLE:

    JSR CHRIN
    STA DATA


  B-5. Function Name: CHROUT

    Purpose: Output a character
    Call address: $FFD2 (hex) 65490 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A
    Preparatory routines: (CHKOUT,OPEN)
    Error returns: 0 (See READST)
    Stack requirements: 8+
    Registers affected: A

    Description: This routine outputs a character to an already opened
  channel. Use the KERNAL OPEN and CHKOUT routines to set up the output
  channel before calling this routine, If this call is omitted, data is
  sent to the default output device (number 3, the screen). The data byte
  to be output is loaded into the accumulator, and this routine is called.
  The data is then sent to the specified output device. The channel is left
  open after the call.

  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | NOTE: Care must be taken when using this routine to send data to a    |
  | specific serial device since data will be sent to all open output     |
  | channels on the bus. Unless this is desired, all open output channels |
  | on the serial bus other than the intended destination channel must be |
  | closed by a call to the KERNAL CLRCHN routine.                        |
  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

  How to Use:

    0) Use the CHKOUT KERNAL routine if needed, (see description above).
    1) Load the data to be output into the accumulator.
    2) Call this routine.

  EXAMPLE:

    ;DUPLICATE THE BASIC INSTRUCTION CMD 4,"A";
    LDX #4          ;LOGICAL FILE #4
    JSR CHKOUT      ;OPEN CHANNEL OUT
    LDA #'A
    JSR CHROUT      ;SEND CHARACTER


  B-6. Function Name: CIOUT

    Purpose: Transmit a byte over the serial bus
    Call address: $FFA8 (hex) 65448 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A
    Preparatory routines: LISTEN, [SECOND]
    Error returns: See READST
    Stack requirements: 5
    Registers affected: None

    Description: This routine is used to send information to devices on the
  serial bus. A call to this routine will put a data byte onto the serial
  bus using full serial handshaking. Before this routine is called, the
  LISTEN KERNAL routine must be used to command a device on the serial bus
  to get ready to receive data. (If a device needs a secondary address, it
  must also be sent by using the SECOND KERNAL routine.) The accumulator is
  loaded with a byte to handshake as data on the serial bus. A device must
  be listening or the status word will return a timeout. This routine
  always buffers one character. (The routine holds the previous character
  to be sent back.) So when a call to the KERNAL UNLSN routine is made to
  end the data transmission, the buffered character is sent with an End Or
  Identify (EOI) set. Then the UNLSN command is sent to the device.

  How to Use:

    0) Use the LISTEN KERNAL routine (and the SECOND routine if needed).
    1) Load the accumulator with a byte of data.
    2) Call this routine to send the data byte.

  EXAMPLE:


    LDA #'X       ;SEND AN X TO THE SERIAL BUS
    JSR CIOUT


  B-7. Function Name: CINT

    Purpose: Initialize screen editor & 6567 video chip
    Call address: $FF81 (hex) 65409 (decimal)
    Communication registers: None
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns: None
    Stack requirements: 4
    Registers affected: A, X, Y


    Description: This routine sets up the 6567 video controller chip in the
  Commodore 64 for normal operation. The KERNAL screen editor is also
  initialized. This routine should be called by a Commodore 64 program
  cartridge.

  How to Use:

    1) Call this routine.

  EXAMPLE:

    JSR CINT
    JMP RUN       ;BEGIN EXECUTION

  B-8. Function Name: CLALL

    Purpose: Close all files
    Call address: $FFE7 (hex) 65511 (decimal)
    Communication registers: None
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns: None
    Stack requirements: 11
    Registers affected: A, X

    Description: This routine closes all open files. When this routine is
  called, the pointers into the open file table are reset, closing all
  files. Also, the CLRCHN routine is automatically called to reset the I/O
  channels.

  How to Use:

    1) Call this routine.

  EXAMPLE:

    JSR CLALL   ;CLOSE ALL FILES AND SELECT DEFAULT I/O CHANNELS
    JMP RUN     ;BEGIN EXECUTION


  B-9. Function Name: CLOSE

    Purpose: Close a logical file
    Call address: $FFC3 (hex) 65475 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns: 0,240 (See READST)
    Stack requirements: 2+
    Registers affected: A, X, Y

    Description: This routine is used to close a logical file after all I/O
  operations have been completed on that file. This routine is called after
  the accumulator is loaded with the logical file number to be closed (the
  same number used when the file was opened using the OPEN routine).




                                            BASIC TO MACHINE LANGUAGE   281

  How to Use:

    1) Load the accumulator with the number of the logical file to be
       closed.
    2) Call this routine.

  EXAMPLE:

    ;CLOSE 15
    LDA #15
    JSR CLOSE

  B-10. Function Name: CLRCHN

    Purpose: Clear I/O channels
    Call address: $FFCC (hex) 65484 (decimal)
    Communication registers: None
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns:
    Stack requirements: 9
    Registers affected: A, X

    Description: This routine is called to clear all open channels and re-
  store the I/O channels to their original default values. It is usually
  called after opening other I/O channels (like a tape or disk drive) and
  using them for input/output operations. The default input device is 0
  (keyboard). The default output device is 3 (the Commodore 64 screen).
    If one of the channels to be closed is to the serial port, an UNTALK
  signal is sent first to clear the input channel or an UNLISTEN is sent to
  clear the output channel. By not calling this routine (and leaving lis-
  tener(s) active on the serial bus) several devices can receive the same
  data from the Commodore 64 at the same time. One way to take advantage
  of this would be to command the printer to TALK and the disk to LISTEN.
  This would allow direct printing of a disk file.
    This routine is automatically called when the KERNAL CLALL routine is
  executed.

  How to Use:
    1) Call this routine using the JSR instruction.

  EXAMPLE:
    JSR CLRCHN
