# Noters (Release-Notes Utilities)

**Summary:** Noters are small C-64 utilities for creating and displaying release notes or contact messages; choose a custom noter per release for style or a generic noter for small/quick releases — any noter must be able to display text.

## What Noters Are
Noters are compact programs used to present release notes, credits, or contact information on the Commodore 64. Their sole functional requirement is reliable text display (screen printing/scrolling). They are not full demos or editors—just lightweight presentation utilities.

## When to Use a Custom Noter vs a Generic Noter
- Custom noter per release: preferred for style and identity (author’s opinion); allows tailored formatting, artwork, and messaging for each release.
- Generic noter: suitable for small, frequent, or throwaway releases where creating a bespoke noter is disproportionate to the effort; reuse a standard template.
- Practical rule: the choice is immaterial from a technical standpoint so long as the program displays the required text clearly.
