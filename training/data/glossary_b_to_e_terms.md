# MACHINE — Glossary (B–E)

**Summary:** Glossary entries for machine/assembly concepts B–E including assembly language, binary, bit, bootstrap, breakpoint, bug, bus, byte, calling point, channel, comment, commutative, control bus, data bus, debugging, decimal, decrement, descriptor, disassembler, dynamic string, effective address, event flag, and execute — useful searchable terms for assembler, memory, and I/O concepts.

## Definitions (B–E)
- Assembly language: (1) The set of instructions, or language, in which a source program must be written before assembly.
- Binary: (1) Something that has two possible states; a number based on digits, each of which has two possible states.
- Bit: (1) A binary digit; the smallest element of information within a computer.
- Bootstrap: (6) A program that starts up another program.
- Breakpoint: (8) A location where the program will stop so as to allow checking for errors.
- Bug: (8) An error within a program.
- Bus: (1) A collection of wires connecting many devices together.
- Byte: (1) Eight bits of information grouped together; the normal measure of computer storage.
- Calling point: (2) The program location from which a subroutine is called into play; the subroutine will return to the calling point when finished.
- Channel: (8) A path connecting the computer to one of its external devices.
- Comment: (8) A program element which does not cause the computer to do anything, used as advice to the human program reader.
- Commutative: (3) A mathematical operation that works both ways, e.g., 3+4 gives the same result as 4+3.
- Control bus: (1) A bus that signals timing and direction of data flow to the various connected devices.
- Data bus: (1) A bus used to transfer data between memory and the microprocessor.
- Debugging: (8) Testing a program to uncover possible errors.
- Decimal: (1) A number system based on a system of ten digits; the "normal" numbering system used by humans.
- Decrement: (2) To make smaller by a value of one.
- Descriptor: (6) A three-byte set of data giving a string's length and its location.
- Disassembler: (2) A program that changes object code into assembly code. Similar to a LIST in BASIC.
- Dynamic string: (6) A string that must be placed into memory after being calculated or received.
- Effective address: (2) The address used by the processor to handle data when executing an instruction. It may differ from the instruction address (or "operand") because of indexing or indirect addressing.
- Event flag: (7) A flag that signals that some event has happened.
- Execute: (1) To perform an instruction.
