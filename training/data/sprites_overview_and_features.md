# Sprites (VIC-II)

**Summary:** Hardware sprites handled by the VIC-II (up to 8, numbered 0–7) — user-definable 24×21 dot graphics with independent color, hi-res or multicolor modes, 2× magnification, selectable background priority, fixed sprite-sprite priority, and collision detection.

## Overview
Sprites are hardware-maintained graphics objects generated by the VIC-II. Each sprite carries its own shape, color definition, and mode (hi-resolution or multicolor), and is composited on top of whatever screen graphics mode is active (character, bitmap, multicolor, etc.). The VIC-II natively supports eight sprites simultaneously; additional visible sprites require raster techniques (raster interrupts and sprite multiplexing).

## Features
- Size: 24 horizontal × 21 vertical dots per sprite.
- Colors: Each sprite may use any of the 16 C64 colors (sprite-specific color register).
- Modes: Hi-res (1-bit per pixel) or multicolor (2 bits per pixel, shared multicolor registers).
- Memory: Sprite graphics are stored in dedicated memory pointed to by sprite pointers (see referenced chunk for layout and size).
- Magnification: 2× scaling available horizontally, vertically, or both (doubling dot size).
- Priorities:
  - Selectable sprite-to-background priority (sprite in front of or behind background).
  - Fixed sprite-to-sprite priority (hardware-defined ordering 0..7).
- Collision detection:
  - Sprite-to-sprite collision flags set by VIC-II.
  - Sprite-to-background collision flags set by VIC-II.
- Compatibility: Sprites remain visually unaffected by the underlying graphics mode (they overlay or combine according to priority settings).
