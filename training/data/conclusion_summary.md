# Multidirectional Scrolling Techniques — Conclusion (Cadaver)

**Summary:** Short conclusion about C64 multidirectional scrolling and game-world construction, referencing tradeoffs such as doublebuffering and split updates and techniques for object activation and spawning. Author expresses enthusiasm for C64 multidirectional games and personal dedication to creating them.

## Conclusion
This brief, intentionally not deeply technical rant was meant to shed light on multidirectional scrolling and building a "game world" on the C64 — tasks the author considers among the most complex in C64 game development (only full 3D is more complex). The author emphasizes a strong preference for C64 games that include these elements (when otherwise playable) and states a personal dedication to developing such multidirectional C64 games.
