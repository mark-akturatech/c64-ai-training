# Side sector #0 pointer-table dump — upper-middle portion (lines 8420–8479)

**Summary:** This section presents a fragment of a pointer-table dump from side sector #0, specifically lines 8420–8479. It includes pointer-table tokens such as OD, Ot, Or, Ofc, and Oo, along with numeric values (00, 01, 10) and various symbols. The fragment continues the columnar mapping and annotations from adjacent blocks.

**Description**

This fragment is a direct transcription of a formatted side-sector pointer-table dump. It displays a columnar listing of tokens used as pointer-table entries and annotations. Common tokens include OD, Ot, Or, Ofc, and Oo. Numeric values such as 01, 00, and 10 are also present, along with symbol fragments like '. Ofc.', 'Vu', and '. HV'. Some entries exhibit potential OCR distortions, including "i  '5", "I  ^", and "y\o". This block is part of a larger column-mapping; however, specific context such as column headers and exact boundaries are not provided in this fragment.

**Note:** The source may contain OCR errors, leading to ambiguous tokens and spacing artifacts.
