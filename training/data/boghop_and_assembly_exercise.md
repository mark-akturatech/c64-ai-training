# Introduction to the BOGHOP example (Appendix C)

**Summary:** BOGHOP (Appendix C) is a complete C64 assembly-language game example intended to demonstrate nearly all programming techniques used in this book; assemble and run the source (work on a copy of the source disk) and inspect comments to locate change points for experimentation.

## Overview
BOGHOP is presented as a full example game demonstrating the programming techniques covered in the text. The program listing and commentary in Appendix C show how small, localized changes in the source can produce significant changes to gameplay; the code is structured to make experimentation straightforward.

## How to use this example
- Make a copy of the source-code disk and work only on the copy.  
- Assemble the program (use your preferred 6502/C64 assembler) and run it on hardware or an emulator.  
- Read the inline comments in the program listing to find where small changes affect gameplay; use those locations as starting points for learning and experimentation.
