# INSTRUCTION SET - OP CODES, EXECUTION TIME, MEMORY REQUIREMENTS (Header / Missing Tables)

**Summary:** Header page for the Commodore 64 / 6502 instruction set providing placeholders for opcode tables, execution time and memory-requirement tables; includes a vendor caution about the use of undefined op codes and indicates that the opcode/timing/memory tables (graphics) are missing.

## Overview
This chunk is a header/placeholder for the instruction-set tables that should list op codes, their execution times (cycles), and memory requirements (bytes). The original source only contains the heading, a missing-graphic placeholder, and a vendor liability note; the detailed opcode tables and timing/memory tables are not present in this scan. Cross-reference pointers point to related chunks for mnemonic listings and register/flag effects.

- Purpose: reserved page for opcode tables (mnemonics ↔ opcodes), per-opcode execution time (cycles), and memory-size information.
- Present here: section heading, missing-picture placeholder, vendor cautionary note.
- Not present here: opcode matrix, timing columns, memory requirement columns, and associated graphics.
