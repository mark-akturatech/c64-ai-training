# COMMODORE 64 - Appendix P: Glossary

**Summary:** Short definitions of Commodore 64 and SID-related terms including ADSR (envelope terms), attack/decay/sustain/release, CIA, DDR, FIFO, jiffy clock, NMI, SID, VIC-II, ROM, RAM and related basic computing/math terms.

## Glossary
ADSR — Attack/Decay/Sustain/Release envelope.

attack — Rate at which musical note reaches peak volume.

binary — Base-2 number system.

Boolean operators — Logical operators.

byte — Memory location.

CHROMA noise — Color distortion.

CIA — Complex Interface Adapter.

DDR — Data Direction Register.

decay — Rate at which musical note falls from peak volume to sustain volume.

decimal — Base-10 number system.

e — Mathematical constant (approx. 2.71828183).

envelope — Shape of the volume of a note over time.

FIFO — First-In/First-Out.

hexadecimal — Base-16 number system.

integer — Whole number (without decimal point).

jiffy clock — Hardware interval timer.

NMI — Non-Maskable Interrupt.

octal — Base-8 number system.

operand — Parameter.

OS — Operating System.

pixel — Dot of resolution on the screen.

queue — Single-file line.

register — Special memory storage location.

release — Rate at which a musical note fails from sustain volume to no volume.
**[Note: Source may contain an error — "fails" likely should read "falls".]**

ROM — Read-Only Memory.

SID — Sound Interface Device.

signed numbers — Plus or minus numbers.

subscript — Index variable.

sustain — Volume level for sustain of musical note.

syntax — Programming sentence structure.

truncated — Cut off, eliminated (not rounded).

VIC-II — Video Interface Chip.

video screen — Television set
