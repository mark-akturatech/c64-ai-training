# Commodore CP/M Add-On (Cartridge)

**Summary:** Commodore offered a CP/M* add-on in the form of a cartridge, enabling compatible Commodore systems to run CP/M software.

**Description**

Commodore developed a CP/M add-on cartridge for the Commodore 64, allowing users to access a vast library of CP/M software. This cartridge contained a Z80 processor running at 1 MHz, enabling the C64 to run CP/M 2.2. However, the cartridge faced compatibility issues with later C64 board revisions due to timing differences.

The CP/M cartridge was primarily designed for the Commodore 64. It was released in the summer of 1983, approximately a year after the C64's launch. The cartridge's part number and model name are not specified in the available sources.

To use the CP/M cartridge, users would insert it into the C64's expansion port and power on the system. The cartridge would then boot into the CP/M operating system, allowing access to CP/M software. The cartridge package included CP/M 2.2 boot disks, which are still available online. ([z80.eu](https://www.z80.eu/c64.html?utm_source=openai))

The CP/M cartridge enabled the use of various CP/M software titles, including programming languages like COBOL, PL/1, ALGOL, FORTRAN, and BASIC variants such as CBASIC and MBASIC. Other software included word processors like WordStar and spreadsheets like SuperCalc. ([c64-wiki.com](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/CP/M?utm_source=openai))
