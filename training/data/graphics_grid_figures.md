# Figure captions: character-space and pixel grids (Fig. 9-1 — 9-3)

**Summary:** Captions for three figures illustrating C64 graphics layouts: standard bitmap grid with character spaces and individual pixels (Fig. 9-1), multicolor mode double-wide pixels (Fig. 9-2), and a character-space grid (Fig. 9-3). Searchable terms: character spaces, pixels, multicolor, bitmap, graphics layout.

**Figure captions / Descriptions**

- **Fig. 9-1** — A grid showing character spaces and individual pixels (standard bitmap).
- **Fig. 9-2** — A grid showing double-wide pixels for multicolor modes.
- **Fig. 9-3** — A character-space grid.
