# Commodore IEC Serial Bus Protocol — Overview and Series Structure

**Summary:** High-level index of the Commodore Peripheral Bus family (1977–1991), listing variants and document parts: IEEE-488, TALK/LISTEN arbitration layer, Commodore DOS file-system layer, Standard Serial (IEC), TCBM, JiffyDOS, Fast Serial, and CBDOS.

## Part listing and scope
The Commodore Peripheral Bus family spans 1977–1991 and is divided into document parts that correspond to bus variants and shared protocol layers:

- Part 1: IEEE-488 — PET/CBM series (1977)  
- Part 2: The TALK/LISTEN Layer — bus arbitration and addressing (shared across all variants)  
- Part 3: The Commodore DOS Layer — device-level filesystem protocol (shared across all variants)  
- Part 4: Standard Serial (IEC) — VIC-20, C64 (1981)  
- Part 5: TCBM — C16, C116, Plus/4 (1984)  
- Part 6: JiffyDOS — replacement/upgrade firmware for faster DOS (1985)  
- Part 7: Fast Serial — C128 (1986)  
- Part 8: CBDOS — C65 (1991)

## Notes
- Parts 2 (TALK/LISTEN) and 3 (Commodore DOS) are common layers reused by multiple physical/transport variants.  
- The timeline shows evolution from the IEEE-488 parallel bus toward serial and accelerated protocols (IEC, JiffyDOS, Fast Serial, CBDOS).
