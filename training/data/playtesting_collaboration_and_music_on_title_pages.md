# Design tips — Brainstorming, title music, and short animations

**Summary:** Use brainstorming sessions for creative input; add brief title-page music and short between-level animations to retain player interest; keep background music low relative to sound effects and provide a player-toggleable option.

## Design guidance
- Brainstorming (group "bull session") — Discuss game ideas with others before coding to gather diverse perspectives and creative input that can improve game appeal and play mechanics.
- Title-page music — Play a brief piece of music while title/credit/rules screens are shown to hold the player's attention during reading.
- Between-level breaks — Use short animations (often combined with music) during pauses between levels to give players a moment to relax and to add polish and variety.
- Background music balance — If background music is used during play, mix it at a relatively low volume compared to sound effects so it does not drown them out.
- Player control — Provide an option to mute or toggle background music so players can choose music-free play.
