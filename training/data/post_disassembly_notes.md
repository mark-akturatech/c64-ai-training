# Loader: transition to loader-structure and timing diagram references

**Summary:** Short transition note after disassembly marking the start of the loader-structure summary and referencing the loader-timings image; searchable terms: loader_structure, loader_timings_and_image, C64 tape loader, disassembly.

**Description**
This chunk is a brief transitional fragment found immediately after a disassembly listing. It contains:
- A heading indicating the start of "Loader-structure".
- Cross-reference pointers to more detailed chunks:
  - "loader_structure" — expands on a high-level description of the loader components.
  - "loader_timings_and_image" — contains the timing diagram and image referenced here.
- A couple of small notes and blank lines; no code, register maps, or timing data are present in this fragment.

No operational details, code, or timing diagrams are included — this chunk only marks where those materials begin elsewhere.

## References
- "loader_structure" — High-level description of the loader components.
- "loader_timings_and_image" — Timing diagram and image for the loader (referenced but not included here).
