# COMMODORE 64 Programmer's Reference Guide — Purpose & Intended Audience

**Summary:** The COMMODORE 64 Programmer's Reference Guide is a working reference for using the C64's built-in capabilities; aimed at programmers from beginning BASIC users to professionals experienced in 6502 machine language. It is a reference (not a BASIC or 6502 tutorial) and includes a glossary and semi-tutorial sections; consult the COMMODORE 64 User's Guide (Appendix N) or the Bibliography for BASIC instruction.

## Introduction
The Programmer's Reference Guide was produced as a practical, hands-on reference to maximize use of the Commodore 64 hardware and ROM functions. It collects the technical information needed to write programs ranging from simple examples to complex applications, concentrating on accurate operational details rather than introductory teaching.

## Intended audience
- Beginning BASIC programmers who already have a working knowledge of BASIC and want to extend their use of the C64 hardware.
- Intermediate and advanced programmers who need precise reference material for the system ROMs, I/O, and hardware behavior.
- Professional developers experienced in 6502 machine language looking for a concise hardware/ROM reference.

## Scope and limitations
- The book is a reference, not a comprehensive tutorial: it documents registers, routines, system behavior, and examples but does not teach BASIC or 6502 machine language from first principles.
- It contains an extensive glossary and semi-tutorial sections for many topics, but readers lacking a working knowledge of BASIC should consult the COMMODORE 64 User's Guide (or Appendix N of that guide) for BASIC instruction.
- For novices, the Guide’s usefulness depends on prior programming knowledge; some sections assume familiarity with BASIC or 6502 concepts.
