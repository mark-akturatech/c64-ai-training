# Byte (8-bit group)

**Summary:** Describes the 8-bit grouping (byte) used in the Commodore 64: 2^8 = 256 possible values, numeric range 0–255, and that the C-64 represents and transfers all data as bytes (hence an "8‑bit machine").

**Definition and value range**

Grouping N = 8 bits yields 2^N possible values. For N = 8:

- 2^8 = 256
- 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 256

A group of 8 bits is called a byte. The numeric values a byte can represent range from 0 to 255 inclusive (0 is the lowest value; 255 is the highest). Inside the Commodore 64, all data is represented and transferred as bytes; this is why the C-64 is commonly described as an "8-bit machine." A byte is the standard unit of storage and data transfer on the system.
