# KERNAL RAM: Locations 1020-1023 ($03FC-$03FF) — Four unused bytes

**Summary:** Addresses $03FC-$03FF (decimal 1020–1023) are four unused KERNAL/RAM bytes available to programs; related terms: cassette buffer, PRINT #1, GET #1, INPUT #1, identifier byte $05 (logical end-of-tape marker).

## Description
- Locations 1020–1023 ($03FC–$03FF) are four free bytes in the KERNAL area of system RAM that programs may use for temporary storage.
- The cassette subsystem stores data blocks temporarily in the cassette buffer while reading or writing; these bytes are distinct from the program-file body and are used by cassette operations.
- The actual data byte written by the BASIC PRINT #1 command (and read back by GET #1 and INPUT #1) is associated with cassette block handling and the cassette buffer mechanism.
- An identifier byte value of 5 ($05) marks a block as the logical end of tape; when the KERNAL encounters this marker it will stop searching past that point even if additional physical tape blocks exist.
