# Section 4.8: DUPLICATE command

**Summary:** DUPLICATE — legacy disk-copy command present in dual-drive OSes (e.g., 4040) used to copy entire diskettes from one drive to another; has no function on the single-drive 1541. Search terms: DUPLICATE, dual-drive, 4040, 1541, disk copy.

## Description
DUPLICATE is a legacy operating-system command originally supplied on dual-drive Commodore disk systems (for example, the 4040). Its purpose was to copy a complete disk from one drive to the other on systems with two drives. The command performs an entire-disk copy operation and relies on the presence of a second physical drive.

On single-drive systems such as the 1541, the DUPLICATE command has no effect and provides no functionality because there is no second drive to target.
