# Nibble mapping for hexadecimal D (0xD)

**Summary:** 4-bit nibble mapping for hexadecimal D ($D, decimal 13) showing the bit-weight columns (8,4,2,1) and the assembled binary/decimal/hex outcome (binary 1101, decimal 13, hex $D).

**Mapping**
Hex digit D corresponds to the 4-bit pattern 1101 (bit3..bit0 = 1 1 0 1). Using standard bit weights (8, 4, 2, 1), the value is assembled as 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13 decimal, which is $D in hexadecimal. There is a single canonical 4-bit representation for nibble D: 1101.

## Source Code
```text
Bit weights:  8   4   2   1
Bits (b3..b0):1   1   0   1
Calculation:  8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13
Decimal:      13
Hex:          $D
Binary (MSB..LSB): %1101
Nibble (hex): 0xD
```
