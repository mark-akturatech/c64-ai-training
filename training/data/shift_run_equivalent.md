# SHIFT-RUN: "LOAD <CR> RUN <CR>" at $ECE7

**Summary:** KERNAL data string at $ECE7-$ECEF containing the Shift+RUN keyboard-buffer message "LOAD<CR>RUN<CR>" (ASCII bytes $4C $4F $41 $44 $0D $52 $55 $4E $0D). Searchable terms: $ECE7, keyboard buffer, Shift-RUN, KERNAL, LOAD <CR> RUN <CR>.

## Shift-RUN string
This KERNAL data sequence is the message placed into the keyboard buffer when the user presses <Shift>-RUN. The bytes form the ASCII string:

- "LOAD" followed by carriage return (ASCII $0D)
- "RUN" followed by carriage return (ASCII $0D)

The sequence occupies addresses $ECE7 through $ECEF in this disassembly.

This string is used by the KERNAL keyboard handling routines (see related "keyboard_table_control") to simulate those keypresses when Shift+RUN is detected, causing the system to behave as if the user typed LOAD<CR>RUN<CR>.

## Source Code
```asm
.; ECE7..ECEF - Shift-RUN equivalent message (KERNAL)
.:ECE7 4C 4F 41 44 0D 52 55 4E  LOAD <CR> RUN <CR>
.:ECEF 0D
```

Byte-by-byte (hex -> ASCII):
```text
$ECE7: $4C -> 'L'
$ECE8: $4F -> 'O'
$ECE9: $41 -> 'A'
$ECEA: $44 -> 'D'
$ECEB: $0D -> <CR>
$ECEC: $52 -> 'R'
$ECED: $55 -> 'U'
$ECEE: $4E -> 'N'
$ECEF: $0D -> <CR>
```
