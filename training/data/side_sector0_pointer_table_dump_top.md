# side_sector0_pointer_table_dump_top (lines 8361–8419)

**Summary:** Top portion of a pointer/track-sector mapping dump from side sector #0, showing repeated two-letter tokens (OF, Or, Oo), numeric entries (14, 08, 12, 78), single-character glyphs, and OCR artifacts. This fragment continues from a preceding columnar pattern and is part of a pointer/track-sector mapping dump that extends beyond this block.

**Description**

This fragment (lines 8361–8419) is part of a pointer/track-sector mapping dump for side sector #0. The text includes:

- Repeated two-letter tokens: "OF", "Or", "Oo", and variants like "Ofc", "OC".
- Numeric entries: 14, 08, 12, 78, 04.
- Single-character and short-glyph lines: "•  78", ";  OF", "1  0", "1  1", "ot", "ut".
- OCR artifacts: "lO" (ambiguous between "10" and "lO"), "0/" (unclear characters), "oo", ".  oo", "■  /~\r~", "0/ ", "ov".

This chunk begins as a continuation of a columnar pattern from the previous file chunk and is the opening portion of a pointer/track-sector mapping dump that continues below.

No explicit register addresses, code listings, or bit maps are present in this fragment. The text appears to be a formatted dump with significant OCR corruption and ambiguous glyphs, making automated parsing unreliable without adjoining context.
