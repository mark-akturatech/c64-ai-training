# Hexadecimal (base 16)

**Summary:** Describes hexadecimal (base 16) notation, digit mapping 0–F, two-hex-digit = one byte (256 values), four-bit nybble units, and the book's convention of prefixing hex numbers with a dollar sign ($).

## Hexadecimal
Hexadecimal is base-16 numbering: digits 0–9 and A–F (A=10 … F=15). Each hex digit represents four bits (a nybble). Two hexadecimal digits provide 16*16 = 256 combinations, so a single byte (8 bits) can be written as two hex digits. The book uses a dollar sign ($) prefix to denote hexadecimal values.
