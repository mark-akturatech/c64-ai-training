# 6520 Data Direction Registers (DDRA, DDRB)

**Summary:** DDRA and DDRB are the two 8-bit Data Direction Registers in the MOS Technology 6520 PIA (Peripheral Interface Adapter); each bit programs the corresponding Peripheral I/O port line as input (0) or output (1). They are normally initialized on Reset but may be changed at runtime to support devices such as keyboards.

## Description
Each Data Direction Register is 8 bits wide and maps one‑to‑one to the corresponding Peripheral I/O port lines:
- A bit value of 0 configures the corresponding port line as an input.
- A bit value of 1 configures the corresponding port line as an output.

DDRA controls Peripheral A port lines; DDRB controls Peripheral B port lines. Changing these registers changes how the associated Peripheral Output and Input registers behave (i.e., whether a written value drives the pin or the pin is read as an input).

## Operation
- Typically programmed during system initialization in the Reset routine.
- Can be modified during normal operation to temporarily reconfigure lines (useful for multiplexing lines or reading devices like keyboards).
- Each bit operates independently; mixed input/output configurations on the same port are allowed.
