# 6545-1 CRT Controller — Start Address, Cursor and Light-Pen Registers

**Summary:** Describes 6545-1 registers R12/R13 (start address / scrolling), Cursor Position R14/R15 (14-bit address compare), and Light-Pen capture R16/R17 (14-bit strobe address). Includes timing/compare behavior with MA/RA, CCLK edge capture, and Mode Control (R8 bit 5) cursor delay.

**Start Address / Scrolling (R12, R13)**
R12 (high) and R13 (low) form the 14-bit memory start address used by the 6545-1 to begin display fetches (the top-left character position of the video display). Subsequent memory addresses are generated by the 6545-1 in response to CCLK pulses. Scrolling is implemented by changing R12 / R13 to the memory address of the character that should appear first on the desired line; whole pages can be scrolled or replaced by updating these two registers.

**Cursor Position High (R14) and Low (R15)**
R14 and R15 together form a 14-bit register that holds the memory address of the current cursor position. When the video display memory-address counter (MA lines) equals the value held in R14/R15, and the scanline counter (RA lines) is within the vertical bounds specified by R10 and R11, the CURSOR output becomes active. The Mode Control Register (R8) bit 5 can be used to delay the CURSOR output by one full CCLK period to support slow-access memories.

**LPEN High (R16) and Low (R17)**
R16 and R17 together form a 14-bit register that stores the video memory address corresponding to a light-pen strobe. When the LPEN input transitions from low to high, the internal scan/address counters are sampled and the resulting address is stored into R16/R17 on the next negative-going edge of CCLK. The stored value represents the video display address at which the LPEN strobe occurred.
