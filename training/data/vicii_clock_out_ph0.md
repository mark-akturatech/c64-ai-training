# COMMODORE 64 - CLOCK OUT (PH0)

**Summary:** PH0 (Phase 0) is the VIC-II–provided 1 MHz clock used as the 65XX processor Phase 0 input; it is generated by dividing the 8 MHz video input clock by eight and all system bus activity is referenced to it.

## Description
PH0 (Phase 0) is the VIC-II clock output that supplies the 65XX processor Phase 0 input. Its frequency is 1 MHz, produced by dividing the 8 MHz video input clock by eight. All system bus activity (memory and I/O timing) is referenced to this PH0 clock.

Processor register access requires PH0 to be high together with AEC (see referenced chunks for details).
