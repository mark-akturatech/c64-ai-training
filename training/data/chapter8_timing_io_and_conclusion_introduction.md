# MACHINE — Chapter 8: Input/Output, and Conclusion

**Summary:** Chapter 8 lists topics on estimating program speed (timing rules and memory cycles), and input/output from tape, disk, and printer including KERNAL I/O handling; it also previews instruction review, debugging, and symbolic assemblers as next steps.
