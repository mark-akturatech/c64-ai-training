# Using the Command Channel from BASIC

**Summary:** Use BASIC statements OPEN, PRINT#, GET#/INPUT#, and CLOSE to communicate with the DOS command channel. Terms: OPEN, PRINT#, GET#, INPUT#, CLOSE, DOS, command channel.

## Procedure
Follow these four steps to use the DOS command channel from BASIC:

1. Establish communications using an OPEN statement.
2. Send commands to the DOS using a PRINT# statement.
   **[Note: Source may contain an error — the original text shows "PR1NT#"; corrected here to "PRINT#".]**
3. Read DOS messages using a GET# or INPUT# statement.
4. Close the channel using a CLOSE statement when finished.
