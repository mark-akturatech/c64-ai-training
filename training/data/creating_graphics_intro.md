# Creating Graphics — Chapter 9

**Summary:** Introduces the role of graphics data in Commodore 64 games and gives an overview of options for creating and entering graphics data; references graphics utility programs (Appendix C) and the topic "hand_coding_graphics".

## Overview
Graphics are required in addition to program logic because a video game is an audio‑visual experience. This chapter explains that creating the graphics data (for use by your game program) is a distinct task from writing game code and that multiple methods exist for producing and entering that data. The choice of method is a matter of personal preference. The chapter also provides instructions for the graphics utility programs referenced in Appendix C.
