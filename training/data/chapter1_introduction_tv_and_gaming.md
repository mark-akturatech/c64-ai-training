# Chapter 1 — You and Your TV

**Summary:** Explains why game authors should understand the television display (raster scan, sync pulses, frame rate) so they can use the computer effectively to present game visuals.

## Motivation
Television sets are ubiquitous and often taken for granted; most people do not know how an image is generated. If you want the television to display your game's visuals correctly and effectively, you should understand the fundamentals of how a TV draws an image (raster scan — line-by-line screen draw) and how timing is controlled (sync pulses — timing signals). That understanding lets you design graphics and timing to best utilize the computer's capabilities.
