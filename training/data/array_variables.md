# COMMODORE 64 - ARRAY VARIABLES (Single-, two- and three-dimensional)

**Summary:** Describes BASIC array variable notation on the C64: single-dimension (XY(5)), two-dimension (XY(5,5)), three-dimension (XY(5,5,5)), the implicit 0–10 subscript range, and the requirement to DIMension arrays larger than eleven elements.

## Array Variables
- Single-dimension: XY(5)
- Two-dimension: XY(5,5)
- Three-dimension: XY(5,5,5)

Arrays may be used with subscripts 0–10 (that is, 11 elements) without an explicit DIM statement. Any array requiring more than eleven elements must be DIMensioned.
