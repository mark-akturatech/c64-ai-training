# Special Graphic Characters (PETSCII → ASCII mapping)

**Summary:** Mapping of PETSCII special graphic characters and their common ASCII equivalents (space, punctuation, brackets, slashes, arithmetic symbols, braces, tilde). The table uses "->" to mark characters that correspond to the PET ASCII character set.

## Overview
This chunk lists PETSCII special graphic characters with short names and common ASCII equivalents. Entries prefixed with "->" denote characters present in the PET ASCII set. The vertical line (|) may be stylized in some fonts to distinguish it from a continuous logical-OR glyph, which is not part of standard ASCII.
