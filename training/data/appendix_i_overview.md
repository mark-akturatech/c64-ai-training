# IA Chip Information (Appendix I)

**Summary:** Lists IA (Interface Adapter) chips relevant to Commodore systems: 6520 PIA, 6522 VIA, 6525 TPA, 6526 CIA, 6545 CRTC, 6560 VIC, 6566 VIC-II, and 6581 SID — material adapted from manufacturer specifications and intended as reference rather than essential machine-language instruction.

## Overview
This appendix compiles manufacturer-specification material for a set of interface adapter (IA) and peripheral chips used with 6502-based systems. The content is described as informative background for further hardware study; it is not required for basic machine-language programming. The material aims to provide otherwise hard-to-find specification details adapted from vendor datasheets.

## Chips Covered
- 6520 PIA — Peripheral Interface Adapter  
- 6522 VIA — Versatile Interface Adapter  
- 6525 TPA — Tri Port Adapter  
- 6526 CIA — Complex Interface Adapter (used in many Commodore machines)  
- 6545 CRTC — CRT Controller  
- 6560 VIC — Video Interface Chip (original VIC)  
- 6566 VIC-II — Video Interface Chip (VIC-II family)  
- 6581 SID — Sound Interface Device

## Notes
- Material is adapted from manufacturer specifications and presented as reference.  
- The appendix states these specifications are “not essential to machine language programming.”  
- Use the listed chip names and numbers as search terms when locating the more detailed entries or datasheets.
