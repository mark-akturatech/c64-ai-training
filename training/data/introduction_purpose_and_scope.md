# Inside Commodore DOS — Chapter 1: Introduction

**Summary:** Introduction to the manual's purpose, intended audience, relationship to the Commodore 1541 User's Manual, and that most material is the authors' disassembly and annotation of the 1541 DOS; searchable terms: 1541, DOS, disassembly, diskette formatting, file storage, disk recovery.

**Purpose and Scope**

This manual supplements the documentation in the 1541 User's Manual and is primarily intended for intermediate-to-advanced programmers, though novice Commodore users interested in the 1541's internals may find it useful. It does not replace Commodore's documentation; readers are assumed reasonably familiar with the 1541 User's Manual. Some overlapping material is included for continuity, but most content is original, derived from intensive disassembly and annotation of the 1541's DOS.

**Intended Audience**

- Intermediate to advanced programmers working with the Commodore 1541 disk drive and its DOS.
- Novice Commodore users who want deeper technical detail about disk operation and structure.

**Relation to the 1541 User's Manual and Authorship**

- This manual was not prepared with the assistance of Commodore Business Machines, Inc.
- Material is based on the authors' disassembly and annotation work on the 1541 DOS, plus published articles, notes, and discussions with other disk experts.
- The authors state the material has been thoroughly researched and tested, but accuracy is not guaranteed.

**Goals / Reasons for Writing**

The manual lists the following specific objectives:

1. To correct errors and omissions in the 1541 User's Manual.
2. To help users make more effective use of their disk drive.
3. To provide complete information on diskette formatting.
4. To provide complete information on the storage of files.
5. To allow users to read and write data in non-standard ways.
6. To help users make backup copies of "protected" diskettes.
7. To help users recover damaged diskettes.
8. To help users understand the operation of the disk drive.

Although focused on the 1541, much of the information also applies to other Commodore disk drives.
