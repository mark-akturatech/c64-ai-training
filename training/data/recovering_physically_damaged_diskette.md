# Recovering a Physically Damaged Diskette

**Summary:** Steps to recover a physically damaged 5.25" diskette by re-jacketing and cleaning the plastic disk; includes handling precautions, washing gummy media with photographer's wetting agent, re-inserting into a new or reusable jacket, initializing (formatting) and immediately making a backup.

## Recovery Procedure
1. Prepare: put on disposable plastic gloves before handling the disk to avoid fingerprints and contamination.
2. Open the jacket: carefully slit open the protective jacket and remove the plastic disk (do not touch the magnetic recording surface).
3. Handle only by edges or hub: always handle the plastic disk by its outer edges or the central hub ring; keep a mental note of which side faces up (the reinforcing ring is usually affixed to the upper side).
4. If the disk is gummy: wash the plastic disk carefully using a small amount of photographer's wetting agent mixed with water to avoid residue; do not use agents that leave deposits. Allow the plastic disk to air-dry completely.
5. Re-jacket: insert the cleaned plastic disk into another jacket. Note this may require destroying a perfectly good diskette to obtain a replacement jacket. Some head-cleaner kits include a reusable jacket suitable for this purpose.
6. Initialize (format) the disk: attempt to initialize the disk in your drive. If initialization fails, try flipping the disk over (you may have the wrong side up).
7. Backup immediately: if initialization succeeds, make a backup copy immediately.
