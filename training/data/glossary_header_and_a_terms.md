# MACHINE — Glossary: A-terms (Absolute Address to Assembly code)

**Summary:** Definitions of machine-level terms used in the text: Absolute Address, Accumulator, Address Bus, Address mode, Address, Algorithm, Arithmetic shift or rotate, Assembler, Assembly, and Assembly code. Useful for searching glossary entries and locating where terms first appear (chapter numbers included).

## Definitions

Absolute Address (5)
An address that can indicate any location in memory.

Accumulator (3)
The A register; the register used for arithmetic.

Address Bus (1)
A bus that signals which part of memory is wanted for the next memory operation.

Address mode (5)
The manner in which an instruction reaches information within memory.

Address (1)
The identity of a specific location within memory.

Algorithm (1)
A method or procedure to perform a computing task.

Arithmetic shift or rotate (4)
A shift or rotate that usually preserves the sign of a number.

Assembler (2)
A program that assembles or changes source code into object code.

Assembly (1)
The process of changing source code into object code.

Assembly code (1)
Also called source code. A program written in a somewhat human-readable form. Must be translated ("assembled") before use.
