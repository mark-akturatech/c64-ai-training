# Diskette Insertion — Drive Door Type 1 and Type 2, Orientation and Removal Warnings

**Summary:** Procedures for inserting and removing 5.25" diskettes in two drive-door styles (Type 1 and Type 2); orientation: face-up (label up), large opening first, write‑protect notch to the left; warnings about write-protect and never removing a disk while the red drive light is on.

**Insertion / Removal Procedure**

**Type 1 (Spring-Eject Door):**

- **Open:** Press the door catch lightly; the door will pop open. If a diskette is present, it will be ejected by a small spring.
- **Insert:** Place the diskette face-up (label up) with the large media opening going in first and the write-protect notch to the left (the demonstration disk shows the notch covered with tape).
- **Seat:** Press the diskette in gently until you feel a click and the diskette no longer springs out.
- **Close:** Pull the drive door downward until the latch clicks into place.
- **Ready:** The drive is ready for use after the latch clicks.

**Type 2 (Lever-Actuated Door):**

- **Open:** Turn the door lever counter-clockwise to open.
- **Insert:** Place the diskette face-up (label up) with the large opening going in first and the write-protect notch to the left (the demonstration disk has the notch covered with tape).
- **Close:** Turn the door lever clockwise until the latch clicks into place.
- **Ready:** The drive is ready for use after the latch clicks.

**General Warnings and Notes:**

- Always remove the diskette before turning the drive (or computer) on or off.
- Never remove a diskette while the red drive light is on — data can be destroyed during drive activity.
- The demonstration disk shows the write-protect notch covered with tape (manual note).
