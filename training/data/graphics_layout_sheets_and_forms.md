# Graphics layout reference: sample grid sheets (Figs. 9-1 through 9-7) — C64 25×40 character grid

**Summary:** Reference to sample graphics layout sheets (Figs. 9-1–9-7) showing fine grids proportional to TV pixels and a heavy grid marking Commodore 64 character cell boundaries (25 lines × 40 characters). Intended as pixel-accurate layout templates for C64 graphics.

**Description**

This chunk points to a set of sample graphics layout sheets (Figures 9-1 through 9-7). Each sheet is described as containing:

- A fine grid scaled to TV pixels (for pixel-accurate artwork).
- A heavy grid delineating character cell boundaries appropriate to the Commodore 64 text/graphics layout (25 lines × 40 characters).

The text fragment is truncated mid-sentence: "One thing that you should keep in mind when you are creating graphics for use on the Commodore 64 is that it is often necessary to use more than one..." — the remainder (what is "more than one") is missing.
