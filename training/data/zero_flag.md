# Architecture of 6502 Microprocessor - Zero Flag (Z)

**Summary:** The Zero Flag (Z) is a single bit in the 6502 Processor Status register (P) that is set when the result of the last operation was zero. Searchable terms: 6502, Zero Flag, Z, Processor Status, P register.

## Zero Flag
The Zero Flag (Z) indicates whether the result of the most recent operation was zero. When set, Z = 1; when the result was non‑zero, Z = 0. The Z bit is part of the processor status register P (see referenced chunk for the full status-register layout).
