# byRiclianll - Blank line separating TRACK 06 - SECTOR 16 dump from the next traced sector (TRACK 19 - SECTOR 15 side sector #3).

**Summary:** Notes that a blank line separates a dump of TRACK 06 - SECTOR 16 from the next traced sector output (TRACK 19 - SECTOR 15, labeled "side sector #3"); relevant searchable terms: TRACK 06, SECTOR 16, TRACK 19, SECTOR 15, side sector #3, dump delimiter.

**Description**
This chunk is a single-line metadata note describing the visual/layout separator between two sector dump blocks: the TRACK 06 / SECTOR 16 dump and the following traced sector labeled TRACK 19 / SECTOR 15 (side sector #3). The only concrete observation recorded is the presence of a blank line between these two traced-sector outputs.

No sector data, disk format details, or timestamps are present in this chunk. The note appears to function as an annotation in a sequence of traced sector dumps, calling attention to a blank-line separator that may indicate a logical break between dump records.
