# Multidirectional Scrolling Techniques — Cadaver (Credits & Background)

**Summary:** Credits and provenance for Cadaver's C-64 multidirectional and blockmap-scrolling techniques; cites the book "C-64 Pelintekijan Opas" (Jukka Tapanimaki), late-1980s blockmap experiments, and notes these are the author's personal methods rather than canonical implementations.

## Background
The material originates partly from Jukka Tapanimaki's book "C-64 Pelintekijan Opas" ("C-64 Game Maker's Guide") and from personal experiments with blockmap-scrolling begun in the late 1980s (initial experiments by the author's brother, followed by the author). The techniques discussed elsewhere in this collection focus on multidirectional scrolling approaches for the Commodore 64 (blockmap-based methods among them).

## Author's note
The descriptions and methods are the author's own experience and experimentation; they are presented as working approaches rather than definitive or optimal solutions.
