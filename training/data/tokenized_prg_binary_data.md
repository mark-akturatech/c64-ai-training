# DISPTS.PRG — Tokenized PRG Data (TOK64 / STOP Markers)

**Summary:** This chunk contains the uuencoded tokenized BASIC program file `DISPTS.PRG`, produced by TOK64 with STOP markers. It includes the binary/tokenized PRG payload for `DISPTS.PRG`, featuring token sequences like BHJ. To reconstruct a human-readable BASIC listing, uudecode the content and then detokenize it using the TOK64 detokenizer.

**Description**

This chunk provides the raw tokenized PRG payload for `DISPTS.PRG` as generated by TOK64. The content is uuencoded (begin 644 ... end) and comprises token sequences and embedded binary data, not a plain-text BASIC listing. This file represents the tokenized/binary form of a BASIC program, corresponding to a human-readable source available elsewhere.

**Notes:**

- To obtain the readable BASIC source, uudecode the block and process it with the TOK64 detokenizer or an equivalent tool.
- The token patterns (e.g., repeated BHJ sequences) are characteristic of TOK64 tokenization and embedded binary data; avoid simple text editing.
- This chunk does not list C64 registers and contains no register-address metadata.
