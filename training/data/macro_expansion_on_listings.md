# Macro expansion on assembler printouts

**Summary:** Describes assembler macro expansion on listing/printouts: option to print expanded macro bodies with substitutions (commonly marked by a '+' prefix) to aid debugging and to avoid manual expansion when checking generated code.

## Description
Many assemblers provide an option to expand macros on the printed listing. When enabled, each macro call in the source is followed in the listing by the code the macro generates with all argument substitutions shown. The generated lines are typically marked (for example, prefixed with '+') so you can distinguish expansion output from handwritten source.

This expansion lets you see exactly what instructions, labels and operands the macro produced without having to open the macro library and mentally substitute parameters. It is primarily a debugging convenience: you can verify substitutions, implied addressing modes, and any labels generated by the macro in the context where it was used.

## Workflow guidance
- Enable macro expansion while you are developing and debugging macros or code that uses unfamiliar macros; the expanded listing reduces error-prone manual expansion.
- Once macros are debugged and stable, disable expanded printouts to reduce listing verbosity; you will rarely need the expanded view for routine development.
- If a macro generates internal labels or symbols, consult the symbol table or symbol-sorting listing (see references) to inspect visibility and naming collisions.
