# Return of the Phoenix — Gameplay

**Summary:** Gameplay involves a wizard (choice of two characters: high/flying or low/bottom-only) defending a castle from a phoenix by shooting spells to prevent the phoenix from building a three-tier bridge; the game has nine difficulty levels with a self‑adjusting difficulty system and special phoenix attacks such as sleep spells (stun ~3s).

## Game Overview
You play a wizard protecting a castle from a magical phoenix. The wizard stuns the phoenix by shooting spells from a staff. The phoenix attempts to construct a three-tier bridge in the sky by collecting an energy spell at the bottom of the screen, carrying it to the top, and thereby adding one section to the bridge. Gameplay continues until the bridge reaches three tiers; at that point both the player and the phoenix have scores and the higher score wins.

## Player Characters
- Two wizard types are available; you choose which to control before starting.
  - High wizard: can fly freely around the screen and traverse virtually anywhere the phoenix can.
  - Low wizard: constrained to the bottom area of the screen (different play style).
- Pressing the fire button after choosing a wizard initiates gameplay in that mode.

## Objective and Win Condition
- Prevent the phoenix from completing the three-tier bridge by stunning or otherwise interrupting its attempts to fetch and deliver energy spells.
- When the bridge reaches three tiers the round ends; compare scores (player vs. phoenix). If the player's score is higher, the player wins.

## Difficulty Levels and Self‑Adjusting System
- There are nine difficulty levels (1–9). The current skill level is displayed at the top-center of the screen.
- The program continuously monitors player performance and modifies the skill level automatically (self‑adjusting difficulty).
- The skill level will be increased if the program detects strong play. It will be decreased if performance is poor, but only when the current level is above level 4 (i.e., decreases are allowed only for levels 5–9).

## Phoenix Behavior and Level Effects
- Starting at level 2, the phoenix begins to drop sleep spells that stun a hit wizard for about three seconds.
- At higher difficulty levels the phoenix:
  - Moves faster.
  - Fires (drops/uses) spells more often.
- At some higher levels the wizard’s movement speed may also be increased.
