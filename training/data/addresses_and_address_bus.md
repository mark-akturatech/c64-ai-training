# 6502 Address Bus (16-bit)

**Summary:** 6502 address bus is 16 bits wide, providing linear addresses from $0000 to $FFFF (binary 0000000000000000 to 1111111111111111). Searchable terms: 16-bit address bus, $0000, $FFFF, addressable memory.

## Overview
The 6502 uses a 16-bit address bus, allowing the processor to place any address between binary 0000000000000000 and 1111111111111111 on the bus. Those addresses are conventionally shown in hexadecimal as $0000 through $FFFF.
