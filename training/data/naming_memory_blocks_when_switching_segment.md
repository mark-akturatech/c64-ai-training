# Kick Assembler: .segment Shorthand for Naming Memory Blocks

**Summary:** Explains how in Kick Assembler, placing a quoted string after the `.segment` directive (e.g., `.segment Data "Static Text"`) is equivalent to switching segments and creating a memory block (`.memblock "Static Text"`). Discusses the use of `.text` and `.byte` directives and the `-showmem` option to display the memory map.

**Description**

In Kick Assembler, appending a quoted label immediately after the `.segment` directive creates a named memory block while switching to the specified segment. This shorthand:

- `.segment Name "Label"`

is functionally equivalent to:

- `.segment Name`
- `.memblock "Label"`

The quoted label becomes the memory block's name, appearing in memory maps generated by Kick Assembler's `-showmem` option.

For example, the following directives embed ASCII bytes and a numeric byte:

- `.text "hello world!"`
- `.byte $ff`

When assembling with the `-showmem` option, Kick Assembler reports the named memory blocks and their address ranges.

## Source Code

The following assembler source code demonstrates the use of `.segment` with a quoted label, along with the `.text` and `.byte` directives:

```asm
.segment Data "Static Text"
.text "hello world!"
.byte $ff
```

To establish specific segment base addresses, you can define segments with starting addresses using the `.segmentdef` directive. For instance, to set the base addresses for the "Main" and "Color Setup" segments:

```asm
.segmentdef Main [start=$0900]
.segmentdef ColorSetup [start=$0907]
```

Then, you can switch to these segments and add code or data:

```asm
.segment Main
; Main segment code here

.segment ColorSetup
; Color Setup segment code here
```

The trailing '}' in the original snippet appears to be a leftover character and is not part of the valid Kick Assembler syntax. It should be removed to avoid syntax errors.

Regarding the lifetime and scope of the memory block label, it is tied to the segment in which it is defined. The label remains valid as long as the segment is active and accessible within the assembly process.

When you run the assembler with the `-showmem` option, it reports the named memory blocks and their address ranges. For example:

```text
Code-segment:
$0900-$0906 Main
$0907-$0913 Color Setup
```

This output indicates that the "Main" segment occupies memory addresses from `$0900` to `$0906`, and the "Color Setup" segment occupies addresses from `$0907` to `$0913`.
