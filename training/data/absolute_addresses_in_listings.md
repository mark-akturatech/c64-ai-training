# Assembler listings must show absolute addresses

**Summary:** Assemblers must print absolute 16-bit addresses for every instruction, data statement, and used hardware or RAM register in their listing; absolute-address information is essential for effective debugging and correct linking/loading.

## Rationale
An assembler listing that omits absolute addresses leaves you unanchored when debugging: you cannot correlate code lines with runtime memory locations, hardware registers, or output object/hex files. Every emitted instruction and data directive, plus any referenced hardware or RAM addresses, must be shown with their final absolute address so you can:

- Verify placement against your memory map and loader.
- Cross-reference runtime behavior (interrupt vectors, hardware ports).
- Inspect and patch machine code at specific addresses.
- Compare assembly output to hex/object files and to memory dumps.

## Required assembler listing contents
Ensure your assembler listing includes, for each source line that produces bytes or uses addresses:
- The resolved absolute 16-bit address of the first byte generated by that source line (e.g. $C000).
- The machine bytes emitted for that line.
- Labels and symbols with their resolved absolute address (symbol table showing resolved addresses).
- Data statements' addresses (DEFB/DB, DEFW/WD, etc.) and the bytes they generate.
- Any uses of hardware or zero-page/RAM registers listed with their absolute addresses where they are referenced.

If your assembler cannot provide this information, debugging becomes error-prone and time-consuming; consider using a different tool or a post-pass linker/mapper that can produce a fully resolved annotated listing.
