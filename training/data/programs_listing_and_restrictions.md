# Notes about the 46 BASIC disk utility programs

**Summary:** Describes 46 copyrighted BASIC disk-utility programs, recommended precautions for typing and testing (especially DATA statements containing machine language), and inclusion of machine-language source listings (.PAL) for use with the PAL assembler. Mentions testing on multiple 1541 disk drives and use of Commodore direct-access disk commands.

## Notes
- The book includes listings for 46 ready-to-use BASIC programs; these programs are copyrighted and may NOT be used commercially (in whole or in part).
- Programs are disk utilities (no graphics/sound) that rely on Commodore direct-access disk commands. They are powerful tools and can cause data loss if used improperly.
- Do not share program listings with persons who do not own a legitimate copy of this book; sharing typed listings with a friend who owns the book is allowed.
- Always experiment on a sacrificial/test diskette before running a program on a diskette containing valuable programs or data.
- Many programs are long; typing them in is time-consuming — sharing typing work with another purchaser is suggested (subject to the copyright restriction above).
- Each program was individually tested on a variety of 1541 disk drives (wide range of serial numbers) and reportedly worked perfectly during testing; however, no guarantee can be made that a program will work with every model or configuration.
- If a program fails, first re-check typing accuracy. Typographical errors in BASIC lines or in DATA statements (which contain embedded machine language) are a common source of problems.
- Machine-language source listings are provided immediately after their related BASIC listings with filenames ending in ".PAL" for use with the PAL assembler. If using a different assembler, expect to make minor adjustments to the source.
- The programs were designed to be both useful and instructive and demonstrate contemporary techniques for direct disk access on the Commodore 64/1541.
