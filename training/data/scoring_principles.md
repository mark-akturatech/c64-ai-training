# Scoring (game design principles)

**Summary:** Principles for in-game scoring: always display the score, award points for actions that advance the player toward the goal, vary point values by action and difficulty level, use sound cues for score events, and employ bonuses to influence player behavior; scoring values are subjective and refined during testing.

## Principles
- Display the score constantly so the player can monitor progress at a glance.
- Award points for actions that meaningfully help the player toward the game's objective.
- Vary point values by action type and (optionally) current difficulty level to reflect relative importance and challenge.
- Use short, appropriate sound effects when points are awarded so the player receives feedback without needing to look at the score.
- Use bonuses to entice specific behaviors (immediate reward that may or may not be optimal long‑term).

## Balancing and refinement
- Point magnitudes are subjective: make typical scores feel substantial but not incomprehensible.
- Expect to iterate: final scoring methods are usually discovered and tuned during playtesting.
- Consider how bonuses affect player strategy and whether they create desirable or unintended incentives.
