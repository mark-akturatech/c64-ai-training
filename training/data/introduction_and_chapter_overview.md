# MACHINE — Introductory motivation

**Summary:** Reasons to learn machine language: speed, versatility, and direct comprehension of how the computer works; prerequisites include basic programming concepts (loops, branching, subroutines), and Chapter 1 covers 650x architecture, binary/hex notation, and use of a machine language monitor.

## Introduction
Three practical motivations for learning machine language are highlighted:
- Speed — machine language programs run significantly faster than higher-level languages.
- Versatility — machine language imposes no artificial limits; all hardware features are directly accessible.
- Comprehension — the computer natively executes machine code, so understanding machine language reveals the machine's true operation.

Machine language is described as "finicky" (individual instructions do little) but straightforward; a program requires many small instructions, yet each instruction is simple and learnable. Some programmers who began in machine language consider higher-level languages (for example, BASIC) less precise by comparison.

## Portability of skills
- Skills transfer across systems: learning the principles of binary computers and low-level programming eases adaptation to other machines.
- For other systems using the 6502 family (e.g., Apple, Atari) you must learn the specific machine architecture and the local machine language monitor, but the same principles apply.
- For non-6502 CPUs, you must learn a new instruction set, but prior exposure to machine-level concepts substantially reduces the learning curve.

## Prerequisites
- Basic programming fundamentals are assumed: loops, branching, subroutines, and decision making.
- No requirement to be an advanced BASIC programmer.

## Chapter 1 topics
This chapter introduces the following topics:
- The inner workings of microcomputers
- Computer notation: binary and hexadecimal
- The 650x (6502-family) inner architecture
- Beginning use of a machine language monitor
- First machine language commands
- Writing and entering a simple program
