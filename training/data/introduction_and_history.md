# MOS Technology 6502 — Overview

**Summary:** The MOS Technology 6502 is an 8‑bit microprocessor introduced in the late 1970s; it powered many home and hobbyist systems (Apple II, BBC Model B, Acorn Electron, Atari 800, Commodore 64, VIC‑20, PET) and is known for a simple instruction set and very low production cost.

## Overview
The 6502 was produced by MOS Technology in the late 1970s and became a widely used CPU in early microcomputers. Its design emphasized simplicity and low transistor count, which allowed aggressive pricing and broad adoption in consumer machines. The instruction set is compact and orthogonal by the standards of that era, making it straightforward to implement and manufacture.

## Systems that used the 6502
- Apple II series
- BBC Micro (Model B)
- Acorn Electron
- Atari 400/800 family (including Atari 800)
- Commodore PET
- Commodore VIC‑20
- Commodore 64 (as the CPU alongside the VIC‑II and SID chips)

## Legacy
The 6502’s combination of low cost and adequate performance for the time drove widespread use in education, hobbyist, and commercial systems. Its instruction set and architecture influenced later designs and remain relevant to retrocomputing and embedded projects.
