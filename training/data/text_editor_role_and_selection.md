# Assembler Text Editor — Role and Buying Advice

**Summary:** The assembler text editor is the primary interface for entering and modifying source code; some assemblers permit using an external word processor. Verify available editing commands and try editors before purchasing because limited editors waste programming time.

**Role of the Text Editor**
The text editor in an assembler is the tool you will use most for entering, modifying, and updating your assembly source. It must support the editing commands and workflows you need (search/replace, block operations, cursor navigation, insertion/deletion, file I/O). Some assemblers allow the use of an external word processor to create the source files; whether built-in or external, familiarity and comfort with the editor’s command set directly affect productivity.

**Buying and Usage Advice**
- Test editors before buying: editors with severe limitations will consume programming time.
- Ensure the editor supports the features you require for efficient assembly development.
- If the assembler permits external editors/word processors, confirm file format compatibility (plain ASCII source, line endings) and the ease of integrating edit/assemble cycles.
