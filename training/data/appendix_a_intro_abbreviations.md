# APPENDIX A — ABBREVIATIONS FOR BASIC KEYWORDS

**Summary:** Commodore 64 BASIC keyword abbreviations: form most keywords by typing the first one or two letters plus the next letter with SHIFT; PRINT is abbreviated as '?'; abbreviations used in program lines LIST in their full keyword form.

## Formation of abbreviations
To save typing, most BASIC keywords may be entered in abbreviated form. For keywords other than PRINT, type the first one or two letters of the keyword, then type the next letter while holding SHIFT (i.e., the "SHIFTed" next letter). This sequence produces the keyword abbreviation.

## Special case: PRINT
PRINT is abbreviated by a single question mark character: ?. 

## Behavior in program lines
When an abbreviation is entered inside a program line, the interpreter stores it but will LIST the program showing the full keyword (not the abbreviation).
