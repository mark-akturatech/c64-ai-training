**Summary:** Lists optional disk programs for Commodore machines and PET/CBM/VIC-20: SUPERMON variants (SUPERMON64), UNICOPY64 and related files, COPY-ALL and CROSS REF variants, FACTORS, PENTOMINOS family (including B128 boot/transfer files), STRING THING, and sample files.

## Program List Overview
This appendix enumerates the supplementary programs supplied on the optional disk. File names and target machines are preserved exactly as listed on the disk (PET/CBM, VIC-20, Commodore 64, PLUS/4, and B128 where indicated). The list includes monitor/debuggers (SUPERMON variants), copy/utility programs (UNICOPY64, COPY-ALL), cross-reference tools, small utilities (FACTORS, STRING THING), and the PENTOMINOS suite with associated boot/transfer files and instructions.

Do not rely on this section for file contents or usage instructions — consult the corresponding instruction files (marked INST) or the cross-referenced documentation entries for usage and loading details.
