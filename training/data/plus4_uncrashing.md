# Commodore PLUS/4 — Enter machine language monitor from a crash

**Summary:** Uncrash technique for the Commodore PLUS/4: press the RESET button (next to the power switch) while holding RUN/STOP + CTRL to enter the machine language monitor.

## Procedure
1. Hold down the RUN/STOP and CTRL keys.
2. While still holding those keys, press the physical RESET button located next to the power switch on the PLUS/4.
3. The system will enter the machine language monitor (ML monitor).

## Description
This is a hardware/keyboard combination that forces the PLUS/4 into its built-in machine language monitor after a crash or lock-up. The keys must be held before pressing RESET; pressing RESET alone will not invoke this monitor mode.
