# Controlling Output

**Summary:** Chapter 2 covers calling machine-language subroutines (JSR/RTS), the PRINT output subroutine (CHROUT), addressing modes (immediate, indexed), calling machine code from BASIC, tiny assembler examples, simple loops, and basic disassembly techniques.

## Topics Covered
- Calling machine-language subroutines — invoking routines with JSR and returning with RTS.
- The PRINT subroutine — discusses the output/character routine (CHROUT).
- Immediate addressing — using constant operands in instructions.
- Calling machine language from BASIC — how BASIC invokes machine-code routines.
- Tiny assembler programs — short example programs assembled for demonstration.
- Indexed addressing — using X/Y registers to index memory operands.
- Simple loops — loop constructs implemented in 6502 assembly.
- Disassembly — basic techniques for reading small machine-code listings.
