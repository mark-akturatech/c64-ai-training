# CRTC Register R9 — Scan Line

**Summary:** CRTC R9 is a 5-bit register that specifies the number of scan lines per character row (including any inter-line spacing). Searchable terms: CRTC, R9, Scan Line, 5-bit, character row height.

## Description
This register contains a 5-bit value (bits D0–D4) that the CRTC uses to determine the number of raster scan lines allocated to each character row, counting any spacing lines as part of the total. Valid numeric range is 0–31 (5 bits). The programmed value directly affects character cell height and the vertical timing of character rows generated by the CRTC.
