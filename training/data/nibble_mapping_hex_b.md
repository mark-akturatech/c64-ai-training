# Nibble mapping — Hex B (0xB, decimal 11)

**Summary:** 4-bit nibble breakdown for hexadecimal B (decimal 11). Shows the single 4-bit pattern (1011) and the per-bit weight contributions (8, 4, 2, 1).

**Nibble breakdown**

Hex digit B (0xB) equals decimal 11. In a 4-bit nibble with bit weights [8, 4, 2, 1] (bits b3 b2 b1 b0 respectively), the pattern that produces 11 is:

- b3 b2 b1 b0 = 1 0 1 1
- Contributions: 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11
- Binary: %1011
- Hex: $B (0xB)
- Decimal: 11

(Brief parenthetical: bit order shown as b3..b0 = most-significant to least-significant.)
