# MACHINE - Glossary (F–M)

**Summary:** Concise glossary of machine-level and system terms for 6502/C64 work: index/index register (X, Y), indirect addressing, interrupts (enable/flag/register/source), Kernal (Commodore OS), logical operators (AND, ORA, EOR), logical shift/rotate, floating accumulator and garbage collection in BASIC, machine code/language, and other related terms.

## Definitions
File
- A collection of data stored on some external device.

Flag
- An on/off indicator that signals some condition.

Floating accumulator
- A group of memory locations used by BASIC to perform calculations on a number.

Garbage collection
- A BASIC process in which active strings are gathered together and inactive strings are discarded. On some computers this can be time consuming.

Increment
- To make larger by a value of one.

Index
- To change an address by adding the contents of an index register.

Index register
- The X or Y register, which may be used for changing effective addresses.

Indirect address
- An addressing scheme whereby the instruction contains the location of the actual address to be used; an address of an address.

Instruction
- An element of a program that tells the processor what to do.

Interrupt
- An event that causes the processor to leave its normal program so that some other program takes control, usually temporarily.

Interrupt enable register
- A location within an IA chip that determines whether or not a selected event will cause an interrupt.

Interrupt flag
- A signal within the IA indicating that a certain event has requested that an interrupt take place.

Interrupt flag register
- A location within the IA where interrupt events can be detected and turned off if desired.

Interrupt source
- The particular event that caused an interrupt; when multiple sources exist you must identify the specific source.

Kernal
- Commodore's operating system.

Label (symbolic address)
- A name identifying a memory location.

Latch
- A flag that "locks in."

Load
- To bring information from memory into the processor; a load operation copies data into the CPU while leaving the original in memory.

Logical file number
- The identity of a file as used by the programmer.

Logical operator
- An operation that affects individual bits within a byte: AND, ORA, and EOR.

Logical shift or rotate
- A shift that does not preserve the sign of a signed number.

Machine code
- Instructions written in machine language.

Machine language
- The set of commands that allow you to give instructions to the processor.
