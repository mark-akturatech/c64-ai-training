# DIR — Track 16 Sector 01: hex/ASCII dump (start)

**Summary:** Start of the hex/ASCII dump for the first data block of the 'DIR' program (Track 16, Sector 01). Contains the human-readable lead-in line, block header, and the initial transcribed bytes/token and ASCII fragments.

**Block Overview**

This chunk contains the introductory text and the first lines of the raw hex/ASCII dump for the first data block of the disk file named "DIR" (Track 16, Sector 01). The transcribed lines include the human-readable lead-in ("Let's look at the first block in this file."), the block header ("TRACK 16 - SECTOR 01"), followed by the initial sequence of byte tokens and short ASCII/token fragments as they were captured.

The dump appears to be a textual transcription of the beginning bytes and token/ASCII fragments. Several tokens resemble hex byte values or PETSCII/token fragments, but some characters are ambiguous due to potential OCR artifacts. The complete block continues in the referenced follow-up chunks.
