# Kick Assembler — Math Constants (PI, E)

**Summary:** Lists Kick Assembler math constants PI and E with full numeric values (3.141592653589793, 2.718281828459045). Searchable terms: PI, E, Kick Assembler, math constants, Java Math.

## Description
Kick Assembler exposes two predefined high-precision math constants: PI and E. These constants are provided as numeric literals usable in assembler expressions and the Kick Assembler math library. The math library is implemented on top of Java's Math (Java Math constants/operations), with "mod" noted as the only function implemented differently from Java's standard library.

Values are given to the precision shown below and should be treated as double-precision floating-point constants consistent with Java's Math definitions.
