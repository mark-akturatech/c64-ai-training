# How to Choose an Assembler

**Summary:** Describes the central role of an assembler in machine-language game development and lists the three essential components of a complete assembler package: a text editor, the assembler itself, and a machine-language monitor.

## Overview
A good assembler program is the primary design aid for creating machine-language programs; after the computer, it is the most essential tool for development. A complete assembler package consists of three parts:

- A text editor — for writing and editing source code.
- The assembler — translates assembly source into machine code.
- A machine-language monitor — for inspecting, testing, and debugging machine code.
