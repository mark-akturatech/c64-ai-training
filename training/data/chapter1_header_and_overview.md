**Summary:** Chapter 1 heading and table of contents listing BASIC programming topics: Screen Display Codes (BASIC character set), Programming Numbers and Variables, Expressions and Operators, and Programming Techniques.

**Overview**

This chunk is the front matter/chapter heading for "BASIC PROGRAMMING RULES" (Chapter 1). It lists the chapter's subtopics without providing the detailed content:

- Introduction
- Screen Display Codes (BASIC character set)
- Programming Numbers and Variables
- Expressions and Operators
- Programming Techniques

No explanatory text, examples, character tables, or code listings are present in this chunk—it only establishes the chapter structure.

## Source Code

(omitted—no assembly/BASIC listings, register maps, or diagrams present in source)

## Key Registers

(omitted—this chunk does not reference any hardware registers or addresses)

## References
