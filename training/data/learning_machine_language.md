# Learning 6502 Machine Language (C-64 Demos)

**Summary:** How to learn 6502 assembly for Commodore 64 demos: study a short assembler tutorial, learn key 6502 instructions and addressing modes, use the Programmer's Reference Guide for opcode reference, and consult a detailed C-64 memory map (Mapping the C-64) because the C-64 uses memory-mapped I/O.

## Learning Machine Language
- Get a concise assembler tutorial and work through examples to grasp the general structure of 6502 assembly programs.
- Learn the important 6502 instructions and addressing modes (immediate, zeropage, absolute, indirect, indexed) — these are the core tools for demo coding.
- Acquire a good reference (for example, the Programmer's Reference Guide) for opcode summaries and exact instruction/encoding details; you do not need to read unrelated BASIC material in the same book.
- Study a detailed C-64 memory map (Mapping the C-64) to learn which addresses are memory-mapped I/O versus plain RAM — practical demo effects come from poking the correct I/O locations.
- Read short assembler tutorials such as those found in the early issues of Commodore Hacking for hands-on examples.
- If you already understand assembler structure, you can often get started with just a reference and example code rather than a full tutorial.
