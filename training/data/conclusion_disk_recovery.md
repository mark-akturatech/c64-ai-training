# Conclusion: Recovering a Damaged Diskette

**Summary:** Recovery of a damaged diskette is primarily experiential — tools and utilities (diskette recovery utilities, short-NEW techniques) can help, but prevention (backups, careful handling) is far more reliable than repair.

## Conclusion
Recovering a damaged diskette is more art than science. The utilities and techniques described elsewhere can be invaluable when needed, but creating errors is much easier than fixing them. The recommended final course is prevention: keep regular backups and handle diskettes carefully to avoid needing recovery procedures.
