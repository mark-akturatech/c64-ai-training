# Arithmetic expressions (Commodore 64 BASIC)

**Summary:** Describes arithmetic operators in C64 BASIC: +, -, *, /, ^; explains that arithmetic is performed using floating-point numbers and that integers are converted to floating-point for operations and back to integers when assigned to integer variables (integer variables use % suffix).

## Arithmetic operations
Arithmetic operators in C64 BASIC perform operations on the two operands surrounding the operator. The available operators are:
- + (addition)
- - (subtraction and unary minus)
- * (multiplication)
- / (division)
- ^ (exponentiation)

All arithmetic operations are executed using floating-point arithmetic. Any integer operand is converted to floating-point before the operation; if the operation result is later assigned to an integer variable name, the result is converted back to an integer.

## Addition (+)
The plus sign (+) specifies that the operand on the right is added to the operand on the left.
