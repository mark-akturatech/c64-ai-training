# 6526 (CIA) — Maximum Ratings and Device Protection Note

**Summary:** 6526 (CIA) absolute maximum ratings: Supply Voltage and Input/Output Voltage limits, Operating and Storage Temperature ranges, and a device note on input protection circuitry and the effects of exceeding absolute maximum ratings.

## Maximum Ratings
- Supply Voltage, Vcc: -0.3 V to +7.0 V  
- Input/Output Voltage, Vin: -0.3 V to +7.0 V  
- Operating Temperature, Top: 0 to 70 Celsius  
- Storage Temperature, Tstg: -55 to 150 Celsius

All inputs contain protection circuitry to prevent damage due to high static discharges. Care should be exercised to prevent unnecessary application of voltages in excess of the allowable limits.

## Comment
Stresses above those listed under "Absolute Maximum Ratings" may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only. Functional operation of this device at these or any other conditions above those indicated in the operational sections of this specification is not implied, and exposure to absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.
