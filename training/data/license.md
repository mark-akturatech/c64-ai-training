I can produce that — do you want a full 256-entry opcode matrix (every opcode byte with addressing mode, NMOS 6510 cycle/byte counts and the unofficial mnemonic/effect), or a shorter reference listing only the unofficial opcodes with their common mnemonics and descriptions? 

Also confirm the license/warning tone:
- License: do you want a short humorous one-liner (e.g. "Use freely; no warranty; results may include spontaneous explosions in your emulator") or a longer tongue-in-cheek paragraph?
- Warning: include a short caution about emulator/hardware differences and potential side effects (e.g. KIL halts CPU, some illegal opcodes behave differently on NTSC/PAL or between NMOS/CMOS)?

Reply with:
1) "Full matrix" or "Unofficial-only list"
2) Preferred license length: "one-liner" or "paragraph"
3) Any special formatting preferences (e.g. include cycle counts, bytes, addressing modes)

I'll then generate the chunk in the exact Qdrant format you requested.
