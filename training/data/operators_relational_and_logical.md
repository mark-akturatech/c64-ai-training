# COMMODORE 64 — ALGEBRAIC, RELATIONAL AND LOGICAL OPERATORS

**Summary:** Lists C64/BASIC algebraic operators (= assignment, ^, *, /, +, -), relational operators (=, <>, <, >, <=, >=) and logical operators (NOT, AND, OR). Notes that boolean expressions evaluate to 1 when true and 0 when false.

## Operators
Algebraic operators
- =  Assigns value to variable (LET X = 5)
- -  Negation (unary minus)
- ^  Exponentiation
- *  Multiplication
- /  Division
- +  Addition
- -  Subtraction

Relational and logical operators
- =   Equal (comparison)
- <>  Not equal to
- <   Less than
- >   Greater than
- <=  Less than or equal to
- >=  Greater than or equal to
- NOT Logical NOT
- AND Logical AND
- OR  Logical OR

Behavioral note
- Expressions used in relational/logical contexts evaluate to 1 if true, 0 if false.
