# COMMODORE 64 - Timbre and Sinusoidal Waveform

**Summary:** Introduces timbre and waveform; explains that timbre is determined primarily by waveform and shows a conceptual ASCII illustration of a sinusoidal (sine) wave. Searchable terms: timbre, waveform, sine wave.

## Description
Timbre is the tonal quality of a sound and is determined primarily by the waveform of the sound. The sinusoidal (sine) wave is the simplest waveform referenced here — visually depicted as evenly rippling oscillations (conceptual illustration provided).
