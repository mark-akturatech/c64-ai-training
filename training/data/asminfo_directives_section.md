# Kick Assembler: .asserterror and asserting code

**Summary:** Documentation for Kick Assembler's .asserterror directive (checks that an expression triggers an assembler error) and a note that .assert has a second form for comparing assembled code. Includes example showing a failing and a passing assertion and the assembler output/error text.

## .asserterror — purpose and behavior
.asserterror is a test/assertion directive that expects the given expression to produce an assembler error. If the expression does not cause an error, the assertion is reported as failed. If the expression does cause an assembler error, the assertion is reported OK and the assembler error message is shown.

- Typical use: verify that invalid expressions or misuse of directives/opcodes produce the expected assembler error.
- Failure mode: if the expression assembles successfully (no error), the assertion fails with "ERROR IN ASSERTION!".
- Success mode: if the expression triggers an assembler error, the assertion passes and the assembler's error message is displayed alongside the OK result.

**[Note: Source may contain an unclear/conflicting sentence about test1; clarified below.]**

## Asserting code (second form of .assert)
The assert directive also has a second form that compares pieces of assembled code (i.e., it can compare generated byte sequences or blocks of assembled output). The provided source is truncated at this point and does not include the exact syntax or examples for this second form.

**[Note: Source truncated — exact syntax and examples for the code-comparison form are not present in the source text.]**

## Source Code
```asm
; Directive listing format (from source):
; directive;example;description
; Example:
; .text;.text "hello";Dumps text bytes to memory.

; Example from source showing .asserterror usage:
.asserterror "Test2" , 20/false

; Explanation in source (clarified):
; - A test that attempts to divide 20 by 10 (e.g. .asserterror "Test1", 20/10) will FAIL
;   because dividing 20 by 10 is a legal operation and does not produce an assembler error.
; - The example .asserterror "Test2", 20/false produces the expected error (division by a boolean)
;   so that assertion passes.

; Expected assembler output shown in source:
; Test1 – ERROR IN ASSERTION!
; Test2 – OK. | Can’t get a numeric representation from a value of type boolean
```
