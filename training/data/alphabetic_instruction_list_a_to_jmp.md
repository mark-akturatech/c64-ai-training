# MCS6510 Instruction Summary — Alphabetic (ADC through JMP)

**Summary:** Compact alphabetic list of MCS6510 (6502-family) mnemonics and short English descriptions covering ADC through JMP. This is a terse mnemonic→description reference (no opcodes or addressing-mode details).

## Alphabetic list (ADC–JMP)
Compact two-column alphabetical summary of instructions and one-line descriptions, covering the first half of the MCS6510/6502 instruction alphabet from ADC through JMP. This list provides mnemonic and brief operation only (no opcode, cycles, or addressing-mode data).

BIT   Test Bits in Memory with Accumulator
BMI   Branch on Result Minus
BNE   Branch on Result not Zero
BPL   Branch on Result Plus
BRK   Force Break
BVC   Branch on Overflow Clear
BVS   Branch on Overflow Set

CLC   Clear Carry Flag
CLD   Clear Decimal Mode
