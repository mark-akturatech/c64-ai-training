# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos — References & Further Reading

**Summary:** Guidance for C-64 demo programmers to study demos and external references; focus on inspecting techniques such as chars vs sprites, scrolling, and realtime graphics updates. Encourages consulting magazines, articles, and an expanded list under "references_lines".

**Study Recommendations**

- **Learn by Inspection:** When watching a demo, identify which effects are implemented with character graphics (chars) and which use hardware sprites; note where smooth or hardware-assisted scrolling is used versus where the program updates bitmap/character data in real-time.
- **Focus on Techniques:** Dissecting techniques (chars, sprites, scrolling, real-time graphics updates) rather than just the visible effect yields reusable implementation ideas.
- **Consult External Documents:** Refer to magazines and articles for deeper technical coverage and implementation examples; many demo techniques were documented in periodicals and notes by demo authors.
- **Explore Demo Archives:** Study specific demos to understand the techniques they demonstrate.

**Recommended Documents and Magazine Articles**
