# Architecture of 6502 Microprocessor - Overflow Flag (V). Set when an arithmetic operation produces an invalid two's complement result — for example adding two positive numbers yielding a negative result (64 + 64 => -128). More generally: if the most significant bits of the two operands are the same and different from the msb of the result, V is set.


Overflow Flag 		V

The overflow flag is set during arithmetic operations if the result has yielded an invalid 2's complement result (e.g. adding two positive numbers and ending up with a negative result: 64 + 64 => -128). 

If the most significant bit of the two numbers being added is the same, and if it is different to the msb of the result, then the overflow flag will be set.
