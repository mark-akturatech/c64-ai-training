# COMMODORE 64 - VERIFY ["file-name"][,device]: compares contents of BASIC program file on tape or disk with program currently in memory (often used after SAVE). Default device 1 (cassette) if omitted. For tape if filename omitted compares next program found. For disk device 8 filename must be present. On mismatch ?VERIFY ERROR. Also used to position tape past last program. Examples of VERIFY operation and prompting (PRESS PLAY ON TAPE, FOUND, VERIFYING).

  VERIFY


  TYPE: Command
  FORMAT: VERIFY ["<file-name>"][,<device>]



  Action: The VERIFY command is used, in direct or program mode, to compare
  the contents of a BASIC program file on tape or disk with the program
  currently in memory. VERIFY is normally used right after a SAVE, to make
  sure that the program was stored correctly on tape or disk.
    If the <device> number is left out, the program is assumed to be on
  the Datassette(TM) which is device number 1. For tape files, if the
  <file-name> is left out, the next program found on the tape will be com-
  pared. For disk files (device number 8), the file-name must be present.
  If any differences in program text are found, the BASIC error message
  ?VERIFY ERROR is displayed.
    A program name can be given either in quotes or as a string variable.
  VERIFY is also used to position a tape just past the last program, so
  that a new program can be added to the tape without accidentally writing
  over another program.


  EXAMPLES of VERIFY Command:

    VERIFY                      (Checks 1st program on tape)
    PRESS PLAY ON TAPE
    OK
    SEARCHING
    FOUND <FILENAME>
    VERIFYING

    9000 SAVE "ME",8:
    9010 VERIFY "ME",8          (Looks at device 8 for the program)
