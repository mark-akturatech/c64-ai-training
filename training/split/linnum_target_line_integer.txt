# ********* - LINNUM ($14-$15): two-byte low/high integer used to store the target line number for GOTO, LIST, ON, and GOSUB, or the line number to add/replace. LIST saves the highest line to list (or $FFFF to indicate to end). Describes how GOTO determines search start (comparison uses most significant byte only—i.e., INT(TARGET/256) compared to INT(CURRENT/256)). Notes that PEEK, POKE, WAIT, and SYS use this location as a pointer address parameter.

Integer Line Number Value

The target line number for GOTO, LIST, ON, and GOSUB is stored here in
low- byte, high-byte integer format, as is the number of a BASIC line
that is to be added or replaced.

LIST saves the highest line number to list (or 65535 ($FFFF) if
program is to be listed to the end) at this location.

GOTO tests the target line number to see if it is greater than the
line number currently being executed.  If it is greater, GOTO starts
its search for the target line at the current line number.  If it is
not greater, GOTO must search for the target line from the first line
of the program.  It is interesting to note that the test is of the
most significant byte only.  Therefore, INT(TARGETLINE/256) must be
greater than INT(CURRENTLINE/256) in order for the search to start
with the current line, instead of at the beginning of the program.

PEEK, POKE, WAIT, and SYS use this location as a pointer to the
address which is the subject of the command.
