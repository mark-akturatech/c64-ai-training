# ********* - GONE ($A7E4) — Read and execute the next statement. Describes statement token fetching, vectoring through RAM at $308, placing execution address on the stack so CHRGET returns into the statement handler, and handling invalid tokens or implied LET when ASCII < 128.

42980         $A7E4          GONE
Read and Execute the Next Statement

This is the routine which gets the next token and executes the
statement.  It is vectored through RAM at 776 ($308) to allow the
addition and execution of new statement tokens.

Since a statement must always start with a token or an implied LET
statement, this routine checks to see if the first character is a
valid token.  If it is, the address is placed on the stack, so that a
call to CHRGET will return to the address of the code that executes
the statement (see the table of statement tokens at 40972 ($A00C)).

An invalid token will cause a SYNTAX ERROR.  A character whose ASCII
value is less that 128 will cause LET to be executed.
