# byRiclianll - Human-readable annotation for the DUPLICATE Single Sector 23 error variant (23B). Explains that this variant is identical to 23A.PAL except the checksum is left intact after reading a corrupted data block from the master. States where the sector and checksum are stored on the zero page/sector buffer: sector at $0400-$04FF, checksum at $003A. Explains that the checksum is not recalculated or incremented; the entire sector and its checksum are rewritten to the clone.

Duplicate  a  Single  Sector  23  Error  Source  Annotation 

Identical  to  the  23A.PAL  file  with  one  exception.  The  checksum  is  left  intact  after  a 
corrupted  data  block  is  read  from  the  master  using  the  job  queue.  The  sector  is  stored 
at  $0400-$04FF  and  the  checksum  at  $003A.  The  checksum  is  not  recalculated  or  in- 
cremented. The  entire  sector  and  its  checksum  are  rewritten  to  the  clone.
