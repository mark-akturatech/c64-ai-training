# ********* - Section 9.1: Software method to change the disk drive device number by writing new number into controller RAM via a MEMORY-WRITE sequence; includes example to change device number from 8 to 9 and notes about avoiding address conflicts when multiple drives are attached.




9. CHANGING THE DISK DRIVE DEVICE NUM[BER

9.1 SOFTWARE METHOD

The device number is selected by the drive by looking at a hardware
jumper on the board and writing the number based on that jumper in a
section of its RAM.  Once operation is underway, it is easy to write
over the previous device number with a new one.

FORMAT FOR CHANGING DEVICE NUMBER:

    PRINT#file#,"M-W:" CHR$(119) CHR$(0) CHR$(2) CHR$(address+32)
    CHR$(address+64)

EXAMPLE OF CHANGING DEVICE NUMBER (FROM 8 TO 9):

 10 OPEN 15, 8, 15
 20 PRINT# 15, "M-W" CHR$(119) CHR$(0) CHR$(2) CHR$(9+32)
    CHR$(9+64)

If you have more than one drive, it's sensible to change the address
through hardware (see below). If you must, the procedure is easy. Just
plug in the drives one at a time, and change their number to the
desired new values.  That way you won't have any conflicts.
