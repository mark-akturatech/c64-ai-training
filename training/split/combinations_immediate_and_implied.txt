# NMOS 6510 - Details of opcodes that combine an immediate operation with an implied instruction: ANE #{imm} (TXA + AND #{imm}), LAX #{imm} (LDA #{imm} + TAX), ANC #{imm} (AND #{imm} + ASL/ROL effect), ALR/ARR (AND + LSR/ROR combinations), SBX #{imm} (CMP + DEX), and SBC #{imm} combining SBC with NOP behavior. Notes that these put computed results into registers in combined ways (e.g., X = A & X - #{imm}).

put A & X minus #{imm} into X

SBC #{imm} SBC #{imm} + NOP
