# MACHINE - Exercises: clear the screen avoiding indirect,indexed, then write version using indirect,indexed; design addressing strategy for repeating a typed line ten times; rewrite routines without immediate addressing and consider pros/cons.



Questions and Projects
----------------------

Write a program to clear the screen of your computer--check Appendix C for
the location of screen memory if you've forgotten.  Don't just print the
clear screen character ($93); do it another way.  Can you write the entire
program without using indirect, indexed addressing?

Write the program again using indirect, indexed addressing.  The program may
be a little shorter.  Can you think of any other advantages of writing this
way?

A user wishes to type in a line of text on the keyboard, ending with a
RETURN.  He then wants to have the program repeat the line ten times on the
screen.  What addressing mode or modes would you use to handle the user's
text?  Why?  You may try your hand at writing the program if you wish.

Take one of the previous exercises and try to write it again without using
immediate addressing.  Is it hard to do?  Can you see any reason to want to
code without using immediate addressing at all?
