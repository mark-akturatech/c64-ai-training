# byRiclianll - Introduces the file-type byte (first byte) in a directory file entry. Begins the Commodore file types table, covering file types such as $00 (scratched), $80 (deleted), $81 (sequential), $82 (program/PRG), $83 (user/USR), $84 (relative/REL), and the unclosed variants ($01-$04) up through $03 entries. Explains that $82 indicates a PRG in examples.
