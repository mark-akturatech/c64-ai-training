# byRiclianll - Close/cleanup subroutine for the 'EDIT DISK NAME' program. Performs channel closure (CLOSE2), reads the drive command-channel status (INPUT#15, EN*, EM*, ET*, ES*), closes the command channel (CLOSE15) and ends the program. This handles orderly shutdown after attempts to read/write the BAM and disk name.
