# Commodore IEC Serial Bus Protocol Reference - pagetable.com - Low-level KERNAL calls for serial/IEEE bus operations: LISTEN $FFB1, UNLISTEN $FFAE, TALK $FFB4, UNTALK $FFAB, SECOND $FF93, TKSA $FF96, ACPTR $FFA5 (read byte), CIOUT $FFA8 (write byte). These take device/byte in A as documented.

KERNAL API Routines:

  Low-level IEEE/Serial Bus Calls:
    $FFB1  LISTEN    - Send LISTEN command with device number in A
    $FFAE  UNLISTEN  - Send UNLISTEN command
    $FFB4  TALK      - Send TALK command with device number in A
    $FFAB  UNTALK    - Send UNTALK command
    $FF93  SECOND    - Send secondary address after LISTEN (A = $60+SA)
    $FF96  TKSA      - Send secondary address after TALK (A = $60+SA)
    $FFA5  ACPTR     - Read byte from serial bus (returned in A)
    $FFA8  CIOUT     - Write byte to serial bus (A = byte to send)
