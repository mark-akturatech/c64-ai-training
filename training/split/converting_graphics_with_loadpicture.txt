# Kick Assembler - Explains LoadPicture to convert GIF/JPG to C64 formats. Examples: single color logo placement: *=$2000 .var logo = LoadPicture("CML_32x8.gif") .fill $800, logo.getSinglecolorByte((i>>3)&$1f, (i&7) | (i>>8)<<3). Shows alternative loops and using a color table (List().add(RGB values)) for multi-color conversion: .var picture = LoadPicture("Picture_16x16.gif", List().add($444444,$6c6c6c,$959595,$000000)) .fill $800, picture.getMulticolorByte(i>>7,i&$7f). Also mentions picture.getPixel(x,y) for extracting RGB.


Converts 4 pixels to a multi color byte using the color table. X is given as a byte number (= pixel position/8) and
y is given in pixels. (NB. This function ignores every
second pixel since the C64 multi color format is half the
resolution of the single color.)

12.5. Writing to User Defined Files
With the createFile function you can create/overwrite a file on the disk. You call it with a file name and it
returns a value that can be used to write data to the file:
.var myFile = createFile("breakpoints.txt")
.eval myFile.writeln("Hello World")

IMPORTANT! For security reasons, you will have to use the –afo switch on the command line otherwise file
generation will be blocked. Eg “java –jar KickAss.jar source.asm -afo” will do the trick.
File creation is useful for generating extra data for emulators. The following example shows how to generate
a file with breakpoint for VICE:
.var brkFile = createFile("breakpoints.txt")
.macro break() {
.eval brkFile.writeln(“break “ + toHexString(*))
}
*=$0801 “Basic”
BasicUpstart(start)
*=$1000 "Code"
start:
inc $d020
break()
jmp start

When running VICE with the breakpoint file (use the –moncommands switch), VICE will run until the break
and then exit to the monitor.
Here is a list of the functions on a file value:
