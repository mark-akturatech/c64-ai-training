# VIC-II Memory Banking and Address Configuration Guide - ROM character set shadow behaviour in banks 0 and 2:
- Bank 0: ROM charset is visible to the VIC-II at $1000-$1FFF (within bank 0)
- Bank 2: ROM charset is visible at $9000-$9FFF (within bank 2)

Because the ROM charset window occupies 4 KB in those banks, that region cannot be used for sprite data, custom character sets, or screen memory. Capacity comparisons:
- Banks 0 & 2 (with ROM shadow): 192 sprite shapes OR 12 text screens OR 6 custom charsets
- Banks 1 & 3 (full 16 KB): 256 sprite shapes OR 16 text screens OR 8 charsets

Also: in banks 0 and 2 the lower half of a hi-res bitmap may be obscured by the ROM charset region.

ROM Character Set Shadows
--------------------------

Banks 0 and 2 contain ROM character set shadows. The VIC-II chip maps the
standard ROM character set into a 4 KB region of these banks:

  - Bank 0: ROM charset visible at $1000-$1FFF
  - Bank 2: ROM charset visible at $9000-$9FFF

This means in banks 0 and 2, the standard character set is directly available
to the VIC-II without needing to copy it into RAM. However, this comes at a
cost: those 4 KB regions cannot be used for sprite data, custom character
sets, or screen memory.

Capacity comparison:

  Banks 0 and 2 (with ROM charset shadow):
    - 192 sprite shapes, OR
    - 12 text screens, OR
    - 6 custom character sets

  Banks 1 and 3 (full 16 KB available):
    - 256 sprite shapes, OR
    - 16 text screens, OR
    - 8 character sets

Additionally, in banks 0 and 2, the lower half of a high-resolution bitmap
screen is partially obscured by the ROM character image region.
