# ********* - BLNSW ($CC), BLNCT ($CD), GDBLN ($CE), BLNON ($CF) — Cursor blink control and state. Covers BLNSW (cursor blink enable/disable: nonzero disables blink; guidance to POKE 204,0 to force blinking during programs), BLNCT (blink countdown timer that counts down from 20 every jiffy to produce ~3 blinks/sec), GDBLN (stores the normal screen code of the character under the cursor so it can be restored), and BLNON (tracks whether the cursor's current blink shows reversed or normal character: 0=reversed, 1=normal).

Cursor Blink Enable: 0=Flash Cursor

When this flag is set to a nonzero value, it indicates to the routine
that normally flashes the cursor not to do so.  The cursor blink is
turned off when there are characters in the keyboard buffer, or when
the program is running.

You can use this location to turn the cursor on during a program (for
a series of GET operations, for example, to show the user that input
is expected) by using the statement POKE 204,0.

Timer: Countdown to Blink Cursor

The interrupt routine that blinks the cursor uses this location to
tell when it's time for a blink.  First the number 20 is put here, and
every jiffy (1/60 second) the value here is decreased by one, until it
reaches zero.  Then the cursor is blinked, the number 20 is put back
here, and the cycle starts all over again.  Thus, under normal
circumstances, the cursor blinks three times per second.

Character Under Cursor

The cursor is formed by printing the inverse of the character that
occupies the cursor position.  If that characters is the letter A, for
example, the flashing cursor merely alternates between printing an A
and a reverse-A.  This location keeps track of the normal screen code
of the character that is located at the cursor position, so that it
may be restored when the cursor moves on.

207           $CF            BLNON
Flag: Was Last Curson Blink on or off?

This location keeps track of whether, during the current cursor blink,
the character under the cursor was reversed, or was restored to
normal.  This location will contain a 0 if the character is reversed,
and a 1 if the character is restored to its nonreversed status.
