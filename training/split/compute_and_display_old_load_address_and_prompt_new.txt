# byRiclianll - Compute the old two-byte load address from the LOW and HIGH bytes read from the buffer. Calls a conversion subroutine (GOSUB 1010) to turn a byte value into a two-character hex string (HD*), accumulates OLA* (old load address) from HIGH and LOW bytes, prints the old load address, prompts for a new four-character hex load address (NLA*), and validates the entered length (must be 4).
