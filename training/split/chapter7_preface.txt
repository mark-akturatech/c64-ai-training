# MACHINE - Preface: encouragement to review fundamentals and note that following chapters provide fine tuning; good time to ensure comfort with basics before tackling advanced topics.

A Brief Intermission
--------------------

If you have been following along and performing the various projects, you
should know a great deal about the principles of machine language.  You
should be capable of trying your hand at a number of small projects, and
investigating areas that may be of special interest.

This is a good time to stop and take stock.  The remaining chapters are
"icing on the cake" ... they give extra detail and fine tuning on aspects of
machine language.  If you feel uncertain about any material covered so far,
go back.  Fix the fundamentals firmly in focus before you proceed and plunge
into ponderous points of interest.
