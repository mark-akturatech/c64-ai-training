# Multidirectional Scrolling Techniques by Cadaver - Shifting screen-memory with doublebuffering: copying from currently visible screen to the hidden screen avoids overwriting source data. Use X as source index and Y as target index and adjust initial indices to achieve all 8 directions. Need two actual loops (screen1->screen2 and screen2->screen1).

2.3 Shifting the screen-memory data

In fact doublebuffering also makes it easier to code the screen shifting. If
one is working only on one screen one must be careful in what direction the
shifting loops should go, to not wipe out the entire screen data. Not so with
doublebuffering, because the screen data is always being copied from the
currently visible screen to the other, hidden screen. If one uses the X register
index for the source and Y for the target, all 8 directions can be achieved by
simply adjusting the initial index register values. (Naturally one needs two
actual shifting loops, one for screen1->screen2 and one for screen2->screen1)
