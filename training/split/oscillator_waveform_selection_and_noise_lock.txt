# COMMODORE 64 - Behavior of SID oscillator waveform selection: waveform outputs are not additive but logically ANDed when multiple waveforms are selected; this can produce additional waveforms but must be used with care. Interaction with Noise: selecting other waveforms with Noise on can cause the Noise output to 'lock up' (remain silent) until reset by the TEST bit or by bringing RES (pin 5) low. Includes surrounding appendix header/spacing lines for context.


  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | NOTE: The oscillator output waveforms are NOT additive. If more than  |
  | one output waveform is selected simultaneously, the result will be a  |
  | logical ANDing of the waveforms. Although this technique can be used  |
  | to generate additional waveforms beyond the four listed above, it must|
  | be used with care. If any other waveform is selected while Noise is   |
  | on, the Noise output can "lock up " If this occurs, the Noise output  |
  | will remain silent until reset by the TEST bit or by bringing RES     |
  | (pin 5) low.                                                          |
