# byRiclianll - Begins a long section of tokenized patterns and short two-letter groups: repeated 'r' motifs (r  r, riri, r»ri), UU runs, and combinations of nn, ou, OU, 00. This region shows interleaving of repeated tokens (visual/ASCII stand-ins for byte values) and 00 padding — typical of raw sector dumps with repeated filler and metadata markers.
