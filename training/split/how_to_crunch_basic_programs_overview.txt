# COMMODORE 64 - Introduction to program 'crunching' techniques to shorten BASIC programs: motivations (save memory, leave more RAM for data), and general approaches overview (abbreviations, line number shortening, multiple statements per line, REM removal).


  HOW TO CRUNCH BASIC PROGRAMS

  You can pack more instructions - and power - into your BASIC programs by
  making each program as short as possible. This process of shortening
  programs is called "crunching."
    Crunching programs lets you squeeze the maximum possible number of
  instructions into your program. It also helps you reduce the size of
  programs which might not otherwise run in a given size; and if you're
  writing a program which requires the input of data such as inventory
  items, numbers or text, a short program will leave more memory space free
  to hold data.

  ABBREVIATING KEYWORDS

    A list of keyword abbreviations is given in Appendix A. This is helpful
  when you program because you can actually crowd more information on each
  line using abbreviations. The most frequently used abbreviation is

  the question mark (?) which is the BASIC abbreviation for the PRINT
  command. However, if you LIST a program that has abbreviations, the
  Commodore 64 will automatically print out the listing with the full-
  length keywords. If any program line exceeds 80 characters (2 lines on
  the screen) with the keywords unabbreviated, and you want to change it,
  you will have to re-enter that line with the abbreviations before saving
  the program. SAVEing a program incorporates the keywords without
  inflating any lines because BASIC keywords are tokenized by the Commodore
  64. Usually, abbreviations are added after a program is written and it
  isn't going to be LISTed any more before SAVEing.
