# COMMODORE 64 - BIT — Test bits in memory with accumulator. Shows operation (A /\ M, M7 -> N, M6 -> V), describes transfer of bits 6 and 7 into N and V, effect on Z flag, manual reference (Ref: 4.2.1.1), and addressing-mode table entries for Zero Page and Absolute with opcodes, bytes and cycles.

  BIT             BIT Test bits in memory with accumulator              BIT

  Operation:  A /\ M, M7 -> N, M6 -> V

  Bit 6 and 7 are transferred to the status register.   N Z C I D V
  If the result of A /\ M is zero then Z = 1, otherwise M7/ _ _ _ M6
  Z = 0
