# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Wrapper at $FFA8 that JMPs to $EDDD to output a byte to the serial bus with full handshaking. LISTEN must be used before calling. Buffers one character and handles EOI on UNLISTEN.

                                *** output a byte to serial bus
                                this routine is used to send information to devices on the serial bus. A call to
                                this routine will put a data byte onto the serial bus using full handshaking.
                                Before this routine is called the LISTEN routine, $FFB1, must be used to
                                command a device on the serial bus to get ready to receive data.
                                the accumulator is loaded with a byte to output as data on the serial bus. A
                                device must be listening or the status word will return a timeout. This routine
                                always buffers one character. So when a call to the UNLISTEN routine, $FFAE,
                                is made to end the data transmission, the buffered character is sent with EOI
                                set. Then the UNLISTEN command is sent to the device.
