# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - VIC-II bank/block 1 description (16384-32767 / Block 1): normally used for BASIC program storage. Advantages: VIC-II does not see character generator ROM here so the block is open for sprite shapes, character graphics, and bitmap graphics provided BASIC top-of-memory is adjusted. Drawbacks: BASIC program space limited and character ROM unavailable (can copy ROM to RAM).

                          Block 1.  Block 1 is normally used for BASIC program storage.  When
                          using this bank, the VIC-II does not have access to the character
                          generator ROM.  Providing that you lower the top of memory so that
                          BASIC programs do not interfere, this area is wide open for sprite
                          shapes, character graphics, and bitmap graphics.

                          The drawbacks to using this bank are the unavailability of the
                          character ROM and the limitation on BASIC program space (as little as
                          14K).  The absence of the character ROM is a relatively minor
                          nuisance, because you can always switch in the ROM and copy any or all
                          of the characters to RAM (see the entries for location 1 and the
                          alternate entry for 53248 ($D000), the Character ROM, for details).
                          This block may be a good alternate choice to avoid potential conflicts
                          with other applications that use higher memory.
