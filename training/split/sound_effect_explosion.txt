# SID 6581/8580 Sound Interface Device - Programming Guide - Explosion example: short ADSR (A=0,D=0; S=15,R=9), low frequency ($D401 low), noise + gate ($D404 = $81), optional filter cutoff sweep down for extra effect.

EXPLOSION:
  lda #$00          // A=0, D=0
  sta $d405
  lda #$f9          // S=15, R=9
  sta $d406
  lda #$10          // Low frequency for rumble
  sta $d401
  lda #$81          // Noise + gate
  sta $d404
  ; Optionally sweep filter cutoff down for extra effect
