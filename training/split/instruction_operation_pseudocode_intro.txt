# 6502 Microprocessor - Pseudocode introduction and helper macros used in the following instruction operation snippets: src, SET_SIGN, SET_ZERO, SET_CARRY, SET_OVERFLOW, SET_INTERRUPT, SET_BREAK, SET_DECIMAL, REL_ADDR, SET_SR, GET_SR, PULL, PUSH, LOAD, STORE, IF_* macros, clk, and register aliases (AC, XR, YR, PC, SP).

INSTRUCTION OPERATION

 The following code has been taken from VICE for the purposes of showing
how each instruction operates. No particular addressing mode is used since
we only wish to see the operation of the instruction itself. 

     src : the byte of data that is being addressed.
     SET_SIGN : sets\resets the sign flag depending on bit 7.
     SET_ZERO : sets\resets the zero flag depending on whether the result
                is zero or not.
     SET_CARRY(condition) : if the condition has a non-zero value then the
                carry flag is set, else it is reset.
     SET_OVERFLOW(condition) : if the condition is true then the overflow
                flag is set, else it is reset.
     SET_INTERRUPT :  }
     SET_BREAK :      }  As for SET_CARRY and SET_OVERFLOW.
     SET_DECIMAL :    }
     REL_ADDR(PC, src) : returns the relative address obtained by adding
                the displacement src to the PC.
     SET_SR : set the Program Status Register to the value given.
     GET_SR : get the value of the Program Status Register.
     PULL : Pull a byte off the stack.
     PUSH : Push a byte onto the stack.
     LOAD : Get a byte from the memory address.
     STORE : Store a byte in a memory address.
     IF_CARRY, IF_OVERFLOW, IF_SIGN, IF_ZERO etc : Returns true if the
                relevant flag is set, otherwise returns false.
     clk : the number of cycles an instruction takes. This is shown below
                in situations where the number of cycles changes depending
                on the result of the instruction (eg. Branching instructions).

     AC = Accumulator
     XR = X register
     YR = Y register
     PC = Program Counter
     SP = Stack Pointer
