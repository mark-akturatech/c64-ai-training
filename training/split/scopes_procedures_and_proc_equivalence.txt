# ca65 Users Guide - Nested procedures via .PROC: they create a named nested lexical level, add a symbol in the enclosing scope, and are equivalent to label plus .SCOPE. Example shows .proc foo ... .endproc equals foo: .scope foo ... .endscope.

7.4 Nested procedures
A nested procedure is created by use of .PROC. It differs from a .SCOPE in that it must have a name, and a it will introduce a symbol with this name in the enclosing scope. So


        .proc   foo
                ...
        .endproc
is actually the same as


        foo:
        .scope  foo
                ...
        .endscope
This is the reason why a procedure must have a name. If you want a scope without a name, use .SCOPE.

Note: As you can see from the example above, scopes and symbols live in different namespaces. There can be a symbol named foo and a scope named foo without any conflicts (but see the section titled "Scope search order").
