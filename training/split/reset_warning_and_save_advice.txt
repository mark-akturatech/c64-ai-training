# Contents - Consequences and safety advice when disabling the OS: after running a program that disables the C64 operating system (disabling keyboard scan routines), you cannot reset the machine normally — you must power-cycle it. Warning to always save your program and source code before running new programs that take over interrupts.


After running this program, you can not reset 
the Commodore 64. By disabling the operating 
system, you have disabled the keyboard scan 
routines, effectively making the computer deaf to 
outside stimuli. When you have finished watching 
your new program and want to reset the machine, 
turn it off and back on again. 

Warning: Always be sure that you have saved your 
program and source code before trying to run a new 
program!
