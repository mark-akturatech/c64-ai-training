# MACHINE - VIC-20 overview: new design with color/graphics/sound, changed memory architecture and zero page layout; BASIC similar to Upgrade ROM; no built-in monitor (must load one); SYS command allows preloading A/X/Y via POKE into addresses 780/781/782; warns about location variability depending on memory expansion.


VIC-20
------

The VIC-20 was a new design concept for Commodore.  Color, graphics, and
sound were built into the computer.  The memory architecture changed
radically.  Zero-page locations were shifted significantly as compared to
previous PET/CBM computers.

BASIC reverted to Upgrade ROM style--no special disk commands and potentially
slow garbage collection.  Other than that, BASIC was not trimmed.  All the
functions and features remained, and some attractive new screen editing
features were added, such as automatic repeating keys.

The VIC comes with no machine language monitor; it's necessary to load one.
The SYS command has a new attractive feature that allows registers A, X, and
Y to be "preloaded" by POKEing values into address 780, 781, and 782.
Location 783 could also be used to set the status register, but that's
dangerous; unless it's done carefully, the decimal mode or interrupt disable
flags might be set inadvertently.

The VIC-20 is somewhat vexing for machine language programming work.
Depending on the amount of extra memory fitted (none, 3K, or 8K and over),
the location of start-of-BASIC and of screen memory will vary.
