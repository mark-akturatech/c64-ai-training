# C64 KERNAL API (Lee Davison) - $FFA5 — Input a byte from the serial bus (full handshaking). Reads a data byte returned in A. Requires a prior TALK call ($FFB4). If the device needs a secondary command, send it with TKSA ($FF96) before calling this routine. Errors are returned via status word (READST $FFB7).

$FFA5          input byte from serial bus
               
               This routine reads a byte of data from the serial bus using full handshaking. the
               data is returned in the accumulator. before using this routine the TALK routine,
               $FFB4, must have been called first to command the device on the serial bus to
               send data on the bus. if the input device needs a secondary command it must be sent
               by using the TKSA routine, $FF96, before calling this routine.
               
               Errors are returned in the status word which can be read by calling the READST
               routine, $FFB7.
