# byRiclianll - COPY command can append multiple sequential data files into one target file using syntax: PRINT#15,"CO:COMBINED=0:FILE1,0:FILE2,0:FILE3". While available, merging files this way is rarely used and cannot append a subroutine into a BASIC program (use third-party tools to merge into BASIC).

It  is  also  possible  to  merge  two  or  more  sequential  data  files  using  the  copy  command. 
The  syntax  for  this  is  as  follows: 

SYNTAX: 

OPEN   15,    8,  15 

PRINT#15,    "CO: COMBINED=0: FILEl , O: FILE2, 

0:FILE3" 
CLOSE  15 


23 


alternate: 

PRINT#15,  "C: C0MBINED=FILE1 , FILE2, FILES- 
EXAMPLE: 

OPEN   15,    8,  15 

PR I NT# 1 5 ,    " CO :  M A I LF I LE=0 : NAME , O : ADDRESS , 

O: CITY" 
CLOSE  15 


DOS  5. 1 : 

CO : COMB I NED=0 : F I LE 1 , 0 : F I LE2 , O : F I LE3 
>C : COMB I NED=F I LE 1 , F I LE2 , F I LE3 

Our  large  file  now  consists  of  several  files  appended  together.  While  this  feature  of  the 
copy  command  is  available,  it  is  rarely  used.  Few  programming  techniques  would  re- 
quire or  ever  utilize  this  feature.  Note  that  this  technique  cannot  be  used  to  append 
a  subroutine  onto  a  BASIC  program;  the  subroutine  cannot  be  merged  into  the  main 
program  by  the  disk  drive.  You  will  need  to  use  a  programmer's  aid  like  POWER™, 
SYSRES™,  or  BASIC  AID™  for  the  C64  to  do  this.
