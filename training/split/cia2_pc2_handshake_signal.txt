# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - CIA #2 PC (PC2 / handshaking) behavior: On CIA #2, the PC line is connected and accessible from the User Port. The PC2 line goes low for one cycle after a read or write of Port B, signaling external devices that data was read/written (handshaking).

                          One of the handshaking lines on the above chart, PC2, was not covered
                          in the discussion of CIA #1, because that line of CIA #1 is not
                          connected to anything.  The CIA #2 PC line is accessible from the User
                          Port, however.  This line will go low for one cycle following a read
                          or write of Port B on CIA #2.  This signal lets external devices know
                          when data has been read or written.
