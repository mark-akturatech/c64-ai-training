# Multidirectional Scrolling Techniques by Cadaver - Overview of the map-data & block-data (tile) system used in many C64 tools (e.g., SEUCK). States map data are 8-bit block numbers allowing up to 256 blocks and that the rant assumes familiarity with this system.

1. The map-data and the block-data

It would probably take too much memory to store each screen of a game world as
only the character codes, without any encoding. However, Chris Butler's
Commando and Ghosts'n Goblins do just fine by doing things this way, so it's
not entirely unusable.

The popular method of graphics encoding seen in for example SEUCK is the map-
data & block-data system (sometimes the blocks are also called tiles.) The
rest of this rant assumes you're familiar with this system.
