# ********* - NEXT ($AD1E) — Perform NEXT: finds corresponding FOR data on the stack, adds STEP to the FOR variable, compares to TO; if loop finished removes FOR stack entries, otherwise restores pointers from FOR stack entry so execution continues after the FOR statement.

Perform NEXT

NEXT is executed by finding the appropriate FOR data on the stack,
adding the STEP value to the FOR variable, and comparing the result to
the TO value.  If the loop is done, the stack entries for that FOR
command are removed from the stack.  If the loop hasn't reached its
limit, the pointers to the current statement and text character are
updated from the FOR stack entry, which causes execution to continue
with the statement after the FOR statement.
