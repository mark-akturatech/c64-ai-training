# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - INIT: BASIC cold-start routine vectored at the BASIC ROM entry. Performs the full initialization sequence: calls initialization helper $E453, runs BASIC initialization at $E3BF, outputs the power-up message via $E422, resets the stack pointer to #$FB (TXS), then branches to the warm-start path to output READY and restart BASIC. Key operations: JSR $E453, JSR $E3BF, JSR $E422, LDX #$FB / TXS, BNE to warm-start continuation.

                                *** INIT: BASIC COLD START
                                This is the BASIC cold start routine that is vectored at
                                the very start of the BASIC ROM. BASIC vectors and
                                variables are set up, and power-up message is output, and
                                BASIC is restarted.
