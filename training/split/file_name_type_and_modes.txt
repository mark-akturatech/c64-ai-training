# COMMODORE 64 - Explains the <file-name> (1–16 characters) and when it is optional (cassette or printer). Describes default file type (Program) if <type> is omitted unless <mode> is given. Describes modes: sequential files default to read (<mode>=R) unless <mode>=W for writing. States that <type>=REL is used for Relative files; Relative and Sequential files are disk-only.

    The <file-name> is a string of 1-16 characters and is optional for
  cassette or printer files. If the file <type> is left out the type of
  file will automatically default to the Program file unless the <mode> is
  given.
  Sequential files are OPENed for reading <mode>=R unless you specify that
  files should be OPENed for writing <mode> =W is specified. A file <type>
  can be used to OPEN an existing Relative file. Use REL for <type> with
  Relative files. Relative and Sequential files are for disk only.
