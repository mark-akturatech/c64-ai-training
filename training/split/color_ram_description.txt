# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $D800-$DBFF — Color RAM: 1KB area (1000 used) controlling foreground color per character (low 4 bits only). Reading requires masking high bits (AND 15). Provides enumerated color table 0..15 mapping to names (BLACK, WHITE, RED, CYAN, ... LIGHT GRAY).

$D800-$DBFF               Color RAM

                          The normal Commodore 64 text graphics system uses a screen RAM area to
                          keep track of the character shapes that are to be displayed.  But
                          since each character can be displayed in any of 16 foreground colors,
                          there must also be a parallel area which keeps track of the foreground
                          color.  This 1024-byte area is used for that purpose (actually, since
                          there are only 1000 screen positions, only 1000 byte actually affect
                          screen color).

                          These 1000 bytes each control the foreground color of one character,
                          with the first byte controlling the foreground color of the character
                          in the upper- left corner, and subsequent bytes controlling the
                          characters to the right and below that character.

                          Because only four bits are needed to represent the 16 colors
                          available, only the low four bits of each Color RAM location are
                          connected (this is why they are sometimes referred to as Color RAM
                          Nybbles).  Writing to the high bits will not affect them, and these
                          four bits will usually return a random value when read (a small number
                          of 64s return a constant value).

                          Therefore, in order to read Color RAM correctly, you must mask out the
                          top bits by using the logical AND function.  In BASIC, you can read
                          the first byte of Color RAM with the statement CR=PEEK(55296)AND15.
                          This will always return a color value between 0 and 15.  These color
                          values correspond to the following colors:

                          |   |                         |
                          |---|-------------------------|
                          | 0 | BLACK		   |
                          | 1 | WHITE		   |
                          | 2 | RED			   |
                          | 3 | CYAN (LIGHT BLUE-GREEN) |
                          | 4 | PURPLE		   |
                          | 5 | GREEN		   |
                          | 6 | BLUE			   |
                          | 7 | YELLOW		   |
                          | 8 | ORANGE		   |
                          | 9 | BROWN		   |
                          |10 | LIGHT RED		   |
                          |11 | DARK GRAY		   |
                          |12 | MEDIUM GRAY		   |
                          |13 | LIGHT GREEN		   |
                          |14 | LIGHT BLUE		   |
                          |15 | LIGHT GRAY		   |
