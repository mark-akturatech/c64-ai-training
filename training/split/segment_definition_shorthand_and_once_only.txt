# Kick Assembler - Explains shorthand of defining a segment and creating a default memory block at the same time by adding parameter block to .segment (e.g., .segment MySegment [start=$1000]) which is equivalent to .segmentdef MySegment [start=$1000] then .segment MySegment. Notes a segment can only be defined once.

10.6. Naming memory blocks while switching segment
One use of segments is to place code/data that is tied together but should be located different places in memory,
close together in the source code. This leads to a coding style where you may want to name a new block of code
every time you switch segment. You could do this by adding a memblock directive right after the segment directive.
But as a convenient shorthand you can just place a text string after the segment switch:
