# byRiclianll - Loop that sends the 'M-R' command bytes to the device. Includes an LDX initialization (shown as '#*00'), the loop label LOOPl, the instruction 'LDA MR,X' with the inline comment '; SEND M-R COMMAND' (reading command bytes from the MR table), and the call to a character-send routine (JSR) to transmit each byte. This region is the command-transmit loop that iterates over MR,X until the command sequence is sent.
