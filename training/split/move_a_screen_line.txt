# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - Moves a single screen line down (character-by-character) and moves the corresponding colour bytes. First calls synchronise_colour_transfer to set up colour pointers, then loops over 40 characters copying screen RAM from ($AC) to ($D1) and colour RAM from ($AE) to ($F3).

                                *** MOVE A SCREEN LINE
                                This routine synchronises colour transfer, and then moves
                                the screen line pointed to down, character by character.
                                The colour codes for each character are also moved in the
                                same way.
