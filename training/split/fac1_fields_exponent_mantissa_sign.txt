# ********* - Detailed layout of FAC1 subfields: FACEXP ($61) — exponent stored with bias of 129 (128 represents zero); FACHO ($62-$65) — four-byte normalized mantissa (MSB assumed 1), with first two bytes also used as signed integer result in high/low order; FACSGN ($66) — sign byte (0 = positive, $FF = negative).

Floating Point Accumulator #1 can be further divided into the
following locations:

97            $61            FACEXP
Floating Point Accumulator #1: Exponent

This exponent represents the closest power of two to the number, with
129 added to take care of the sign problem for negative exponents.  An
exponent of 128 is used for the value 0; an exponent of 129 represents
2 to the 0 power, or 1; an exponent of 130 represents 2 to the first
power, or 2; 131 is 2 squared, or 4; 132 is 2 cubed, or 8; and so on.

98-101        $62-$65        FACHO
Floating Point Accumulator #1: Mantissa

The most significant digit can be assumed to be a 1 (remember that the
range of the mantissa is from 1 to 1.99999...) when a floating point
number is stored to a variable.  The first bit is used for the sign of
the number, and the other 31 bits of the four-byte mantissa hold the
other significant digits.

The first two bytes (98-99, $62-$63) of this location will hold the
signed integer result of a floating point to integer conversion, in
high-byte, low- byte order.

102           $66            FACSGN
Floating Point Accumulator #1: Sign

A value of 0 here indicates a positive number, while a value of 255
($FF) indicates a negative number.
