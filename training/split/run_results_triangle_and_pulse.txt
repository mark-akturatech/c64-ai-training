# COMMODORE 64 - Instructions to RUN the modified program and observations about how the sound quality changes (sawtooth -> triangle), includes ASCII illustrations of the triangular waveform and the variable pulse (rectangular) waveform and labels showing pulse width.

    Notice how the sound quality is different, less twangy, more hollow.
  That's because we changed the sawtooth waveform into a triangular
  waveform (shown left). The third musical waveform is called a variable
  pulse wave (shown right).
