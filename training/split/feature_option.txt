--feature name
Enable an emulation feature. This is identical as using .FEATURE in the source with two exceptions: Feature names must be lower case, and each feature must be specified by using a separate --feature option, comma separated lists are not allowed.

See the discussion of the .FEATURE command for a list of emulation features.
