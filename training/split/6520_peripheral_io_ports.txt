# MACHINE - 6520 Peripheral I/O Ports operation: each peripheral I/O line programmable as input or output via DDR bits; '1' means output, '0' means input. Typically set during reset but can be changed dynamically for device control.

Peripheral I/O Ports
--------------------

Each of the Peripheral I/O lines can be programmed to act as an input or an
output.  This is accomplished by setting a "1" in the corresponding bit in
the Data Direction Register for those lines which are to act as outputs.  A
"0" in a bit of the Data Direction Register causes the corresponding
Peripheral I/O lines to act as an input.
