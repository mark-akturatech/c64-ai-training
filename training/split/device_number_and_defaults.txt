# COMMODORE 64 - Describes the <device> number for each peripheral (printer, disk drive, cassette) and the concept of secondary addresses (codes telling devices what operation to perform). States that the device logical file number is used with GET#, INPUT#, and PRINT#. Explains default behavior: if <device> is omitted it defaults to Datassette (device 1); filename can be omitted but then cannot be referenced by name later; omitting secondary address for cassette defaults to 0 (READ).



    Each peripheral device (printer, disk drive, cassette) in the system
  has its own number which it answers to. The <device> number is used with
  OPEN to specify on which device the data file exists. Peripherals like
  cassette decks, disk drives or printers also answer to several secondary
  addresses. Think of these as codes which tell each device what operation
  to perform. The device logical file number is used with every GET#,
  INPUT#, and PRINT#.
    If the <device> number is left out the computer will automatically
  assume that you want your information to be sent to and received from
  the Datassette(TM), which is device number 1. The file-name can also be
  left out, but later on in your program, you can NOT call the file by name
  if you have not already given it one. When you are storing files on cas-
  sette tape, the computer will assume that the secondary <address> is
  zero (0) if you omit the secondary address (a READ operation).
