# MACHINE - Appendix C heading: introduction to memory maps, advice about their limitations (too big/too small), guidance for beginners and advanced programmers, and that POKE/PEEK locations should be checked in the maps that follow.

                                                                        :160:

A word about memory maps:  they are always too big or too small for the use
you have in mind.

The beginner may feel swamped by the wealth of detail.  There's no threat,
however.  The information is there when you're ready for it.  Browse through
the information; it may be though-provoking.  Try reading or changing
locations to see what happens.

The advanced programmer may want more:  lengthy details on how each location
is used, which parts of the system use these locations, and so on.  Time and
space don't permit such detail.

The maps are intended to be fairly complete.  Those who want more detail may
find them cryptic; but at least each location will be associated with a type
of activity.  Different machines may be compared by checking their respective
maps.  In some cases, programs may be converted with their use, since they
will help to find the corresponding memory location in the target machine.
