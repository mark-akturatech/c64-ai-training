# MACHINE - CRTC Registers R10 (Cursor Start) and R11 (Cursor End) — 5-bit registers to select starting and ending scan lines for the cursor. Bits 6 and 5 of R10 select cursor mode (no blinking, no cursor, blink at 1/16 field rate, blink at 1/32 field rate). R14/R15 control the cursor character position over the address field.

Cursor Start (R10) and Cursor End (R11)
---------------------------------------

These 5-bit registers select the starting and ending scan lines for the
cursor.  In addition, bits 5 and 6 of R10 are used to select the cursor mode,
as follows:


                     +-------+--------------------------+
                     |  BIT  |       CURSOR MODE        |
                     | 6   5 |                          |
                     +---+---+--------------------------+
                     | 0 | 0 | No Blinking              |
                     | 0 | 1 | No Cursor                |
                     | 1 | 0 | Blink at 1/16 field rate |
                     | 1 | 1 | Blink at 1/32 field rate |
                     +---+---+--------------------------+

Note that the ability to program both the start and end scan line for the
cursor enables either block cursor or underline to be accommodated.
Registers R14 and R15 are used to control the character position of the
cursor over the entire 16K address field.
