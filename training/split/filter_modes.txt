# SID 6581/8580 Sound Interface Device - Programming Guide - Filter modes described: Low-pass (LP, bit4 $D418), Band-pass (BP, bit5), High-pass (HP, bit6). Effects on tone and combined mode behaviors: LP+HP (notch), LP+BP, HP+BP, LP+BP+HP (all-pass/phase shift).

7.1 FILTER MODES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LOW-PASS FILTER (Bit 4 of $D418):
  Passes frequencies BELOW the cutoff frequency and attenuates frequencies
  above it. The rolloff is 12 dB/octave. Useful for creating warm, muffled
  tones and simulating the natural frequency response of acoustic instruments.

BAND-PASS FILTER (Bit 5 of $D418):
  Passes a narrow band of frequencies AROUND the cutoff frequency and
  attenuates all others. Produces a nasal, "wah-wah" quality. Sweeping the
  cutoff frequency produces classic filter sweep effects.

HIGH-PASS FILTER (Bit 6 of $D418):
  Passes frequencies ABOVE the cutoff frequency and attenuates frequencies
  below it. Produces thin, "tinny" sounds. Lower tones are reduced in volume.

COMBINED MODES:
  Multiple filter mode bits can be set simultaneously:

  LP + HP (Notch/Band-Reject):
    Attenuates frequencies near the cutoff while passing those above and below.
    Creates a "phasing" quality.

  LP + BP:
    Wider low-pass rolloff with a resonance emphasis.

  HP + BP:
    Wider high-pass rolloff with a resonance emphasis.

  LP + BP + HP:
    Approximates an all-pass filter (phase shifting effect).
