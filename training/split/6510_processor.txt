# The MOS 6567/6569 video controller (VIC-II) and its application in the Commodore 64 - Description of the 6510 (6502-family) CPU used in the C64: 8-bit data bus, 16-bit address bus, clock frequencies (NTSC 1022.7 kHz, PAL 985.248 kHz), two-phase clock (φ2), important signals (φ2, R/W, IRQ, RDY, AEC) and the built-in 6-bit I/O port (P0-P5 mapped at addresses $0000/$0001). Notes on RDY/AEC interaction with VIC (bus arbitration).

2.2. 6510 processor
-------------------

The 6510 microprocessor [1] has an 8 bit data bus and a 16 bit address bus
and is object code compatible with the famous 6502. It has two external
interrupt inputs (one maskable (IRQ) and one non-maskable (NMI)) and as a
special feature a 6 bit wide bidirectional I/O port. It is clocked at 1MHz
in the C64.

Important signals:

�2     Processor clock output
       This clock signal is the reference for the complete bus timing. Its
       frequency is 1022.7 kHz (NTSC models) or 985.248 kHz (PAL models).
       One period of this signal corresponds to one clock cycle consisting
       of two phases: �2 is low in the first phase and high in the second
       phase (hence the name '�2' for "phase 2"). The 6510 only accesses
       the bus in the second clock phase, the VIC normally only in the
       first phase.

R/W    This signal flags a read (R/W high) or write (R/W low) access.

IRQ    If this input is held on low level, an interrupt sequence is
       triggered unless interrupts are masked with the interrupt mask bit
       in the status register. The interrupt sequence begins after two
       or more clock cycles at the start of the next instruction. With this
       pin, the VIC can trigger an interrupt in the processor. Interrupts
       are only recognized if the RDY line is high.

RDY    If this line is low during a read access, the processor stops with
       the address lines reflecting the current address being fetched. It
       is ignored during write accesses. In the C64, RDY is used to stop
       the processor if the VIC needs additional bus cycles for character
       pointer and sprite data accesses. It is connected to the BA signal
       on the VIC.

AEC    This pin tri-states the address lines. This is used for making the
       processor address bus inactive during VIC accesses. The signal is
       connected to the AEC output on the VIC.

P0-P5  This is the built-in 6 bit I/O port. Each line can be individually
       programmed as input or output. A data direction register and a data
       register are internally mapped to addresses 0 and 1, respectively.
       You may therefore expect that the processor cannot access the RAM
       addresses 0 and 1 (as they are overlayed by the I/O port), but more
       on this later...
