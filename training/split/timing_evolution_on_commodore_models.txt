# Commodore IEC Serial Bus Protocol Reference - pagetable.com - Timing evolution of the IEC serial transfer across Commodore models: original 4 µs design (unshipped due to 6522 VIA bug), VIC-20 ~20 µs holds (~2 KB/s), C64 60 µs holds (<1 KB/s) due to VIC-II DMA stealing CPU cycles and affecting timing.

Timing Evolution:
  The timing requirements changed across Commodore computer models due to
  hardware constraints:

  Original design:  4 microsecond hold times (never shipped; 6522 VIA bug)
  VIC-20:          20 microsecond hold times (~2 KB/sec theoretical throughput)
  C64:             60 microsecond hold times (<1 KB/sec throughput)

  The C64 slowdown was caused by VIC-II video chip DMA stealing CPU cycles,
  making the CPU unavailable for precise timing. This reflects "a design goal
  that its speed would be comparable to IEEE-488" that practical constraints
  prevented.
