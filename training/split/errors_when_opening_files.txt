# COMMODORE 64 - Lists BASIC/DOS error conditions related to OPEN: ?FILE NOT OPEN if accessing before OPEN; ?FILE NOT FOUND if opening for reading a non-existent file; FILE EXISTS (DOS) if opening for writing and the filename already exists (disk only); warns that tape has no such check (risk overwriting); FILE OPEN occurs if attempting to OPEN a file already open. Notes to consult Printer Manual for printer-specific details.

    If you try to access a file before it is OPENed the BASIC error message
  ?FILE NOT OPEN will occur. If you try to OPEN a file for reading which
  does not exist the BASIC error message ?FILE NOT FOUND will occur. If
  a file is OPENed to disk for writing and the file-name already exists,
  the DOS error message FILE EXISTS occurs. There is no check of this type
  available for tape files, so be sure that the tape is properly positioned
  or you might accidentally write over some data that had previously been
  SAVED. If a file is OPENed that is already OPEN, the BASIC error message
  FILE OPEN occurs. (See Printer Manual for further details.)
