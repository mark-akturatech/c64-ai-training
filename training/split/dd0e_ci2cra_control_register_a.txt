$DD0E        CI2CRA       Control Register A

                     0    Start Timer A (1=start, 0=stop)
                     1    Select Timer A output on Port B (1=Timer A output appears on
                            Bit 6 of Port B)
                     2    Port B output mode (1=toggle Bit 6, 0=pulse Bit 6 for one
                            cycle)
                     3    Timer A run mode (1=one-shot, 0=continuous)
                     4    Force latched value to be loaded to Timer A counter (1=force
                            load strobe)
                     5    Timer A input mode (1=count microprocessor cycles, 0=count
                            signals on CNT line at pin 4 of User Port)
                     6    Serial Port (56588, $DD0C) mode (1=output, 0=input)
                     7    Time of Day Clock frequency (1=50 Hz required on TOD pin,
                            0=60 Hz)
