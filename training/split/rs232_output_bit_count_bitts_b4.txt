# ********* - Describes BITTS ($B4), which counts RS-232 output bits and is used for parity and stop-bit handling. Tape load routines also use this location to flag readiness to receive data bytes.

180           $B4            BITTS
RS-232 Output Bit Count/Cassette Temporary Storage

RS-232 routines use this to count the number of bits transmitted, and
for parity and stop bit manipulation.  Tape load routines use this
location to flag when they are ready to receive data bytes.
