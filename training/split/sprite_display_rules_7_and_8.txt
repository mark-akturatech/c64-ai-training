# The MOS 6567/6569 video controller (VIC-II) and its application in the Commodore 64 - Continues display rules covering cycles 15 and 16: in phase 1 of cycle 15, if the expansion flip-flop is set then MCBASE is incremented by 2; in phase 1 of cycle 16, if the expansion flip-flop is set then MCBASE is incremented by 1. After cycle 16's check the VIC tests if MCBASE equals 63 and, if so, turns off DMA and the sprite display.

7. In the first phase of cycle 15, it is checked if the expansion flip flop
   is set. If so, MCBASE is incremented by 2.

8. In the first phase of cycle 16, it is checked if the expansion flip flop
   is set. If so, MCBASE is incremented by 1. After that, the VIC checks if
   MCBASE is equal to 63 and turns of the DMA and the display of the sprite
   if it is.
