# Kick Assembler - Chapter 5 header and introduction to Branching and Looping control directives in Kick Assembler; Section 5.1 introduction to Boolean values and examples of boolean variable assignments (.var myBoolean1 = true, .var myBoolean2 = false) and boolean expressions using comparisons (e.g. .var fourHigherThanFive = 4>5, .var aEqualsB = a==b, .var xNot10 = x!=10).

Branching and Looping
Kick Assembler has control directives that let you put conditions on when a directive is executed and how
many time it is executed. These are explained in this chapter.

5.1. Boolean Values
The conditions for control directives are given by Boolean values, which are values that can be true or false.
They are generated and used as in programming languages like Java and C#. The following are examples of
boolean variables:
.var myBoolean1 = true
// Set the variable to true
.var myBoolean2 = false
// Set the variable to false
.var fourHigherThanFive = 4>5 // Sets fourHigherThanFive = false
.var aEqualsB = a==b
// Sets true if a is the same as b
.var xNot10 = x!=10
// Sets true if x doesn’t equal 10
