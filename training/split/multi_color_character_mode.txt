# COMMODORE 64 - Multi-color character mode (MCM = 1, BMM = ECM = 0): how enabling MCM changes interpretation of character dot data to use 2-bit color pairs, allowing up to four colors per character with halved horizontal resolution. Describes conditional behavior when the MSB of the color nybble = 0 (character behaves as in standard mode, lower 8 colors only) and when MSB = 1 (MCM interpretation). Includes the CHARACTER BIT-PAIR to COLOR mapping: 00 = Background #0, 01 = Background #1 (register 34), 10 = Background #2 (register 35), 11 = color from 3 LSBs of color nybble. Notes that dots are doubled horizontally producing a 4*8 matrix and mentions MOB priority implication.


  MULTI-COLOR CHARACTER MODE (MCM = 1, BMM = ECM = 0 )

    Multi-color mode provides additional color flexibility allowing up to
  four colors within each character but with reduced resolution. The multi-
  color mode is selected by setting the MCM bit in register 22 ($16) to
  "1," which causes the dot data stored in the character base to be
  interpreted in a different manner. If the MSB of the color nybble is a
  "0," the character will be displayed as described in standard character
  mode, allowing the two modes to be inter-mixed (however, only the lower
  order 8 colors are available). When the MSB of the color nybble is a "1"
  (if MCM:MSB(CM) = 1) the character bits are interpreted in the multi-
  color mode:

                | CHARACTER  |
     FUNCTION   |  BIT PAIR  |               COLOR DISPLAYED
  --------------+------------+---------------------------------------------
    Background  |     00     |  Background #0 Color
                |            |  (register 33 ($21))
    Background  |     01     |  Background #1 Color
                |            |  (register 34 ($22)
    Foreground  |     10     |  Background #2 Color
                |            |  (register 35 ($23)
    Foreground  |     11     |  Color specified by 3 LSB
                |            |  of color nybble

  Since two bits are required to specify one dot color, the character is
  now displayed as a 4*8 matrix with each dot twice the horizontal size as
  in standard mode. Note, however, that each character region can now
  contain 4 different colors, two as foreground and two as background (see
  MOB priority).
