# Contents - Sprite basics: sprites are small movable bitmaps, can be shown on any display mode and look identical across modes. Standard sprite size: 24x21 pixels; pixels set to 1 use one of 16 colors, 0 = transparent. Multicolor sprites have 12x21 resolution using 3 colors + transparent. VIC can double X or Y (or both) to expand sprites but does not increase detail.



pear to move in front of a sprite with a lower priori- 
ty. This can be used to give the illusion of three 
dimensional movement. The priority of a sprite to 
the background graphics is individually selected for 
each sprite. If the background is given priority, the 
sprite will appear to move behind the background 
graphics. For instance, if a tree was being displayed 
in the bit mapped graphics mode, and a sprite in 
the shape of a dog was to move past the tree, the 
dog would appear to be moving behind the tree. 

Each sprite is a block 24 pixels horizontally by 
21 pixels vertically. The pixels that are set to one 
use 1 of the 16 available colors. The pixels that are 
set to zero allow the background color to show 
through (are transparent). Like the other graphics 
modes, a sprite can be selected to be in the 
multicolor mode, giving it a resolution of 12 by 21 
in three colors plus transparent. Wherever a sprite 
is transparent, whatever is behind the sprite will 
show through. 

For those times when a larger sprite is 
necessary, the VIC chip has the option of doubling 
the horizontal size, the vertical size, or both. You 
will not increase the detail available in your sprite 
by using one of the multiply options, only the size. 
When a sprite is expanded, each of the pixels is 
twice the size of the pixels in a normal sprite.
