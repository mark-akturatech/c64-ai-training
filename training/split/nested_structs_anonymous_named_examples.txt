# ca65 Users Guide - Examples of nested structs: named nested structures create a new scope with offsets starting at 0 (e.g., Object::target is a named struct Point whose members start at 0), while anonymous nested structures add their members to the enclosing scope and continue offsets (examples showing Object::price, Object::tax and anonymous radius). Shows correct vs incorrect ways to reference nested members.



      .struct Object
              id .byte                ; Object::id = 0

                      ycoord  .word   ; Object::Point::ycoord = 2
