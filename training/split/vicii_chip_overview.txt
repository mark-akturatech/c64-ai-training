# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Overview of the VIC-II video chip: its responsibility for the C64 display, ability to address 16K banks independently of the 6510, location of VIC-II I/O registers ($D000-$D02E / 53248-53294), and a short intro to the graphics subsystems (text, character dot data, sprites, bitmap).


$D000-$D02E               VIC-II Chip Registers

                          The Video Interface Controller (VIC-II chip) is a specially designed
                          processor that is in charge of the 64's video display.  It is this
                          chip which makes possible the 64's wide range of graphics
                          capabilities.

                          The VIC-II chip's ability to address memory is independent of the 6510
                          microprocessor.  It can address only 16K at a time, and any of the
                          four blocks of 16K can be chosen for video memory.  The system default
                          is for it to use the first 16K.

                          All of the video display memory, character dot data, and sprite shapes
                          must be stored within the chosen 16K block.  Locations 53248-53294
                          ($D000-$D02E) are registers which allow the user to communicate with
                          the VIC-II chip.  Although for the most part they can be written to
                          and read like ordinary memory locations, their contents directly
                          control the video display.  Since many of these locations work in
                          close conjunction with others, a general overview of some of the
                          different graphics systems on the 64 is in order.
