# Contents - Entering graphics data: options include using a machine language monitor's Memory Display to write bytes directly into RAM (then save to disk and reference address in program) or entering data into an assembler using .BYTE directives and naming areas. Monitor approach writes memory directly; assembler approach stores graphics in assembled object code.


Once you have translated your drawing into a 
series of bytes, you have a couple of options as to 
what to do with the data. If you have a machine 
language monitor, you may choose to use the 
Memory Display option to display the range of 
memory where you would like your graphics data 
to go. At this point, your monitor should allow you 
to change the data on the screen. By using the data 
from your drawings to modify the data on the 
screen, you will create a section of memory that 
represents your graphics. After you have finished 
entering the data into the monitor, be sure to save 
the range of memory that you have just modified 
to the disk. The next step is to enter the address 
of your graphics into your program so that it can 
find the graphics later.
