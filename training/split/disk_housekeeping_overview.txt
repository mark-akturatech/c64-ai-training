2.5  Disk  Housekeeping 


As  your  collection  of  programs  grows,  you  will  have  to  do  some  housekeeping  to  keep 
things  in  shape.  Disk  housekeeping  chores  include  the  following: 

1.  Preparing  a  blank  diskette  for  first-time  use. 

2.  Erasing  the  contents  of  a  diskette  currently  in  use. 

3.  Initializing  a  diskette. 

4.  Renaming  a  file. 

5.  Scratching  or  erasing  a  file. 

6.  Copying  a  file. 

These  operations  are  carried  out  by  the  DOS  in  response  to  commands  sent  to  the  drive 
using  the  command  channel  as  indicated  above.  Once  a  disk  housekeeping  command  is 
issued,  the  disk  drive  will  carry  out  the  task  without  further  intervention  by  the  com- 
puter. This  means  that  you  could  edit  or  even  RUN  a  program  in  RAM  while  the  disk 
drive  busily  formats  or  validates  a  diskette.  This  is  not  really  spooling.  It  occurs  because 
the  1541  is  an  intelligent  peripheral.  The  only  thing  that  will  cause  your  computer  to 
wait  for  the  disk  drive  to  complete  its  task  is  your  attempting  to  perform  another  disk 
operation.  This  includes  closing  the  command  channel.
