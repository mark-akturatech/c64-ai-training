# Analyzing C64 tape loaders - Describes Turbo Loader encoding: many turbo loaders use two pulses (short and long), with chosen frequencies; each pulse length alone can represent a bit (1 or 0). Turbo loaders typically rely on pulse-length thresholds rather than the CBM medium/short pair scheme.

On the other side, a Turbo Loader usually uses just two pulses:

  * "short pulse"
  * "long pulse"

whose frequencies are chosen by its designer. The length of a pulse saved on tape decides whether the bit is a 1 or a 0. In fact, these loaders don't usually use a sequence of pulses to encode a bit: just a single pulse does the job.
