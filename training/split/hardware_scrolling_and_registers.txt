# Contents - Hardware scrolling: VIC can perform fine scrolling within an 8-pixel range in X and/or Y freeing CPU from pixel-level moves. Lower 3 bits of YSCRL ($D011) control vertical scroll; lower 3 bits of XSCRL ($D016) control horizontal scroll. Because these registers also hold other control bits, read-modify-write is required when changing fine scroll values (mask lower 3 bits and OR new value).

SCROLLING 

One of the most advanced features of the VIC 
chip is its ability to smoothly scroll the screen in 
either the X or Y direction. The VIC chip can scroll 
the screen using hardware, freeing the 
microprocessor from the task of finely scrolling the 
screen. When the screen needs to be scrolled, the 
VIC chip can be instructed to scroll the screen 
within a range of 8 pixels in the X direction, the Y 
direction, or both. 

The least significant three bits of the YSCRL 
($D01 1) register control the amount of vertical 
scrolling. Since this register is also used for a 
number of control functions, the register should be 
read before it is changed. The XSCRL ($D016) 
register works in the same way as the YSCRL 
register except that the XSCRL register controls the 
amount of horizontal scrolling. When changing 
either of these registers, the lower 3 bits should be 
masked to 0, and the number of pixels to be 
scrolled should be OR'd to the new value. The result 
of this procedure can then be stored back into the 
register.
