# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - INITAT: CHRGET routine copied into RAM at $0073 on power-up/reset. Implements a character-get loop that increments the TXTPTR low ($7A) and high ($7B) bytes, reads characters from the CHRGOT entry ($EA60), treats colon (':') as terminator and space as skip, and includes numeric character conversion logic using SEC/SBC sequences (subtracting ASCII '0' and an adjusted value). Ends with RTS. This copyable routine is the source for the CHRGET code relocated into zeropage RAM.
