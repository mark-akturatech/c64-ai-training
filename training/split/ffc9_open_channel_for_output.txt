# C64 KERNAL API (Lee Davison) - $FFC9 — Open channel for output. Marks an already-open logical file as the output channel; device must be output-capable. If omitted, screen (device 3) is default output. For serial devices this will send LISTEN and any secondary address automatically. Possible error codes: 3=file not open, 5=device not present, 7=file is not an output file.

$FFC9          open channel for output
               
               Any logical file that has already been opened by the OPEN routine, $FFC0, can be
               defined as an output channel by this routine the device on the channel must be an
               output device or an error will occur and the routine will abort.
               
               If you are sending data to anywhere other than the screen this routine must be
               called before using the CHROUT routine, $FFD2. if you are sending data to the
               screen and no other output channels are open then the calls to this routine and to
               the OPEN routine, $FFC0, are not needed.
               
               When used with a device on the serial bus this routine will automatically send the
               listen address specified by the OPEN routine, $FFC0, and any secondary address.
               
               Possible errors are:
               
               * 3 : file not open
               * 5 : device not present
               * 7 : file is not an output file
