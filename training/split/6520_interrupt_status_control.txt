# MACHINE - Interrupt Status Control: logic that interprets Control Register contents, detects active transitions on CA1/CA2/CB1/CB2 inputs, sets interrupt flags accordingly and performs actions needed for peripheral interrupt control.

Interrupt Status Control
------------------------

The four interrupt/peripheral control lines (CA1, CA2, CB1, CB2) are
controlled by the Interrupt Status Control (A,B).  This logic interprets the
contents of the corresponding Control Register, detects active transitions on
the interrupt inputs and performs those operations necessary to assure proper
operation of these four peripheral interface lines.
