# ********* - The 6510 CPU reserves last six bytes of memory for three hardware vectors: NMI vector at $FFFA (65530) points to main NMI routine ($FE43 / 65091); System Reset (RES) vector at $FFFC (65532) points to power-on routine ($FCE2 / 64738); IRQ/BRK vector at $FFFE (65534) points to main IRQ handler ($FF48 / 65352). These tell the CPU where to start execution for NMI, RES, and IRQ/BRK events.

Location Range: 65530-65535 ($FFFA-$FFFF)
6510 Hardware Vectors

The last six locations in memory are reserved by the 6510 processor
chip for three fixed vectors.  These vectors let the chip know at what
address to start executing machine language program code when an NMI
interrupt occurs, when the computer is turned on, or when an IRQ
interrupt or BRK occurs.

65530         $FFFA
Non-Maskable Interrupt Hardware Vector

This vector points to the main NMI routine at 65091 ($FE43).

65532         $FFFC
System Reset (RES) Hardware Vector

This vector points to the power-on routine at 64738 ($FCE2).

65534         $FFFE
Maskable Interrupt Request and Break Hardware Vectors

This vector points to the main IRQ handler routine at 65352 ($FF48).
