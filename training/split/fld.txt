# The MOS 6567/6569 video controller (VIC-II) and its application in the Commodore 64 - Flexible Line Distance (FLD): by manipulating YSCROLL, Bad Lines can be delayed/suppressed to control which raster lines start text lines. This allows arbitrary vertical spacing between text lines and vertical shifts of the display without moving memory bytes. Example: allowing only three Bad Lines will display three text lines at chosen positions with idle state between them.

3.14.2. FLD
-----------

When building the graphics out of text lines, the VIC orientates itself
exclusively by the occurrence of Bad Lines: A Bad Line gives the "start
signal" for the display of one text line. By appropriately changing YSCROLL
(in register $d011) you can suppress and arbitrarily delay the Bad Line
Condition (see 3.5.). So you can exactly control in which raster lines Bad
Lines should occur and thus from which raster lines the VIC should start to
display one text line each. The distance between two text lines can be
arbitrarily increased if only you hold back the next Bad Line long enough.
This effect is called "Flexible Line Distance" (FLD).

E.g. if you only allow three Bad Lines on the screen at raster lines $50,
$78 and $a0, the VIC will also only display three text lines at these
positions. The sequencer is in idle state in the lines between.

If you only delay the occurrence of the first Bad Line, you can scroll down
the complete graphics display by large distances without moving a single
byte in display memory.
