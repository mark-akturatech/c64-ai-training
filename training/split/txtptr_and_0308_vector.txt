# MACHINE - Explains TXTPTR (text pointer) — address of instruction at CHRGOT pointing to the BASIC command being executed. On VIC-20/C64 a vector at $0308/$0309 provides control immediately before each BASIC command, allowing wedges to examine BASIC text (via indirect indexed addressing) and leave TXTPTR positioned correctly on return.

                                                                        :125:

The address of the instruction at CHRGOT is often referred to as TXTPTR, the
text pointer.  This address always points to the BASIC command being executed
at the moment.  If we want to participate in reading BASIC, we must learn to
use TXTPTR to get information--usually by means of indirect, indexed
addressing--and to leave this address pointing at a suitable place when we
return control back to the normal BASIC handling programs.


Project:  Adding a Command
--------------------------

Let's add a simple command to the VIC and Commodore 64 by using the $0308
vector.  The ampersand (&) character isn't used in most BASIC programs, so
we'll make it mean this:  whenever you see the code "&", print ten asterisk
(*) characters to the computer screen, followed by a carriage return.
