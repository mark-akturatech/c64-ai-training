# Contents - Overview of sprite control registers: most sprite control registers map one bit to each sprite (bit 0 -> sprite 0, bit 1 -> sprite 1, etc.), while other controls that require values (like vertical position) have one register per sprite.

Sprite Controls 

For most of the sprite control registers, each bit 
in the register corresponds to one of the sprites. For 
example, bit represents sprite O, bit 1 represents 
sprite 1 , and so on. The rest of the sprite controls 
require a value (such as a vertical location), so there 
is one register for each sprite.
