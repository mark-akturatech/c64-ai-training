# Datassette Encoding - Layout of a tape data block: 192-byte payload recorded twice (for redundancy); synchronization leader of short pulses (10 seconds for first block, 2 seconds for subsequent blocks) used to compute speed correction; countdown byte sequences ($89-$81 for first copy, $09-$01 for second); one-byte checksum (XOR of $00 and all payload bytes); inter-record gaps made of a long pulse followed by 60 short pulses.

Data Block Structure
--------------------

Each block contains:

  - 192-byte payload (recorded twice for error detection)
  - Synchronization leader: 10 seconds for first block,
    2 seconds for subsequent blocks
  - Countdown byte sequence: $89-$81 (first copy), $09-$01 (second copy)
  - One-byte checksum: XOR of $00 and all payload bytes
  - Inter-record gaps: Long pulse + 60 short pulses

The leader consists of short pulses. During this time, the Kernal calculates
a speed correction factor, since tape speed might vary for different motors.
