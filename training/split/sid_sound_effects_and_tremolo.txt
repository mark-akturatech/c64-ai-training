# Contents - Discussion of the variety of sound effects possible with the SID chip. Notes that sophisticated real-time control (for example, changing a channel's volume) enables effects like tremolo. Describes demo program segments that generate sounds and a tune-playing routine which reads note and time tables; a note value of $00 terminates the tune. Explains that changing the note and time tables will produce different tunes.

Me sounds and effects in the program are by no 



means all of the sound effects that can be created 
by the SID chip. Depending on how sophisticated 
you care to become, you will be able to get many 
effects that are not directly obvious. For instance, 
if you write a program that changes the volume of 
one of the channels in real time, you will have full 
control over generating different types of tremelo 
effects. 

There are program segments in the demo that 
can be used directly or expanded to help generate 
almost any type of sound or tune. The routine that 
generates the short tune that is played to show the 
effects of different waveforms simply reads a list of 
notes and note times. If the value of a note is $00, 
then the routine will quit. By changing the note 
values in the note table and the time values in the 
time table, this routine will play any type of tune.
