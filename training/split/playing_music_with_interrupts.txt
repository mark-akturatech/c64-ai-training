# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Playing music inside IRQ handler: initialize music player before IRQ setup, then JSR to music-play routine from the interrupt handler to play music synchronized with frames.

Playing music again
It should be trivial for you to alter the interrupt example program to play music. All you have to do is to init the music before the interrupt initialization, and then do a JSR to the play routine in the interrupt handler routine. If you can't remember how to do this, check the example on playing music (without interrupts) above.
