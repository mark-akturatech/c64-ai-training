# 6502 Microprocessor - Absolute and Zero-page addressing: absolute provides full 16-bit address (low byte stored first), zero-page uses one byte address with implicit high byte $00. Examples and opcode differences shown.

  2 & 3) Absolute and Zero-page Absolute
  In these modes the operands address is given.
  eg.  LDA $31F6 - (assembler)
       $AD $31F6 - (machine code)
  If the address is on zero page - i.e. any address where the high byte is
  00 - only 1 byte is needed for the address. The processor automatically
  fills the 00 high byte.
  eg.  LDA $F4
       $A5 $F4
  Note the different instruction codes for the different modes.
  Note also that for 2 byte addresses, the low byte is store first, eg.
  LDA $31F6 is stored as three bytes in memory, $AD $F6 $31.
  Zero-page absolute is usually just called zero-page.
