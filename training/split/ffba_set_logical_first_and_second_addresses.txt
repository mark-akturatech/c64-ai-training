# C64 KERNAL API (Lee Davison) - $FFBA — Set logical file number, device address and secondary (command) address for KERNAL I/O routines. Logical file number indexes the file table used by OPEN. Device addresses 0..30 map to built-in devices (0=keyboard,1=cassette #1,2=RS-232,3=CRT display,4=printer,8=disk drive). Devices >=4 are on the serial bus. If no secondary address is needed set Y=$FF.

$FFBA          set logical, first and second addresses
               
               This routine will set the logical file number, device address, and secondary
               address, command number, for other KERNAL routines.
               
               the logical file number is used by the system as a key to the file table created
               by the OPEN file routine. Device addresses can range from 0 to 30. The following
               codes are used by the computer to stand for the following CBM devices:
               
               | ADDRESS | DEVICE                    |
               |---------|---------------------------|
               |  0      | Keyboard                  |
               |  1      | Cassette #1               |
               |  2      | RS-232C device            |
               |  3      | CRT display               |
               |  4      | Serial bus printer        |
               |  8      | CBM Serial bus disk drive |
               
               Device numbers of four or greater automatically refer to devices on the serial
               bus.
               
               A command to the device is sent as a secondary address on the serial bus after
               the device number is sent during the serial attention handshaking sequence. If
               no secondary address is to be sent Y should be set to $FF.
