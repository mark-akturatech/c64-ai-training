# byRiclianll - Chapter 3 overview: When a diskette is new it must be formatted (NEW). Formatting writes 35 concentric tracks and creates sectors (varying by track), a directory, and the Block Availability Map (BAM) on track 18. Introduces that each sector is composed of a header block and a data block.

CHAPTER  3 


DISKETTE  FORMATTING 


When  you  take  a  new  floppy  diskette  out  of  the  package,  it  is  blank.  Before  the  drive 
can  store  data  onto  it,  it  must  be  formatted.  This  is  done  by  inserting  the  diskette  into 
the  drive  and  sending  a  NEW  command  to  the  DOS  (see  Section  2.5).  During  "format- 
ting" or  "newing,"  35  concentric  tracks  are  written  to  the  diskette.  Each  track  is  made 
up  of  varying  numbers  of  sectors/blocks  where  programs  and  data  will  eventually  be 
stored.  In  addition  to  laying  down  empty  blocks/sectors,  the  DOS  creates  a  directory 
and  a  block  availability  map  (BAM)  and  records  them  on  track  18. 

This  chapter  describes  the  formatting  process  and  the  tracks  and  sectors  of  a  diskette. 
Chapter  4  describes  the  directory  and  the  block  availability  map  (BAM).
