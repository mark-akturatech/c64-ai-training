# COMMODORE 64 - Explains LINE 45 where P=192 is set. Describes P as the SPRITE POINTER value used to make sprite 0 point to the memory block beginning at 12288 (pointer 192). Explains that changing P to the other pointer values swaps which stored shape sprite 0 displays, enabling the animation by rotating pointers among the three shape blocks.

  LINE 45:

    P=192               Sets the variable P equal to 192. This number 192
                        is the pointer you must use, in this case to
                        "point" sprite 0 to the memory locations that begin
                        at location 12288. Changing this pointer to the
                        locations of the other two sprite shapes is the
                        secret of using one sprite to create an animation
                        that is actually three different shapes.
