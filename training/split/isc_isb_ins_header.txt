# NMOS 6510 - Header entry for ISC (also called ISB or INS). Specifies the instruction type (combination of two operations with the same addressing mode; sub-instructions INC and SBC), and provides the high-level semantic effect on memory ({addr} = {addr} + 1). This is the initial header block for the ISC family; detailed opcodes and addressing-mode specifics follow elsewhere in the document.

ISC (ISB, INS)
