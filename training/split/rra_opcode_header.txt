# NMOS 6510 - Header for the RRA (aka RRD) undocumented opcode: describes it as a combination of two operations with the same addressing mode (sub-instructions: ROR on memory, then ADC with memory). Lists opcode bytes and mnemonics for zero-page variants ($67, $77) and shows the function summary ({addr} = ror {addr}; A = A adc {addr}) and placeholders for size and cycle/flag header. This entry is the immediate follow-up section after the SRE examples.
