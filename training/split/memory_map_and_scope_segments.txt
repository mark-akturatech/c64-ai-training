# Kick Assembler - Example memory map produced by -showmem option for the previous example: Code-segment ranges and Data-segment ranges. Notes that scoping and segments don't affect each other (labels can be local inside different segments).

.segment Buffer
table1: .fill $100, 0
table2: .fill $100, 0

Notice that overlapping code only gives an error if it's inside the same segment. So you can place code in both
'InitCode' and 'Buffer' without getting errors. The Code and InitCode segments are saved in the file while the
Buffer is thrown away.
By using the 'align' parameter together with 'startAfter' you align the default memory block.
.segmentdef Code
[start=$8000]
.segmentdef Virtual100 [startAfter= "Code", align=$100, virtual]
.segment Code "Some code"
ldx #$ff
lda table,x
.segment Virtual100 "Table"
table: .fill $100,0
