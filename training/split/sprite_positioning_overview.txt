# Contents - Sprite positioning overview: each sprite has independent X and Y position registers plus a most significant X bit in XMSB ($D010) because screen width is 320 (requires 9 bits). Position values refer to upper-left corner of sprite.


Positioning sprites. Each sprite can be posi- 
tioned independently anywhere on the visible 
screen and off the visible screen in any direction. 
Since the screen is 320 pixels wide, it takes more 
than one byte to specify a horizontal position. Each 
sprite has its own X position register and Y posi- 
tion register, and a bit in an extra most significant 
bit register. These registers are shown in Table 7-5.

The location specified by the registers is the posi- 
tion where the upper left corner of the sprite will 
appear.
