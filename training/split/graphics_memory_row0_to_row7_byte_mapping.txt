# Contents - The first part of Table 7-3 showing how graphics memory bytes map to screen positions for ROW0 and the next seven internal sub-rows (rows labeled 1 through 7 in the sequence). Lists the low-range byte labels and their arrangement (examples: $8, $9, $A, ... $13F) as they appear in the repeated per-row sequence.
