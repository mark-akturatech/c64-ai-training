# NMOS 6510 - Practical examples using the dummy-read behaviour of absolute indexed accesses: acknowledging both CIA interrupts with a single LDA $DC1D,X, 5-cycle-wide raster splits using STA/LDX/LDY sequences, and feeding VIC sprite pattern pipe using STA VIC_REG,X timed to DMA cycles. Includes testcode references.
