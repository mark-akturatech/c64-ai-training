# byRiclianll - Binary and semi-readable region starting at offset 90: and continuing through AO: of TRACK 17 SECTOR 11. Shows repeated byte values (many AO / 00 / OO-like placeholders), numeric entries and short ASCII fragments. Contains short textual fragments (examples: SNG and parts of COPY / MATH) embedded among pointer/slot bytes, plus small numeric and control values that look like file-pointer slots or allocation placeholders.
