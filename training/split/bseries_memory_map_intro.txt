# MACHINE - Introduction to B-Series memory map changes for machines released after April 1983 (revised machine language monitor). Notes on CHRGOT relocation, 'split' BASIC vectors, three-byte vectors including bank number, accessible jump table, and program placement strategies (use spare 1K at $0400-$07FF or plug-in RAM/ROM in bank 15 or other banks).

Memory Map
----------

The following information applies to B systems released after April 1983,
which contain a revised machine language monitor.  (If POKE 6,0:SYS 6 doesn't
bring in a monitor display complete with a "period" prompt, you have an
incompatible version.)

Notable features as compared to previous Commodore products include:

 - CHRGOT is no longer in RAM.  Wedge-type coding must be inserted at links
   $029E and $02A0, which is likely to make the job easier.

 - BASIC vectors have "split."  Now, for example, there are discrete "start
   of variables" and "end of variables," distinct from end-of-BASIC and
   start-of-arrays.  Three-byte vectors (including bank number) are not
   uncommon.

 - The "jump table" at the top of memory is still accessible and reasonably
   consistent with previous Commodore products.

 - Simple machine language programs will fit into the spare 1K of RAM at
   $0400 to $07FF without trouble.  Large programs must be implemented either
   by plug-in memory (RAM or ROM) in bank 15 or by being placed into another
   bank (preferably bank 3).  Supplementary code will be needed to make all
   the coding components fit.
