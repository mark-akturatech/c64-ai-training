# The MOS 6567/6569 video controller (VIC-II) and its application in the Commodore 64 - Introduction to the memory areas relevant to VIC: 64KB main RAM, 1K*4 Color RAM, 4KB Char ROM. Explanation that CPU and VIC have different views of memory and address decoding.

2.4. Memory
-----------

Three memory areas in the C64 are involved with the graphics:

 � The 64KB main memory
 � The 1K*4 bit Color RAM
 � The 4KB character generator ROM (Char ROM)

In the following two sections it is explained how these memory areas share
the address space as seen by the CPU and the VIC. After that, the basics of
memory access and DRAM handling are mentioned.
