    Computers have three basic abilities: they can calculate, make deci-
  sions, and communicate. Calculation is probably the easiest to program.
  Most of the rules of mathematics are familiar to us. Decision making is
  not too difficult, since the rules of logic are relatively few, even if
  you don't know them too well yet.
    Communication is the most complex, because it involves the least
  exacting set of rules. This is not an oversight in the design of
  computers. The rules allow enough flexibility to communicate virtually
  anything, and in many possible ways. The only real rule is this: whatever
  sends information must present the information so that it can be
  understood by the receiver.


  OUTPUT TO THE TV

    The simplest form of output in BASIC is the PRINT statement. PRINT uses
  the TV screen as the output device, and your eyes are the input device
  because they use the information on the screen.
    When PRINTing on the screen, your main objective is to format the
  information on the screen so it's easy to read. You should try to think
  like a graphic artist, using colors, placement of letters, capital and
  lower case letters, as well as graphics to best communicate the
  information. Remember, no matter how smart your program, you want to be
  able to understand what the results mean to you.
    The PRINT statement uses certain character codes as "commands" to the
  cursor. The <CRSR> key doesn't actually display anything, it just makes
  the cursor change position. Other commands change colors, clear the
  screen, and insert or delete spaces. The <RETURN> key has a character
  code number (CHR$) of 13. A complete table of these codes is contained in
  Appendix C.
    There are two functions in the BASIC language that work with the PRINT
  statement. TAB positions the,cursor on the given position from the left
  edge of the screen, SPC moves the cursor right a given number of spaces
  from the current position.
    Punctuation marks in the PRINT statement serve to separate and format
  information. The semicolon (;) separates 2 items without any spaces in
  between. If it is the last thing on a line, the cursor remains after the
  last thing PRINTed instead of going down to the next line. It suppresses
