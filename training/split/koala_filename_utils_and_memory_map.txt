# Contents - Utilities (COM-KO and KO-COM BASIC programs) to convert file names to/from Koala format; instructions to change names for loading. Koala memory map for a saved picture: $6000-$7F3F graphics image, $7F40-$8327 color memory image, $8328-$870F color RAM image, $8710 background color. Note about cartridge-based monitors possibly preventing reading of the file.

A pair of utility programs that will convert file 
names to and from the Koala Pad format are in Ap- 
pendix C. These are: 

Listing C-12 KO-COM Changes the name from 

Koala format to 
Commodore format. 

Listing C-13 COM-KO Changes the name from 

Commodore format to 
Koala format. 

These are BASIC programs that will prompt 
you for the current filename and the name that you 
would like the file to be called. When using COM- 
KO, the program will insert the special character 
at the beginning of the name for you. 

After you have changed the name of the file in- 
to something that can be loaded, you will be able 
to use your machine language monitor to examine 
and reconfigure the data. The data is stored on disk 
in the following format: 

Koala Memory Map 

$6000 - $7F3F Graphics image 
$7F40 - $8327 Color memory image 
$8328 - $870F Color RAM image 
$8710 Background color 

Note: If you are using a cartridge based machine 
language monitor, you may not be able to read the 
file as the cartridge replaces the RAM where the 
data will be loaded. 

After you have loaded the file, you can relocate 
the graphics data and the color data to anywhere
