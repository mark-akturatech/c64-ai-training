# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Introduction to interrupts in demo programming: importance for smooth timing, avoiding jitter, and enabling loaders (IRQ loaders). Focuses on raster interrupts and NMIs as the most relevant types for demos.

Interrupts
Okay, so far we've learnt a lot of useful things for putting graphics on the screen (and playing music, but that's almost too easy to mention). To sum it all up, we have all the tools we need to write programs that display graphics and play music. Multimedia programs, or something like that. We don't know everything we need to write demos, though. Demos, as I said in the introduction, are quite different from programs that display graphics and play music.

All the example programs above have suffered from one great problem: they have been badly timed, and all movement (as well as the playback of the music) has been jerky and inexact. We need to do something about that. You can't have a scroll text that doesn't move smoothly, or jittering raster bars, because that's the definition of lameness.

So, how do we do something about it? Well, we need to know a bit about interrupts. Of course, as a demo coder, you really need to know everything about interrupts, but we're not going to be that complete here. We're going to be complete enough so that you can easily learn the rest by reading your reference material and poking around in your computer yourself, though. Wizardry isn't about knowing most of what there is to know, it's about being able to setup interrupt handlers after 20 beers (trust me, that's not easy :-).
