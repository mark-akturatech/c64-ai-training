# MACHINE - 6520 Data Direction Registers (DDRA, DDRB). Each bit programs the corresponding Peripheral I/O port line as input (0) or output (1). Typically programmed during system initialization (Reset) but can be changed during operation to support devices like keyboards.

Data Direction Registers (DDRA, DDRB)
-------------------------------------

The Data Direction Registers allow the processor to program each line in the
8-bit Peripheral I/O port to act as either an input or an output.  Each bit
in DDRA controls the corresponding line in the Peripheral A port and each bit
in DDRB controls the corresponding line in the Peripheral B port.  Placing a
"0" in the Data Direction Register causes the corresponding Peripheral I/O
line to act as an input.  A "1" causes it to act as an output.

The Data Direction Registers are normally programmed only during the system
initialization routine which is performed in response to a Reset signal.
However, the contents of these registers can be altered during system
operation.  This allows very convenient control of some peripheral devices
such as keyboards.
