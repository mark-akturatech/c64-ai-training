# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $D01D (53277) XXPAND — Sprite Horizontal Expansion Register: bits 0-7 control horizontal expansion for sprites 0-7 (1=double-width, 0=normal). Can be combined with vertical expansion ($D017) to scale sprites.

$D01D        XXPAND       Sprite Horizontal Expansion Register

                     0    Expand Sprite 0 horizontally (1=double-width sprite, 0=normal width)
                     1    Expand Sprite 1 horizontally (1=double-width sprite, 0=normal width)
                     2    Expand Sprite 2 horizontally (1=double-width sprite, 0=normal width)
                     3    Expand Sprite 3 horizontally (1=double-width sprite, 0=normal width)
                     4    Expand Sprite 4 horizontally (1=double-width sprite, 0=normal width)
                     5    Expand Sprite 5 horizontally (1=double-width sprite, 0=normal width)
                     6    Expand Sprite 6 horizontally (1=double-width sprite, 0=normal width)
                     7    Expand Sprite 7 horizontally (1=double-width sprite, 0=normal width)

                          This register can be used to double the width of any sprite.  Setting
                          any bit of this register to 1 will cause each dot of the corresponding
                          sprite shape to be displayed twice as wide as normal, so that without
                          changing its horizontal resolution, the sprite takes up twice as much
                          space.  The horizontal expansion feature can be used alone, or in
                          combination with the vertical expansion register at 53271 ($D017).
