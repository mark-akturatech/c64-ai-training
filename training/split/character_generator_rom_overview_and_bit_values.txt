# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Character Generator ROM ($D000-$DFFF alternate 53248-57343) overview: holds 4096 bytes representing two complete character sets (256 chars each, 8 bytes per character). Each byte defines one row of an 8x8 dot matrix; bit values for bits 0-7 are 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128 respectively. Explains how byte values map to displayed pixels and how character shapes are stored sequentially.

                          Character Generator ROM

                          The character generator ROM supplies the data which is to form the
                          shapes of the text and graphics characters that are displayed on the
                          screen.  Each character requires eight bytes of shape data, and these
                          eight-byte sequences are arranged in order in which the characters
                          appear in the screen code chart (see Appendix G).  For example, the
                          first eight bytes of data in the ROM hold the shape information for
                          the commercial at sign (@), the next eight hold the shape of the
                          letter A, etc.  In all, there are 4096 bytes, representing shape data
                          for two complete character sets of 256 characters each--1K each for
                          uppercase/graphics, reverse uppercase/reverse graphics, lowercase/
                          uppercase, and reverse lowercase/reverse uppercase.

                          The shape of each character is formed by an 8 by 8 matrix of screen
                          dots.  Whether any of the 64 dots is lit up or not is determined by
                          the bit patterns of the character data.  Each byte of the Character
                          ROM holds a number from 0 to 255.  This number can be represented by
                          eight binary digits of 0 or 1.  The leftmost bit of these eight is
                          known as Bit 7, while the rightmost bit is called Bit 0.  Each of
                          these binary digits has a bit value that is two times greater than the
                          last.  The values of a bit set to 1 in each of the bit places are:

                          |       |   |   |   |   |    |    |    |     |
                          |-------|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|-----|
                          | Bit   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |   7 |
                          | Value | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 32 | 64 | 128 |

                          A byte whose value is 255 has every bit set to 1
                          (128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1=255), while a byte whose value is 0 is made up
                          of all zero bits.  Numbers in between are made up of combinations of
                          bits set to 1 and bits set to 0.  If you think of every bit that holds
                          0 as a dot on the screen which is the color of the screen background,
                          and every bit that holds a 1 as a dot whose color is that of the
                          appropriate nybble in Color RAM, you can begin to get an idea of how
                          the byte values relate to the shape of the character.  For example, if
                          you PEEK at the first eight bytes of the character ROM (the technique
