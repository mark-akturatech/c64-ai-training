# COMMODORE 64 - Overview of five main ways to use machine language from BASIC: 1) BASIC SYS statement, 2) BASIC USR function, 3) changing RAM I/O vectors, 4) changing RAM interrupt vectors (IRQ), 5) changing CHRGET routine (wedge). Explains purpose and when each technique is used.

  USING MACHINE LANGUAGE FROM BASIC

    There are several methods of using BASIC and machine language on the
  Commodore 64, including special statements as part of CBM BASIC as well
  as key locations in the machine. There are five main ways to use machine
  language routines from BASIC on the Commodore 64. They are:


                1) The BASIC SYS statement
                2) The BASIC USR function
                3) Changing one of the RAM I/O vectors
                4) Changing one of the RAM interrupt vectors
                5) Changing the CHRGET routine
