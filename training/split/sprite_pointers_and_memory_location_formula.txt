# COMMODORE 64 - Explains SPRITE POINTER bytes: one pointer per sprite (8 total) stored as last 8 bytes of the 1K screen memory chunk (usually at 2040..2047). Each pointer (0..255) refers to a 64-byte block (each sprite uses 63 bytes + placeholder) so LOCATION = (BANK * 16384) + (SPRITE_POINTER_VALUE * 64). Notes that ROM image areas in BANK 0 & 2 cannot host sprite definitions; use BANK 1 or 3 if you need >128 definitions.


    Even though each sprite takes only 63 bytes to define, one more byte
  is needed as a place holder at the end of each sprite. Each sprite, then,
  takes up 64 bytes. This makes it easy to calculate where in memory your
  sprite definition is, since 64 bytes is an even number and in binary it's
  an even power.
    Each of the 8 sprites has a byte associated with it called the SPRITE
  POINTER. The sprite pointers control where each sprite definition is lo-
  cated in memory. These 8 bytes are always located as the lost 8 bytes
  of the 1K chunk of screen memory. Normally, on the Commodore 64, this
  means they begin at location 2040 ($07F8 in HEX). However, if you move
  the screen, the location of your sprite pointers will also move.
    Each sprite pointer can hold a number from 0 to 255. This number points
  to the definition for that sprite. Since each sprite definition takes
  64 bytes, that means that the pointer can "see" anywhere in the 16K
  block of memory that the VIC-II chip can access (since 256*64=16K).

    If sprite pointer #0, at location 2040, contains the number 14, for
  example, this means that sprite 0 will be displayed using the 64 bytes
  beginning at location 14*64 = 896 which is in the cassette buffer. The
  following formula makes this clear:

    LOCATION = (BANK * 16384) + (SPRITE POINTER VALUE * 64)

  Where BANK is the 16K segment of memory that the VIC-II chip is looking
  at and is from 0 to 3.
    The above formula gives the start of the 64 bytes of the sprite
  definition block.
    When the VIC-II chip is looking at BANK 0 or BANK 2, there is a ROM
  IMAGE of the character set present in certain locations, as mentioned
  before. Sprite definitions can NOT be placed there. If for some reason
  you need more than 128 different sprite definitions, you should use one
  of the banks without the ROM IMAGE, 1 or 3.
