Chapter 10 
Some Arcade Games 



Before attempting to design your own video game, 
it would probably be helpful to understand how 
some other games are designed. In this chapter, you 
will be shown some of the ways in which some 
popular arcade video games could be programmed 
into the Commodore 64. In fact, the description of 
how to program these games may be quite accurate 
in terms of how the original was done. Bear in mind, 
however, that arcade machines tend to have some 
specialized hardware for graphics creation.
