# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Prepares and sends the parity bit after all data bits of a byte have been transmitted. Toggles the parity flip stored in $9B (LDA $9B; EOR #$01) and places the result into the tape write byte register ($BD) to be transmitted on the next bit cycles, then exits (JMP $FEBC).

                                set parity as next bit and exit interrupt
.,FC4E A5 9B    LDA $9B         get parity bit
.,FC50 49 01    EOR #$01        toggle it
.,FC52 85 BD    STA $BD         save as tape write byte
.,FC54 4C BC FE JMP $FEBC       restore registers and exit interrupt
