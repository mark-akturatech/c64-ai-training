# NMOS 6510 - Discussion of CPU control inputs (/RDY and /AEC) and VIC/REU interactions: explains how RDY pauses CPU on read cycles, AEC disconnects CPU from buses, how VIC uses BA and AEC to halt CPU during badlines and sprite fetches, and how the REU monitors BA and uses /DMA to pull CPU off the bus, including consequences for R-M-W cycles.
