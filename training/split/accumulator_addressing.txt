# 6502 ADDRESSING MODES - Accumulator addressing: operations apply directly to the accumulator and are indicated by the operand 'A'. Mainly used by shift/rotate instructions. Examples: ASL A (shift A left), ROR A (rotate A right).

Accumulator		A

Some instructions (mainly the shift and rotate group) can be applied to data held in memory locations and also to data held in the accumulator.  You indicate the latter case by using A as your operand.

ASL	A	Shift the contents of the accumulator one bit to the left.
ROR	A	Rotate the contents of the accumulator one bit to the right.
