# Kick Assembler - Section 4.7: Character (char) values and usage in assembler (.byte with character literals, .text concatenation), chars as numeric sub-class (arithmetic on chars), and examples showing char arithmetic and char access from strings.

4.7. Char Values
Char values, or characters, are used like this:

Introducing the Script Language

lda #'H'
sta $0400
lda #'i'
sta $0401
lda #"?!#".charAt(1)
sta $0402
.byte 'H','e','l','l','o',' '
.text "World"+'!'

In the above example, chars are used in two ways. In the first examples their numeric representation are used
as arguments to the lda commands and in the final example, '!'s string representation is appended to the "World"
string.
Char values is a subclass of number values, which means that it has all the functions that are placed on the
number values, so you can do stuff like.
lda #’H’+1 // Same as lda #’I’
sta $0400
lda #’A’+1 // Same as lda #’B’
sta $0401
lda #’L’+1 // Same as lda #’M’
sta $0402
