# The MOS 6567/6569 video controller (VIC-II) and its application in the Commodore 64 - ECM=1, BMM=1, MCM=1 invalid bitmap mode 2: also yields a black screen; g-address bits 9 and 10 forced to zero (ECM), structure similar to multicolor bitmap but repeated segments. '01' treated as background; g-data results in black where combinations map to background/foreground black.

3.7.3.8. Invalid bitmap mode 2 (ECM/BMM/MCM=1/1/1)
--------------------------------------------------

The last invalid mode also creates a black screen but it can also be
"scanned" with sprite-graphics collisions.

The structure of the graphics is basically as in multicolor bitmap mode,
but the bits 9 and 10 of the g-addresses are always zero due to the set ECM
bit, with the same results as in the first invalid bitmap mode. As usual,
the bit combination "01" is part of the background.
