# C64 KERNAL API (Lee Davison) - $FF9C — Read/Set the bottom of memory. With carry=1 loads pointer to bottom-of-RAM into X/Y; with carry=0 saves X/Y as the bottom-of-memory pointer, changing available RAM base.

$FF9C          read/set the bottom of memory
               
               This routine is used to read and set the bottom of RAM. When this routine is
               called with the carry bit set the pointer to the bottom of RAM will be loaded
               into XY. When this routine is called with the carry bit clear XY will be saved as
               the bottom of memory pointer changing the bottom of memory.
