# ********* - QINT (convert FAC1 into a four-byte signed integer in memory locations 98-101), and INT (remove fractional part: call QINT then convert integer back to floating point). Covers the conversion of floating point values to integer form and back.

48283         $BC9B          QINT
Convert FAC1 into Integer Within FAC1

This routine converts the value in FAC1 into a four-byte signed
integer in 98- 101 ($62-$65), with the most significant byte first.

48332         $BCCC          INT
Perform INT

This routine removes the fractional part of a floating point number by
calling the routine above to change it to an integer, and then
changing the integer back to floating point format.
