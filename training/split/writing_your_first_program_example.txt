# COMMODORE 64 - Practical contrast of BASIC POKE vs machine language: CBM ASCII vs screen codes, POKE example to place 'A' on screen, then a step-by-step enter-and-assemble example using 64MON (.A assembly commands) building a tiny machine-language program (LDA #$01; STA $0400; LDA #$0E; STA $D800; BRK) and executing it with G command to display the result.

  WRITING YOUR FIRST PROGRAM

    If you've used the POKE statement in BASIC to put characters onto the
  screen, you're aware that the character codes for POKEing are different
  from CBM ASCII character values. For example, if you enter:

    PRINT ASC("A") (and press <RETURN> )


  the Commodore 64 will respond with:

    65

    READY.


  However, to put an "A" onto the screen by POKEing, the code is 1, enter:

    <SHIFT+CLR/HOME> to clear the screen

    POKE 1024,1:POKE 55296,14 (and <RETURN> (1024 is the start of screen
    memory)

  The "P" in the POKE statement should now be an "A."
    Now let's try this in machine language. Type the following in 64MON:
  (Your cursor should be flashing alongside a "." right now.)

    .A 1400 LDA#$01 (and press <RETURN>)





  220   BASIC TO MACHINE LANGUAGE
~


  The Commodore 64 will prompt you with:

    .A 1400 A9 01      LDA #$01
    .A 1402

  Type:

    .A 1402 STA $0400


  (The STA instruction stores the contents of the accumulator in a
  specified memory location.)
  The Commodore 64 will prompt you with:

    .A 1405

  Now type in:

    .A 1405 LDA #$0E
    .A 1407 STA $D800
    .A 140A BRK

  Clear the screen, and type:

    G 1400

    The G should turn into an "A" if you've done everything correctly. You
  have now written your first machine language program. Its purpose is to
  store one character ("A") at the first location in the screen memory.
  Having achieved this, we must now explore some of the other instructions,
  and principles.
