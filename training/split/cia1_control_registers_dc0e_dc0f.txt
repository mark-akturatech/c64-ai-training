# COMMODORE 64 - CIA #1 Control Register A (DC0E/$56334) and Control Register B (DC0F/$56335) definitions: DC0E bits for TOD frequency (50/60Hz), serial I/O direction, Timer A count source, force-load, one-shot vs continuous, output mode to PB6 (toggle/pulse), PB6 enable, and start/stop; DC0F bits for setting alarm/TOD behavior, Timer B mode select (count source options), and bits 4-0 mirroring DC0E functionality for Timer B. (Includes table header and a trailing blank line.)

                            7      Time-of-Day Clock Frequency: 1 = 50 Hz,
                                     0 = 60 Hz
                            6      Serial Port I/O Mode Output, 0 = Input

                            5      Timer A Counts: 1 = CNT Signals,
                                     0 = System 02 Clock
                            4      Force Load Timer A: 1 = Yes
                            3      Timer A Run Mode: 1 = One-Shot,
                                     0 = Continuous
                            2      Timer A Output Mode to PB6: 1 = Toggle,
                                     0 = Pulse
                            1      Timer A Output on PB6: 1 = Yes, 0 = No
                            0      Start/Stop Timer A: 1 = Start, 0 = Stop

  DC0F       56335                 CIA Control Register B
                            7      Set Alarm/TOD-Clock: 1 = Alarm,
                                     0 = Clock
                            6-5    Timer B Mode Select:
                                     00 = Count System 02 Clock Pulses
                                     01 = Count Positive CNT Transitions
                                     10 = Count Timer A Underflow Pulses
                                     11 = Count Timer A Underflows While
                                       CNT Positive
                            4-0    Same as CIA Control Reg. A - for Timer B
