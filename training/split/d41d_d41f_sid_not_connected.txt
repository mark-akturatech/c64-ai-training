# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $D41D-$D41F — Not Connected SID addresses: the SID supports 29 registers; remaining 3 addresses are not used and read as $FF with writes having no effect.

$D41D-$D41F               Not Connected

                          The SID chip has been provided with enough addresses for 32 different
                          registers, but as it has only 29, the remaining three addresses are
                          not used.  Reading them will always return a value of 255 ($FF), and
                          writing to them will have no effect.
