# byRiclianll - The SECTOR header and the initial portion of the hex/ASCII dump. Covers the header line '-  SECTOR' and the following dozen or so lines that include a small run of non-zero tokens and ASCII fragments (e.g. '1  jL', 'UO', 'y-wy%', 'FF', 'y-i.  y-.') interspersed with sequences of 00 bytes. This chunk shows how the sector dump begins and includes the first localized non-zero data before long padding runs begin.
