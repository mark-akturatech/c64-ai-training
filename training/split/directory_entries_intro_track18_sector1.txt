# byRiclianll - Introductory text for section 4.4: explains that bytes 0-1 of track 18 sector 0 point to the next directory block, states that the BAM points to track 18 sector 1, and labels the raw dump for the disk image ("1541 TEST /DEMO" and "TRACK 18 - SECTOR 01"). This chunk prepares the reader for the detailed sector dump that follows.

4.4  The  Directory  Entries 

Recall  that  bytes  0  and  1  of  track  18,  sector  0  point  to  the  next  track  and  sector  of  the 
directory.  In  this  particular  instance,  the  BAM  points  to  track  18,  sector  1.  Let's  ex- 
amine this  sector  in  detail.
