# Contents - Visibility limits: Y register values 0-255; an unexpanded sprite is fully visible if Y between $32 and $E9. X position is 9-bit (8 bits in X register + bit in XMSB $D010). Unexpanded sprite fully visible if 9-bit X value is > $18 and < $140. HINC/HDEC macros help handle 9-bit increments/decrements. Table 7-6 shows coordinates for fully visible normal/expanded sprites.




The value placed in the Y position register will 
specify the vertical position of the sprite on the 
screen. This value may be up to 255. For an unex- 
panded sprite to be completely visible, the Y value 
must be between $32 and $E9. Any other values 
will place the sprite partially off the screen. 

Whatever value is placed in the X position 
register is the least significant 8 bits of a 9 bit value. 
Each sprite has a ninth bit in the XMSB ($D010) 
register. An unexpanded sprite will be completely 
visible if the 9 bit X value is greater than $18 and 
less than $140. The HINC and HDEC macros can 
be used to perform 9 bit increments and decrements 
of the X position. 

Table 7-6 shows the screen coordinates for ex- 
panded and unexpanded sprites to be fully visible 
on the screen. Any sprite positions outside of 
these limits will be partially or fully off of the 
screen. This provides an easy way to reveal a 
sprite gradually.
