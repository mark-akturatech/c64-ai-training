# MACHINE - PENTOMINOS program: puzzle-solving machine-language program that fits pieces into a selected rectangular shape visibly (shows attempts on screen). The machine-language logic follows the BASIC program closely; shape tables are rearranged for machine-language convenience and pieces are indexed in a 0–255 range corresponding to piece and rotation. No indirect addressing and no subroutines (written to mirror BASIC). Program relocates to $156D (tables at $12FA) except B128 variant.

A puzzle solving problem.  Pieces are fitted into a selected rectangular
shape "visibly"--in other words, they may be seen on the screen as they are
tried.

The machine language programs follow the logic of the BASIC program
precisely.  The "shape tables" have been rearranged for greater machine
language convenience (each piece is reached by indexing; the index range of 0
to 255 dictates the piece being selected and its rotation).

The machine language program uses no indirect addressing and no subroutines.
That is not necessarily good practice; it is largely a result of writing the
program logic to exactly match the BASIC program.
