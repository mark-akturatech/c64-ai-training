# Contents - Covers support for expressions in data statements and the value of printouts that show calculated data values for verification; notes that once data is debugged, such detailed printouts are less necessary.

Since most assemblers allow you to use expres- 
sions in data statements, you should be able to get 
a printout of the calculated data. With such a listing, 
you can verify that the assembler generated the ex- 
pected data. Again, once you are familiar with the 
operation of your assembler and your data has been 
debugged you rarely need to see this part of the 
printout.
