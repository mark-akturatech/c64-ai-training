# SID 6581/8580 Sound Interface Device - Programming Guide - High-level overview of the SID chip (designer, platforms) and capabilities: 3 voices, 4 waveforms, 16-bit frequency, 12-bit pulse width, ADSR envelopes, ring modulation, sync, 4-bit master volume, multi-mode filter, ADC paddle inputs, external audio input.

1. OVERVIEW
================================================================================

The SID (Sound Interface Device) is a sound synthesis chip designed by Bob Yannes
at MOS Technology. It was used in the Commodore 64, C128, and CBM-II computers.
The SID combines analog and digital circuitry to produce a distinctive sound that
remains iconic in the chiptune and demoscene communities.

Capabilities:
  - 3 independent tone generators (voices) with 16-bit frequency control (0-4 kHz)
  - 4 waveforms per voice: sawtooth, triangle, rectangle/pulse, and noise
  - Variable pulse width modulation on rectangular waveform (12-bit, 0-100%)
  - 3 independent ADSR envelope generators (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release)
  - 3 amplitude modulators with up to 48 dB dynamic range
  - Oscillator synchronization between voice pairs
  - Ring modulation between voice pairs
  - Programmable multi-mode filter: low-pass, band-pass, high-pass (combinable)
  - Adjustable filter resonance (4-bit)
  - Master volume control (4-bit, 16 steps)
  - 2 analog-to-digital converters (8-bit) for paddle/potentiometer input
  - External audio input for mixing and filtering
