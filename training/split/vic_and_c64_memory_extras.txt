# MACHINE - Commodore 64 extra RAM at $C000-$CFFF (4K) often used by utilities; option to remove BASIC from C64 to reclaim $0801-$CFFF (~50K) via POKE $01,$36/ $01,$37 (be careful). On VIC machines, moving SOB pointer is common to make video space; ensure screen-related RAM limits when planning ML and video effects.

Extras for VIC and Commodore 64
-------------------------------

The Commodore 64 has a free block of RAM at locations $C000 to $CFFF (decimal
49152 to 53247).  That's 4k of RAM not being used; you may write your
programs there.  Before you do so, check to make sure that the memory is not
being used by any other programs.  It's a popular place in the Commodore 64,
and many utilities and commercial programs zero in on this available memory.

If you intend to write programs entirely in machine language, with no BASIC
content at all, you may completely remove BASIC from the Commodore 64 system
and claim the space as available RAM.  This gives you the whole block from
$0801 up to $CFFF for programs and data--a whopping 50K--and even more could
be liberated if necessary.  BASIC may be made to disappear from the Commodore
64 with the equivalent of POKE 1,54 (LDA #$36, STA $01).  It may be
reinstated with the equivalent of POKE 1,55 (LDA #$37, STA $01).  Be very
careful.  With BASIC gone, the computer doesn't even know how to say READY.

On all Commodore machines it's possible to move up the start-of-BASIC pointer
and use the space freed below.  To do so, it's essential to store a value of
zero in the location immediately before the new start-of-BASIC, and to align
all other pointers, usually by going to BASIC and commanding NEW.

This works, and will make as much space available as is needed.  BASIC
programs will relocate as they load.  But since the computer needs to be
reconfigured before the main program is loaded, and often needs to be
restored to its original configuration after the program is run, the method
is not popular in most Commodore machines.  It's used fairly often in the
VIC-20, however.

The video chip in the VIC-20 can "see" RAM memory only in the memory space
$0000 to $1FFF (decimal 0 to 8191).  Whatever variable information appears on
the screen must be taken from this memory area.  The VIC-20 can also get
information from $8000 to $9FFF, but there's no RAM there; we can't
manipulate this memory area.

                                                                         :97:

If we want to perform special visual effects on the VIC-20, we must
manipulate data in the area $0000 to $1FFF.  Let's look at what's available.
$0000 to $03FF is used by the "system;" other than the cassette buffer, we
must leave it alone.  $0400 to $0FFF contains no memory unless a 3K RAM
expansion is added.  $1000 to $1DFF contains the BASIC program, and $1E00 to
$1FFF is screen memory.  Details may vary, but the answer always comes out
the same:  there's no space to do our video effects.

A popular VIC-20 solution, especially where 8K or more of RAM expansion has
been added, is to increase the start-of-BASIC pointer, thus liberating space
in low memory.  This may now be used for visual effects and for machine
language programming, too, if any space is left over.  In the VIC-20, this
approach is necessary, but it's still a bit clumsy.
