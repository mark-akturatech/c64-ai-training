# COMMODORE 64 - KERNAL UDTIM (call $FFEA / 65514): Update the system clock. Normally called by IRQ every 1/60s. If user programs handle IRQs, they must call UDTIM to update time and maintain STOP key functionality. A,X not used; stack requirement: 2. Example: JSR UDTIM.

  B-36. Function Name: UDTIM

    Purpose: Update the system clock
    Call address: $FFEA (hex) 65514 (decimal)
    Communication registers: None
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns: None
    Stack requirements: 2
    Registers affected: A, X

    Description: This routine updates the system clock. Normally this
  routine is called by the normal KERNAL interrupt routine every 1/60th of
  a second. If the user program processes its own interrupts this routine
  must be called to update the time. In addition, the <STOP> key routine
  must be called, if the <STOP> key is to remain functional.

  How to Use:
    1) Call this routine.

  EXAMPLE:

    JSR UDTIM
                                            BASIC TO MACHINE LANGUAGE   303
