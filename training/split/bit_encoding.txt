# Datassette Encoding - How data bits and special markers are encoded using pairs of pulses: Bit 0 = short + medium, Bit 1 = medium + short. Additional markers: Byte marker = long + medium, End-of-data = long + short.

Bit Encoding
------------

Each data bit is encoded using a pair of pulses:

    Bit "0" = short pulse + medium pulse
    Bit "1" = medium pulse + short pulse

Additional signal markers:

    Byte marker     = long pulse + medium pulse
    End-of-data     = long pulse + short pulse
