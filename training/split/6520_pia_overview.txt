# MACHINE - 6520 Peripheral Interface Adapter (PIA) overview. Describes PIA as an I/O device that interfaces the microprocessor to peripherals via two 8-bit bi-directional data ports, an 8-bit microprocessor data bus, four interrupt/control lines, and logic for peripheral interrupts. Explains the PIA is programmed during system initialization and provides flexible peripheral control.

6520 Peripheral interface Adapter (PIA)
=======================================

The 6520 is an I/O device which acts as an interface between the
microprocessor and peripherals such as printers, displays, keyboards, etc.
The prime function of the 6520 is to respond to stimulus from each of the two
worlds it is serving.  On the one side, the 6520 is interfacing with
peripherals via two eight-bit bi-directional peripheral data ports.  On the
other side, the device interfaces with the microprocessor through an
eight-bit data bus.  In addition to the lines described above, the 6520
provides four interrupt input/peripheral control lines and the logic
necessary for simple, effective control of peripheral interrupts.
