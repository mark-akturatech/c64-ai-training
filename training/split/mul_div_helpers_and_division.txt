# ********* - MUL10 (multiply FAC1 by 10 — used when converting floats to ASCII), TENC (the constant 10 in five-byte FP format), DIV10 (divide FAC1 by 10), FDIV (move a memory number to FAC2 to prepare division), and FDIVT (divide FAC2 by FAC1 with division-by-zero check). Covers helpers for multiplying/dividing by 10 and the division routines that operate on FAC1/FAC2.

47842         $BAE2          MUL10
Multiply FAC1 by 10

This subroutine is called to help convert a floating point number to a
series of ASCII numerals.

47865         $BAF9          TENC
The Constant 10 in Five-Byte Floating Format

47870         $BAFE          DIV10
Divide FAC1 by 10

47887         $BB0F          FDIV
Divide a Number in Memory by FAC1

This number in memory is stored to FAC2, and this routine falls
through to the next.

47890         $BB12          FDIVT
Divide FAC2 by FAC1

This routine is used to divide the contents of FAC2 by the contents of
FAC1, with the result being stored in FAC1.  A check for division by 0
is made before dividing.
