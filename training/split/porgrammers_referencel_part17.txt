      KEY           COLOR                APPEARS AS

   <CTRL+1>         Black
   <CTRL+2>         White
   <CTRL+3>         Red
   <CTRL+4>         Cyan
   <CTRL+5>         Purple
   <CTRL+6>         Green
   <CTRL+7>         Blue
   <CTRL+8>         Yellow
   <C=+1>           Orange
   <C=+2>           Brown
   <C=+3>           Light Red
   <C=+4>           Grey 1
   <C=+5>           Grey 2
   <C=+6>           Light Green
   <C=+7>           Light Blue
   <C=+8>           Grey 3



    If you wanted to PRINT the word HELLO in cyan and the word THERE
  in white, type:

    PRINT "<CTRL+4>HELLO <CTRL+2>THERE"


  4. Insert Mode

    The spaces created by using the <INST/DEL> key have some of the same
  characteristics as quote mode. The cursor controls and color controls
  show up as reversed characters. The only difference is in the <INST> and
  <DEL>, which performs its normal function even in quote mode, now

  creates the <T>. And <INST>, which created a special character in quote
  mode, inserts spaces normally.
    Because of this, it is possible to create a PRINT statement containing
  DELetes, which cannot be PRINTed in quote mode. Here is an example
  of how this is done:

    10 PRINT"HELLO"<DEL><INST><INST><DEL><DEL>P"


    When the above line is RUN, the word displayed will be HELP, because
  the last two letters are deleted and the P is put in their place.

  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | WARNING: The DELetes will work when LISTing as well as PRINTing, so   |
  | editing a line with these characters will be difficult.               |
  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+


    The "insert mode" condition is ended when the <RETURN> (or
  <SHIFT+RETURN>) key is hit, or when as many characters have been typed as
  spaces were inserted.


  5. Other Special Characters

    There are some other characters that can be PRINTed for special
  functions, although they are not easily available from the keyboard. In
  order to get these into quotes, you must leave empty spaces for them in
  the line, hit <RETURN> or <SHIFT+RETURN>, and go back to the spaces with
  the cursor controls. Now you must hit <RVS ON>, to start typing reversed
  characters, and type the keys shown below:

          Function                    Type               Appears As

    <SHIFT+RETURN>                    <SHIFT+M>
    switch to lower case              <N>
    switch to upper case              <SHIFT+N>
    disable case-switching keys       <H>
    enable case-switching keys        <I>

    The <SHIFT+RETURN> will work in the LISTing as well as PRINTing, so
  editing will be almost impossible if this character is used. The LISTing
  will also look very strange.


  PRINT#

  TYPE: I/O Statement
  FORMAT: PRINT#<file-number>[<variable>][<,/;><variable>]...

    Actions: The PRINT# statement is used to write data items to a logical
  file. It must use the same number used to OPEN the file. Output goes to
  the device-number used in the OPEN statement. The <variable> expressions
  in the output-list can be of any type. The punctuation characters between
  items are the same as with the PRINT statement and they can be used in
  the same ways. The effects of punctuation are different in two
  significant respects.
    When PRINT# is used with tape files, the comma, instead of spacing
  by print zones, has the same effect as a semicolon. Therefore, whether
  blanks, commas, semicolons or no punctuation characters are used between
  data items, the effect on spacing is the same. The data items are written
  as a continuous stream of characters. Numeric items are followed by a
  space and, if positive, are preceded by a space.
    If no punctuation finishes the list, a carriage-return and a line-feed
  are written at the end of the data. If a comma or semicolon terminates
  the output-list, the carriage-return and line-feed are suppressed. Re-
  gardless of the punctuation, the next PRINT# statement begins output in
  the next available character position. The line-feed will act as a stop
  when using the INPUT# statement, leaving an empty variable when the next
  INPUT# is executed. The line-feed can be suppressed or compensated for as
  shown in the examples below.
    The easiest way to write more than one variable to a file on tape or
  disk is to set a string variable to CHR$(13), and use that string in be-
  tween all the other variables when writing the file.

  EXAMPLES of PRINT# Statement:


  1)

    10 OPEN 1,1,1,"TAPE FILE"
    20 R$=CHR$(13)                      (By Changing the CHR$(13) to
    30 PRINT#1,1;R$;2;R$;3;R$;4;R$;5     CHR$(44) you put a "," between
    40 PRINT#1,6                         each variable. CHR$(59) would
    50 PRINT# 1,7                        put a ";" between each variable.)


  2)

    10 CO$=CHR$(44):CR$=CHR$(13)
    20 PRINT#1,"AAA"CO$"BBB",           AAA,BBB     CCCDDDEEE
       "CCC";"DDD";"EEE"CR$             (carriage return)
       "FFF"CR$;                        FFF(carriage return)
    30 INPUT#1,A$,BCDE$,F$

  3)

     5 CR$=CHR$(13)
    10 PRINT#2,"AAA";CR$;"BBB"          (10 blanks) AAA
    20 PRINT#2,"CCC";                   BBB
                                        (10 blanks)CCC
    30 INPUT#2,A$,B$,DUMMY$,C$


  READ

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: READ <variable>[,<variable>]...

    Action: The READ statement is used to fill variable names from con-
  stants in DATA statements. The data actually read must agree with the
  variable types specified or the BASIC error message ?SYNTAX ERROR will
  result.(*) Variables in the DATA input-list must be separated by commas.
    A single READ statement can access one or more DATA statements,
  which will be accessed in order (see DATA), or several READ statements
  can access the same DATA statement. If more READ statements are executed
  than the number of elements in DATA statements(s) in the program, the

  76   BASIC LANGUAGE VOCABULARY
~


  BASIC error message ?OUT OF DATA is printed. If the number of variables
  specified is fewer than the number of elements in the DATA statement(s),
  subsequent READ statements will continue reading at the next data
  element. (See RESTORE.)

  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | *NOTE: The ?SYNTAX ERROR will appear with the line number from the    |
  | DATA statement, NOT the READ statement.                               |
  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

  EXAMPLES of READ Statement:

    110 READ A,B,C$
    120 DATA 1,2,HELLO

    100 FOR X=1 TO 10: READ A(X):NEXT

    200 DATA 3.08, 5.19, 3.12, 3.98, 4.24
    210 DATA 5.08, 5.55, 4.00, 3.16, 3.37

    (Fills array items (line 1) in order of constants shown (line 5))

    1 READ CITY$,STATE$,ZIP
    5 DATA DENVER,COLORADO, 80211


  REM

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: REM [<remark>]

    Action:The REM statement makes your programs more easily understood
  when LISTed. It's a reminder to yourself to tell you what you had in
  mind when you were writing each section of the program. For instance,
  you might want to remember what a variable is used for, or some other
  useful information. The REMark can be any text, word, or character
  including the colon (:) or BASIC keywords.
    The REM statement and anything following it on the same line-number
  are ignored by BASIC, but REMarks are printed exactly as entered when
  the program is listed. A REM statement can be referred to by a GOTO or
  GOSUB statement, and the execution of the program will continue with
  the next higher program line having executable statements.

  EXAMPLES of REM Statement:

    10 REM CALCULATE AVERAGE VELOCITY
    20 FOR X= 1 TO 20 :REM LOOP FOR TWENTY VALUES
    30 SUM=SUM + VEL(X): NEXT
    40 AVG=SUM/20



  RESTORE

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: RESTORE


    Action: BASIC maintains an internal pointer to the next DATA constant
  to be READ. This pointer can be reset to the first DATA constant in a
  program using the RESTORE statement. The RESTORE statement can be
  used anywhere in the program to begin re-READing DATA.


  EXAMPLES of RESTORE Statement:

    100 FOR X=1 TO 10: READ A(X): NEXT
    200 RESTORE
    300 FOR Y=1 TO 10: READ B(Y): NEXT

    4000 DATA 3.08, 5.19, 3.12, 3.98, 4.24
    4100 DATA 5.08, 5.55, 4.00, 3.16, 3.37

    (Fills the two arrays with identical data)

    10 DATA 1,2,3,4
    20 DATA 5,6,7,8
    30 FOR L= 1 TO 8
    40 READ A: PRINT A
    50 NEXT
    60 RESTORE
    70 FOR L= 1 TO 8
    80 READ A: PRINT A
    90 NEXT
