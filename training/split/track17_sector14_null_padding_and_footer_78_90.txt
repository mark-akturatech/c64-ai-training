# byRiclianll - Final portion of the TRACK 17 - SECTOR 14 dump covering offsets from roughly 0x70 onward up to the sector end. Shows the null-padding and 'OO' markers used by DOS for unused bytes, multiple zero bytes, and trailing filler up through offsets labeled 0x78, 0x80, 0x88, and 0x90. This chunk demonstrates DOS null-padding behavior at the end of a block when a fixed-length record crosses the block boundary.
