# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL ROM Disassembly (English, "CBM") - Local counters and motor control: sets FSBLK, calls NEWCH to prepare local counters/flags, turns cassette motor on via the R6510 port (enabling low bit), flags internal motor control (CAS1), runs a two-level delay loop to allow hardware settle, then enables interrupts (CLI).
