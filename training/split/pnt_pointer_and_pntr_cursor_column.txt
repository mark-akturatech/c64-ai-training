# ********* - PNT ($D1-$D2) and PNTR ($D3) — PNT is a two-byte pointer to the address in screen RAM of the first column of the logical line containing the cursor; PNTR stores the cursor column within that logical line (0–79). Explains use of these pointers for locating current logical line and that PNTR matches the value returned by POS. Mentions interaction with TBLX and the Kernal PLOT routine for cursor movement.

209-210       $D1-$D2        PNT
Pointer to the Address of the Current Screen Line

This location points to the address in screen RAM of the first column
of the logical line upon which the cursor is currently positioned.

211           $D3            PNTR
Cursor Column on Current Line

The number contained here is the cursor column position within the
logical line pointed to by 209 ($D1).  Since a logical line can
contain up to two physical lines, this value may be from 0 to 79 (the
number here is the value returned by the POS function).
