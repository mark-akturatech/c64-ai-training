# ********* - Section 4.7: VALIDATE command (PRINT#15,"VALIDATE" or "V") to re-organize a disk's directory and collect blocks from improperly closed files to free space; warning that VALIDATE deallocates blocks used by random files and thus should not be used on disks with random files.



4.7 VALIDATE

After a diskette has been in use for some time, the directory can
become disorganized.  When programs have been repeatedly SAVED and
SCRATCHed, they may leave numerous small gaps on the disk, a block
here and a few blocks there.  These blocks never get used because they
are too small to be useful.  The VALIDATE command will go in and re-
organize your diskette so that you can get the most from the available
space.

Also, there may be data files that were OPENed but never properly
CLOSED. This command will collect all blocks taken by such files and
make them available to the drive, since the files are unusable at that
point.

There is a danger in using this command.  When using random files (see
chapter 6), blocks allocated will be de-allocated by this command.
Therefore, this command should never be used with a diskette that uses
random files.

FORMAT FOR VALIDATE COMMAND:

   PRINT#15, "VALIDATE"

or abbreviated as

   PRINT#15, "V"
