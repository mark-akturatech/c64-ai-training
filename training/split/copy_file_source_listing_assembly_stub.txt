# byRiclianll - Assembler/source listing header and small assembly/PAL stub for the COPY utility: title 'COPY A FILE SOURCE LISTING', REM comments, an example OPEN2 command for creating the output file, a SYS40960 invocation, assembler directives (.OPT P,02) and an origin directive (* = *C000). This is the assembler-side companion to the BASIC and DATA machine-code pieces above.
