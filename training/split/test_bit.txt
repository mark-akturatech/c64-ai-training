# COMMODORE 64 - TEST (Bit 3): When set, resets and locks Oscillator 1 at zero until cleared. Also resets Noise output and holds Pulse output at a DC level. Primarily used for testing, but can synchronize Oscillator 1 to external events to allow generation of complex waveforms under real-time software control.

    TEST (Bit 3): The TEST bit, when set to a one, resets and locks Oscil-
  lator 1 at zero until the TEST bit is cleared. The Noise waveform output
  of Oscillator 1 is also reset and the Pulse waveform output is held at a
  DC level. Normally this bit is used for testing purposes, however, it can
  be used to synchronize Oscillator 1 to external events, allowing the
  generation of highly complex waveforms under real-time software control.
