# Analyzing C64 tape loaders - Introduces IRQ-based loaders (example: Terminator 2 loader study). Assumes reader familiarity with hardware interrupts and ISRs. Suggests comparing datasette framing to data-link layer protocols and mentions the plan to present an IRQ-based loader implementation and disassembly.

Formerly known as The study of loader used in Terminator 2.

==== Introduction ====

I'll assume you are familiar with hardware interrupts and ISRs (you don't absolutely require to know how they work on a C64, but a small knowledge about interrupts in general is enough).
If you know about any data-link layer networking protocol, it can be useful (for understanding things better) to compare the datasette to a network adapter. Import the problems of framing you have on the data-link layer (which is equivalent to our loader) and adapt them to our study.
