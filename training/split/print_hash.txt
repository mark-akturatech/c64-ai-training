# COMMODORE 64 - PRINT# file-number, items: writes data items to a logical file opened by OPEN. Output punctuation rules differ for tape files (comma behaves like semicolon); numeric items have leading and trailing spaces as on screen. Default termination behavior: if no punctuation ends list, CR+LF written; terminating comma/semicolon suppresses CR+LF. Examples include writing variables with CHR$(13) separators and constructing tape/disk output lines; demonstrates interplay with INPUT# for reading back.

    The <SHIFT+RETURN> will work in the LISTing as well as PRINTing, so
  editing will be almost impossible if this character is used. The LISTing
  will also look very strange.


  PRINT#

  TYPE: I/O Statement
  FORMAT: PRINT#<file-number>[<variable>][<,/;><variable>]...

    Actions: The PRINT# statement is used to write data items to a logical
  file. It must use the same number used to OPEN the file. Output goes to
  the device-number used in the OPEN statement. The <variable> expressions
  in the output-list can be of any type. The punctuation characters between
  items are the same as with the PRINT statement and they can be used in
  the same ways. The effects of punctuation are different in two
  significant respects.
    When PRINT# is used with tape files, the comma, instead of spacing
  by print zones, has the same effect as a semicolon. Therefore, whether
  blanks, commas, semicolons or no punctuation characters are used between
  data items, the effect on spacing is the same. The data items are written
  as a continuous stream of characters. Numeric items are followed by a
  space and, if positive, are preceded by a space.
    If no punctuation finishes the list, a carriage-return and a line-feed
  are written at the end of the data. If a comma or semicolon terminates
  the output-list, the carriage-return and line-feed are suppressed. Re-
  gardless of the punctuation, the next PRINT# statement begins output in
  the next available character position. The line-feed will act as a stop
  when using the INPUT# statement, leaving an empty variable when the next
  INPUT# is executed. The line-feed can be suppressed or compensated for as
  shown in the examples below.
    The easiest way to write more than one variable to a file on tape or
  disk is to set a string variable to CHR$(13), and use that string in be-
  tween all the other variables when writing the file.

  EXAMPLES of PRINT# Statement:


  1)

    10 OPEN 1,1,1,"TAPE FILE"
    20 R$=CHR$(13)                      (By Changing the CHR$(13) to
    30 PRINT#1,1;R$;2;R$;3;R$;4;R$;5     CHR$(44) you put a "," between
    40 PRINT#1,6                         each variable. CHR$(59) would
    50 PRINT# 1,7                        put a ";" between each variable.)


  2)

    10 CO$=CHR$(44):CR$=CHR$(13)
    20 PRINT#1,"AAA"CO$"BBB",           AAA,BBB     CCCDDDEEE
       "CCC";"DDD";"EEE"CR$             (carriage return)
       "FFF"CR$;                        FFF(carriage return)
    30 INPUT#1,A$,BCDE$,F$

  3)

     5 CR$=CHR$(13)
    10 PRINT#2,"AAA";CR$;"BBB"          (10 blanks) AAA
    20 PRINT#2,"CCC";                   BBB
                                        (10 blanks)CCC
    30 INPUT#2,A$,B$,DUMMY$,C$
