# NMOS 6510 - Unintended opcodes that combine STA/STX/STY behavior with additional masking of the high byte: SHA stores A & X & H into memory, SHX stores X & H, SHY stores Y & H (H = high byte of address + 1).

TAS {addr} stores A & X into SP and A & X & H into {addr}
LAS {addr} stores {addr} & SP into A, X and SP

No effect
Bit configuration does not allow any operation on these ones:
