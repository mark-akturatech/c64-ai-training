# ********* - Convert a floating-point number to a signed integer in the A (high byte) and Y (low byte) registers. Describes a routine (address $B1AA) that calls AYINT to range-check and convert the Floating Point Accumulator to a 16-bit signed integer in locations $64-$65, leaving high byte in A and low byte in Y. Notes that the vector at locations 3-4 points to this routine so it can be used by user USR calls. Includes the trailing blank line.

Convert a Floating Point Number to a Signed Integer in .A and .Y Registers

This subroutine calls AYINT, below, which checks to make sure that the
number in the Floating Point Accumulator is between 32767 and -32768,
and converts it to a 16-bit signed integer in 100-101 ($64-$65), high
byte first.  It leaves the high byte of the integer in the
Accumulator, and the low byte in the .Y register.

Although this routine does not appear to be referenced anywhere in
BASIC, the vector at locations 3-4 points to its address.  Presumably,
it is provided for the benefit of the user who wishes to pass
parameters in a USR call, or the like.
