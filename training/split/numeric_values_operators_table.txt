# Kick Assembler - All operator entries from Table 4.1. Covers: Unary minus (symbol -, description: inverts sign), binary arithmetic (plus +, minus -, multiply *, divide / with examples and brief descriptions), byte extraction operators (high byte '>' and low byte '<' with examples and descriptions), bit shifts (<<, >> with examples and descriptions), and bitwise operations (and &, or |, exclusive-or ^, not ~ with examples and explanations).

Unary minus

-

Plus

+

10+2 = 12

Adds two numbers.

Minus

-

10-8=2

Subtracts two numbers.

Multiply

*

2*3 =6

Multiply two numbers.

Divide

/

10/2 = 5

Divides two numbers.

High byte

>

>$1020 = $10

Returns the second byte of
a number.

Low byte

<

<$1020 = $20

Returns the first byte of a
number.

Bitshift left

<<

2<<2 = 8

Shifts the bits by a given number of spaces to the
left.

Bitshift right

>>

2>>1=1

Shifts the bits by a given number of spaces to the
right.

Bitwise and

&

$3f & $0f = $f

Performs bitwise and between two numbers.

Bitwise or

|

$0f | $30 = $3f

Performs a bitwise or between two numbers.

Bitwise eor

^

$ff ^ $f0 = $0f

Performs a bitwise exclusive or between two numbers.

Bitwise not

~

~%11 = %...11111100

Performs bitwise negation
of the bits.

Inverts the sign of a number.
