$00A3   EOI Switch              EOI delay or datasette bit counter
$00A4   Byte Buffer             Serial bus or datasette input buffer
$00A5   Bit Counter             Serial bus/datasette bit counter
$00A6   Buffer Offset           Current byte offset in datasette buffer
$00A7   RS232 Bit Buffer        Bit buffer during RS232 input
$00A8   RS232 Bit Cnt           Bit counter during RS232 input
$00A9   Stop Bit Switch         RS232 stop bit indicator
$00AA   RS232 Byte Buf          Byte buffer during RS232 input
$00AB   RS232 Parity            RS232 parity or datasette checksum
$00AC-$00AD  SAVE Start         Start address or pointer for save/load
$00AE-$00AF  Load Address       Address read from file or end pointer
$00B0-$00B1  Unused
