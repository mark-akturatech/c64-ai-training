# byRiclianll - Assembly definitions for disk M-R / M-W commands and the M-R entry point (lines 'DISK M-R' through the initial M-R entry code). Defines ASCII command labels for 'M-R' and 'M-W', a TEMP byte sequence, and begins the 'READ FROM DISK ROUTINES' section. Provides the M-R entry code that initializes the POINT pointer (LDA #*00; STA POINT; STA MR+3) and contains the comment 'ASK FOR FIRST HALF' — the listing stops mid-routine at line 21600.
