# Kick Assembler - Section 5.5: .while directive usage — loop while a boolean expression is true, examples printing numbers and manual iteration using .eval inside the loop body.

With the for loop you can quickly generate tables and unroll loops. You can, for example, do a classic ‘blitter
fill’ routine like this:
.var blitterBuffer=$3000
.var charset=$3800
.for (x=0;x<16;x++) {
.for(var y=0;y<128;y++) {
if (var y=0) lda blitterBuffer+x*128+y
else
eor blitterBuffer+x*128+y
sta charset+x*128+y
}
}

5.5. The .while directive
The .while directive executes as long as a given expressions is true. That is, it works like a .for-loop but without
the init and iteration parameters:
// Print the numbers from 0 to 9
.var i=0
.while(i<10) {
.print i;
.eval i++;
}
