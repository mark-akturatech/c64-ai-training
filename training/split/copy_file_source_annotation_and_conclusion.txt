# byRiclianll - Annotation and short commentary following the COPY machine-code listing. Contains a one-line annotation: 'This routine emulates a LOAD and SAVE from machine language.' Followed by the 'Conclusion' section opening paragraphs emphasizing studying the listings and noting the sophistication of the DOS protection-related programming techniques. (Narrative commentary; contextualizes the preceding listing.)


Copy  a  File  Source  Annotation 

This  routine  emulates  a  LOAD  and  SAVE  from  machine  language. 


Conclusion 

In  conclusion,  we  hope  that  this  chapter  has  taken  some  of  the  mystery  out  of  DOS  pro- 
tection schemes.  We  encourage  serious  readers  to  study  the  program  listings  carefully. 
The  programming  techniques  employed  are  perhaps  the  most  sophisticated  applications 
of  Commodore's  direct-access  commands  that  you  will  ever  see.
