# byRiclianll - User interaction and drive initialization sequence for the certifier. Includes warning and confirmation PRINTs, input loop waiting for RETURN, opening the DOS command channel (OPEN 15,8,15), issuing the '10' command to query DOS, and handling the initial response (INPUT#15, EN*, EM*, ET*, ES*). Ends with an early exit if DOS query fails.
