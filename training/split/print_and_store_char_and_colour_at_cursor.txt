# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Print routine: copies the character (A) to Y (TAY), initializes a cursor countdown ($CD) for repeat timing, calculates the colour-RAM pointer (JSR $EA24), restores the character (TYA), then saves the character at the cursor column via STA ($D1),Y and stores the colour from X (TXA -> STA ($F3),Y). Returns (RTS).

                                *** print character A and colour X
.,EA13 A8       TAY             copy the character
.,EA14 A9 02    LDA #$02set the count to $02, usually $14 ??
.,EA16 85 CD    STA $CD         save the cursor countdown
.,EA18 20 24 EA JSR $EA24       calculate the pointer to colour RAM
.,EA1B 98       TYA             get the character back

                                *** save the character and colour to the screen @ the cursor
.,EA1C A4 D3    LDY $D3         get the cursor column
.,EA1E 91 D1    STA ($D1),Y     save the character from current screen line
.,EA20 8A       TXA             copy the colour to A
.,EA21 91 F3    STA ($F3),Y     save to colour RAM
.,EA23 60       RTS
