# byRiclianll - Introduces the Scratch (delete) command, defines an unclosed file (directory entry with zero blocks and file-type preceded by '*'), and shows the basic syntax to scratch a file from BASIC: OPEN 15,8,15; PRINT#15,"SO:FILE NAME"; CLOSE 15. Includes the alternate shorthand PRINT* 15,"S:FILE NAME", a worked example and DOS 5.1 prompt examples.

The  Scratch  Command 

To  get  rid  of  an  unwanted  file,  we  scratch  it.  The  only  exception  is  an  unclosed  file. 
An  unclosed  file  is  one  that  appears  in  the  directory  as  having  zero  blocks  and  whose 
file  type  is  preceded  by  an  asterisk  (*SEQ,  *PRG,  etc.).  This  will  be  explained  below. 
To  scratch  a  file,  first  remove  the  write  protect  tab  and  key  in: 

SYNTAX:  OPEN   15,    8,  15 

PRINT#15,    "SO: FILE  NAME" 
CLOSE  15 


ALTERNATE:    PRINT* 15,    "S:FILE  NAME" 

EXAMPLE:        OPEN   15,    8,  15 

PRINT#15,  "SO: TESTING  123" 
CLOSE  15 


dos  5.1:      >so:file  name 
>s:file  name
