# ca65 Users Guide - The -Wn option: set assembler warning level (default 1). Example: -W2 enables warnings for items such as unused imported symbols. Lower than 1 is discouraged.

-Wn
Set the warning level for the assembler. Using -W2 the assembler will even warn about such things like unused imported symbols. The default warning level is 1, and it would probably be silly to set it to something lower.
