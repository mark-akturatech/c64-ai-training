# NMOS 6510 - Undocumented ISC (also called ISB/INS) instruction: entries for absolute indexed addressing modes (abs,X and abs,Y) with opcode bytes ($FF for ISC abs,X and $FB for ISC abs,Y). Includes the cycle/size/flags layout and the operation semantics: increment memory by one, then subtract memory from the accumulator with borrow (behaves exactly like INC followed by SBC, with SBC inheriting decimal-mode behavior). Lists test program filenames for verifying CPU and decimal-mode behavior (CPU/decimalmode/isc00.prg through isc13.prg).

Operation: Increase memory by one, then subtract memory from accumulator (with borrow).
This instruction works exactly like INC followed by SBC, with SBC inheriting the decimal mode as
described above.
