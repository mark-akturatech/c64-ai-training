# Contents - Explains that hex digits 0–9 match decimal up to 9, and values 10–15 are represented by letters A–F in hexadecimal. States the convention used in the book (and by most 6502 assemblers) to prefix hex numbers with a dollar sign ($). Clarifies that numbers without $ are assumed decimal unless they contain A–F (which would indicate a notation mistake).

You may notice that until the tenth value, (the 
number 9) the same numbers are used in both hex 
and decimal numbering systems. In hex however, 
the next 6 numbers are represented by the first 6 
letters in the alphabet. 

From this point forward, all hex numbers will 
be preceded by a dollar sign ($) to differentiate a 
hex number from a decimal number. This is the 
standard notation used by virtually all assemblers 
that assemble code for the 6500 series of 
microprocessors. If there is no $ preceding a 
number, it is assumed to be a decimal number, 
unless it contains any of the letters A-F, in which 
case you can assume that a mistake has been made.
