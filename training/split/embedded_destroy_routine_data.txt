# byRiclianll - Embedded machine-code bytes (DATA statements) that implement the destructive routine uploaded to the 1541: REM DESTROY A SECTOR followed by a sequence of DATA statements containing the assembled 6502 opcodes/bytes. These bytes are the payload written into the drive memory and executed to overwrite a disk sector. This chunk provides the exact byte sequence used by the BASIC driver.
