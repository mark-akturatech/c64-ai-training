# Commodore IEC Serial Bus Protocol Reference - pagetable.com - Secondary addressing (channels): secondary addresses (0-31) select channels within devices. Commands may select a secondary after TALK or LISTEN. Disk drives ignore bit 4 of SA so channels 16-31 map to 0-15.

Secondary Addressing (Channels):
  Secondary addresses (0-31) enable "channels" within devices. Commands
  specify which secondary address to use after TALK or LISTEN, though this
  remains optional.

  For disk drives, bit 4 of the secondary address is ignored, making
  channels 16-31 equivalent to 0-15.
