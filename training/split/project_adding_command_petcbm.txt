# MACHINE - Appendix E Project: Adding a Command — PET/CBM notes. Explains that adding a BASIC command on PET/CBM is nontrivial: no neat link at $0308/9; would require overwriting part of the CHRGET routine ($0070-$0087), supplying replacement code, then inserting the new features. The book omits the full PET/CBM equivalent implementation.

Project:  Adding a Command
==========================


PET/CBM Version
---------------

It's not possible to write a comparable program to add a command to the
PET/CBM.  This machine doesn't have a "link" neatly waiting for us at address
$0308/9.  Equivalent code would need to be somewhat longer and less elegant.

The equivalent program for PET/CBM won't be given here.  It would involve
writing over part of the CHRGET program (at $0070 to $0087), supplying
replacement code for the part we have destroyed, and then adding the new
features.
