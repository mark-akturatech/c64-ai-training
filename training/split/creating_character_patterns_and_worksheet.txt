# COMMODORE 64 - Describes the Programmable Character Worksheet: an 8x8 grid where each column value is a power of two (128..1). Explains how to mark dots, compute the decimal value for each row (sum of marked column values), produce 8 numbers (0-255) for a character, and place them into DATA statements. Includes hint: vertical lines should be at least 2 dots wide to reduce CHROMA noise on TV.

    The Programmable Character Worksheet (Figure 3-1) will help you design
  your own characters. There is an 8 by 8 matrix on the sheet, with row
  numbers, and numbers at the top of each column. (if you view each row as
  a binary word, the numbers are the value of that bit position. Each is a
  power of 2. The leftmost bit is equal to 128 or 2 to the 7th power, the
  next is equal to 64 or 2 to the 6th, and so on, until you reach the
  rightmost bit (bit 0) which is equal to 1 or 2 to the 0 power.)
    Place an X on the matrix at every location where you want a dot to be
  in your character. When your character is ready you can create the DATA
  statement for your character.
    Begin with the first row. Wherever you placed an X, take the number at
  the top of the column (the power-of-2 number, as explained above) and
  write it down. When you have the numbers for every column of the first
  row, add them together. \Mite this number down, next to the row. This is
  the number that you will put into the DATA statement to draw this row.
    Do the same thing with all of the other rows (1-7). When you are
  finished you should have 8 numbers between 0 and 255. If any of your
  numbers are not within range, recheck your addition. The numbers must be
  in this range to be correct! If you have less than 8 numbers, you missed
  a row. It's OK if some are 0. The 0 rows are just as important as the
  other numbers.
    Replace the numbers in the DATA statement in line 20 with the numbers
  you just calculated, and RUN the program. Then type a T. Every time you
  type it, you'll see your own character!
    If you don't like the way the character turned out, just change the
  numbers in the DATA statement and re-RUN the program until you are happy
  with your character.
    That's all there is to it!

  | HINT: For best results, always make any vertical lines in your        |
  | characters at least 2 dots (bits) wide. This helps prevent CHROMA     |
  | noise (color distortion) on your characters when they are displayed   |
  | on a TV screen.                                                       |
