# Kick Assembler - Section 2.3: Command-line options and config file KickAss.cfg usage, example settings (-showmem, -execute), comment rules in config file and environment/path notes for Java on Windows.

2.3. Configuring the Assembler
Kick Assembler has a lot of command line options (a summary is given in Appendix A, Quick Reference).
For example, if you assemble your program with the –showmem option you will get a memorymap shown after
assembling:
java –jar kickass.jar –showmem myCode.asm

By placing a file called KickAss.cfg in the same folder as the KickAss.jar, you can set command line options
that are used at every assembling. Lets say you always wants to have shown a memorymap after assembling and
then have the result executed in the C64 emulator VICE. Then you write the following in the KickAss.cfg file:
-showmem
-execute “c:/c64/winvice/x64.exe –confirmexit”
# This is a comment

(Replace c:/c64/winvice/ with a path that points to the vicefolder on your machine)
All lines starting with # are treated as comments.
