# COMMODORE 64 - KERNAL OPEN (call $FFC0 / 65472): open a logical file. Preparatory routines required: SETLFS, SETNAM. Error returns: 1,2,4,5,6,240 and READST. A,X,Y registers affected. Example implements BASIC 'OPEN 15,8,15,"I/O"' by calling SETNAM, SETLFS, then JSR OPEN.

  B-18. Function Name: OPEN


    Purpose: Open a logical file
    Call address: $FFC0 (hex) 65472 (decimal)
    Communication registers: None
    Preparatory routines: SETLFS, SETNAM
    Error returns: 1,2,4,5,6,240, READST
    Stack requirements: None
    Registers affected: A, X, Y

    Description: This routine is used to OPEN a logical file. Once the
  logical file is set up, it can be used for input/output operations. Most
  of the I/O KERNAL routines call on this routine to create the logical
  files to operate on. No arguments need to be set up to use this routine,
  but both the SETLFS and SETNAM KERNAL routines must be called before
  using this routine.


  How to Use:

    0) Use the SETLFS routine.
    1) Use the SETNAM routine.
    2) Call this routine.

  EXAMPLE:

    This is an implementation of the BASIC statement: OPEN 15,8,15,"I/O"


          LDA #NAME2-NAME    ;LENGTH OF FILE NAME FOR SETLFS
          LDY #>NAME         ;ADDRESS OF FILE NAME
          LDX #<NAME
          JSR SETNAM
          LDA #15
          LDX #8
          LDY #15
          JSR SETLFS
          JSR OPEN
    NAME  .BYT 'I/O'
