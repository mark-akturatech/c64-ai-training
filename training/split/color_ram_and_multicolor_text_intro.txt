# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Color RAM basics: one nybble per character starting at $D800 (55296), color selection per-character; introduction to multicolor text mode enabled by Bit 4 of $D016 (53270) and use of Background Color Registers 1 and 2 ($D022-$D023 / 53282-53283).


                          The color of each character is determined by one nybble of the Color
                          RAM which starts at 55296 ($D800).  There are, however, two variations
                          which alter this scheme somewhat.

                          The first is called multicolor text mode, and is set by Bit 4 of 53270
                          ($D016).  Instead of each bit selecting either the foreground or the
                          background color for each dot in the character, bit-pairs are used to
                          select one of four colors for each double-width dot.  This results in
                          the horizontal resolution being cut to four dots across per character,
                          but allows two extra colors to be introduced from Background Color
                          Registers 1 and 2 (53282-53283, $D022-$D023).
