# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Warning: graphics placed in $1000-$1FFF or $9000-$9FFF may appear to use standard CBM charset because VIC will always see the ROM charset in these areas; do not place custom charsets/sprite data there.

Graphics at $1000 or $9000
If your sprites (bitmaps, charsets etc.) look like they get their data from the standard CBM charset, you've probably put them in the memory between $1000 and $1fff or $9000 and $9fff. You can't use these areas for graphics, because whatever you do, the VIC will always see the standard charset in these areas. This is probably why the music is almost always placed at $1000...
