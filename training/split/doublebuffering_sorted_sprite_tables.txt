# Sprite Multiplexing Techniques by Cadaver (Lasse Oorni) - Doublebuffering the sorted sprite table: allocate twice the space (e.g., for 24 sprites reserve 48) and alternate buffers—while raster IRQs display buffer A, main program sorts into buffer B. Simplifies avoiding tearing/glitches. Note: unsorted (main) sprite arrays should remain single-buffered for simplicity.

2.5 Doublebuffering

This too isn't too complicated. Reserve twice as much space for the sorted
sprite arrays (for example, if you use 24 sprites, reserve space for 48). When
the raster interrupts are displaying sprites 0-23, you can modify sprites 24-47
and vice versa. This makes the code a bit more complicated but it isn't a
great pain overall.

To keep the main program simple, the unsorted sprite arrays shouldn't be
doublebuffered.

- "raster_interrupt_optimizations_and_unrolled_code" which expands on raster IRQs must know which buffer (screen) to write to when doublebuffered
