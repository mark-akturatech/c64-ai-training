# A Minimal C64 Datasette Program Loader - Purpose and context of the minimal datasette loader: compact cassette tape loader for the C64, decodes Datasette format without error correction, fits under 200 bytes, intended for use in space-constrained custom KERNALs to retain cassette compatibility.


Overview
--------

This article explains how to write a compact cassette tape loader for the
Commodore 64 that decodes the Datasette format without error correction.
The implementation fits under 200 bytes of assembly code.

Though the C64 KERNAL includes tape-loading code, it is common to create
modified versions of the KERNAL that add features, removing the original
tape code to create some space. This minimal loader provides a way to
retain cassette compatibility in space-constrained custom kernals.
