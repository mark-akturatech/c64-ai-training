# byRiclianll - Write the modified LOW and HIGH bytes back into the drive buffer with a DOS memory-write (M-W) to the correct buffer offsets, then issue the DOS 'U2' command to write the buffer back to disk. Prints/requests the M-W sequence (including CHR$ wrappers), sends the U2 command, reads the drive status via INPUT#15,EN*,EM*,ET*,ES*, and branches on success or failure.
