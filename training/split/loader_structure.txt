# Analyzing C64 tape loaders - Compact summary of the IRQ loader structure: Threshold $027C clock cycles (TAP $50), Endianess MSbF, Pilot Byte $40, Sync/Start payload byte $5A. Header layout: 1 unused, 2-byte load address (LSB first), 2-byte end address+1 (LSB first). Data includes 1-byte XOR checksum. Also notes code mapping for bit0/bit1.


It should now be clear that this loader has the following structure:

<code>
Threshold: $027C clock cycles (Tap value=$50)
Endianess: MSbF

Pilot Byte: $40
Start of payload Byte (1): $5A

Header:

  1 byte: unused
  2 bytes: Load address (LSBF)
  2 bytes: End address+1 (LSBF)

Data:

  1 byte: XOR checksum

(1) better known as "Sync Byte".
