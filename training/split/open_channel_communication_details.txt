# byRiclianll - Details about logical file number vs channel number: logical file number (C64 side) passes GET#/PRINT# data to the 1541 channel number; they need not match. The channel number only appears in direct-access commands. Using mnemonic file/channel numbers is optional. Example described for opening logical file 1 to channel 14, etc.

We  will  begin  our  tutorial  on  direct-access  programming  with  a  quick  review  of  the  1541 
format  explained  in  Chapter  3.  The  table  below  outlines  the  range  of  track  and  sector 
numbers  found  on  a  diskette. 


Zone  Track  Sector  Range  Number  of  Sectors 

1  1-17  0  -  20  21 

2  18-24  0-18  19 

3  25  -  30  0  -  17  18 

4  31  -  35  0  -  16  17 


NOTE:  If  you  attempt  to  access  a  track  less  than  1,  a  track  greater  than  35,  or  a  sector 
out  of  range  for  a  given  track,  you  will  get  a  DOS  error  message  number  66,  ILLEGAL 
TRACK  OR  SECTOR.
