# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - D011 Bit 3: selects a 24-row or 25-row text display (1=25 rows, 0=24 rows). Shortened display hides top/bottom row(s) under border to aid vertical fine scrolling by covering lines where new data is introduced.

                          Bit 3.  This bit register allows you to select either the normal
                          25-line text display (by setting the bit to 1), or a shortened 24-row
                          display (by resetting that bit to 0).  This shortened display is
                          created by extending the border to overlap the top or bottom row.  The
                          characters in these rows are still there; they are just covered up.

                          The shortened display is designed to aid vertical fine scrolling.  It
                          covers up the line into which new screen data is introduced, so that
                          the viewer does not see the new data being moved into place.

                          However, unlink the register at 53270 ($D016) which shortens the
                          screen by one character space on either side to aid horizontal
                          scrolling in either direction, this register can blank only one
                          vertical line at a time.  In order to compensate, it blanks the top
                          line when the three scroll bits in this register are set to 0, and
                          shifts the blanking one scan line at a time as the value of thee bits
                          increases.  Thus the bottom line is totally blanked when these bits
                          are set to 7.
