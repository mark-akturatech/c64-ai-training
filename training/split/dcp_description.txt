# NMOS 6510 - Start of DCP (also called DCM) undocumented opcode description: combination of DEC and CMP applied to the same addressing mode. Contains opcode/mnemonic listing (e.g. $C7 DCP zp, $D7 ...), description of sub-instructions (DEC, CMP), the effective function ({addr} = {addr} - 1 then A cmp {addr}), size and cycle count fields, and status flag effects layout.
