# Contents - Describes per-sprite color registers: there are eight sprite color registers (one per sprite), each can select any of the 16 palette colors. Includes the names and addresses of the registers: SPRCLO $D027, SPRCL1 $D028, SPRCL2 $D029, SPRCL3 $D02A, SPRCL4 $D02B, SPRCL5 $D02C, SPRCL6 $D02D, SPRCL7 $D02E. Also explains that set bits in a sprite definition display the sprite color while clear bits are transparent.

Setting the sprite color. There are eight 
registers that are used to hold color information, one 
for each sprite. Any of the 16 available colors may 
be selected for each sprite. Each bit that is set in 
the sprite definition will cause a pixel to be displayed 
in the sprite color. If the bit is clear, the pixel will 
be transparent. The sprite color registers are:
