# COMMODORE 64 - Memory interface differences between the two VIC-II versions: the 6566 provides thirteen fully decoded address outputs for direct system bus connection; the 6567 uses multiplexed addresses for direct connection to 64K DRAMs, presenting A06-A00 with /RAS low and A13-A08 on A05-A00 with /CAS low; notes that A11-A07 are static outputs on the 6567 to support ROM connection and that lower-order address latching is required for multiplexed outputs.

  MEMORY INTERFACE

    The two versions of the video interface chip, 6566 and 6567, differ in
  address output configurations. The 6566 has thirteen fully decoded

  addresses for direct connection to the system address bus. The 6567 has
  multiplexed addresses for direct connection to 64K dynamic RAMS. The
  least significant address bits, A06-A00, are present on A06-A00 while
  /RAS is brought low, while the most significant bits, A13-A08, are pres-
  ent on A05-A00 while /CAS is brought low. The pins A11-A07 on the 6567
  are static address outputs to allow direct connection of these bits to a
  conventional 16K (2K*8) ROM. (The lower order addresses require external
  latching.)
