# MACHINE - Introduction to the three logical operations that work on the A register: AND (logical AND), ORA (logical OR), and EOR (exclusive OR). Notes on commutativity, the 'value and mask' mental model, and the per-bit independent operation of these instructions making them ideal for extracting or manipulating bits.

Logical Operations
------------------

Three instructions perform what are called logical operations.  They are:
AND (Logical AND); ORA (Logical OR); and EOR (Exclusive OR).  These
instructions work on the A register only.

                                                                         :48:

Mathematicians describe these operations as commutative.  For example, a
value of $3A "AND" $57 gives exactly the same result as $57 "AND" $3A.  The
order doesn't matter.  But we often use these functions--and think of them--
in a particular order.  It's the same as with addition, where we think of a
"total" to which is added an "amount" to make a "new total."  With the
logical operators we often think of a "value," which we manipulate with a
"mask" to make a "modified value."

Logical operators work in such a way that each bit within a byte is treated
independently of all the other bits.  This makes these instructions ideal for
extracting bits, or manipulating certain bits while leaving others alone.

We'll look at formal definitions, but the following intuitive concepts are
useful to programmers:

  AND--turns bits off.

  ORA--turns bits on.

  EOR--flips bits over.
