# CIA 6526 Complex Interface Adapter - Comprehensive Reference - Timer B (TBLO/TBHI) at offsets $06/$07: a 16-bit down-counter operating similarly to Timer A but with additional count sources. Timer B input mode (CRB bits 5-6) selects PHI2, CNT edges, Timer A underflow pulses, or Timer A underflows coincident with CNT positive edge. On underflow Timer B can trigger an interrupt and toggle/pulse PB7. Timer A and B can be cascaded to form a 32-bit timer (Timer B counts Timer A underflows).

5.5  Timer B (TBLO/TBHI) - Offsets $06/$07
-------------------------------------------------------------

Timer B is a 16-bit down-counter (low byte at $06, high byte at $07).

Operates identically to Timer A with additional count sources.

Timer B can count:
  - System clock pulses (PHI2)
  - Positive edges on CNT pin
  - Timer A underflow pulses
  - Timer A underflows coincident with CNT positive edge
  (Selected by bits 5-6 of CRB)

On underflow, Timer B can:
  - Trigger an interrupt (if enabled in ICR)
  - Toggle or pulse bit 7 of Port B (if enabled in CRB)

Timer A and Timer B can be linked (cascaded) to form a 32-bit
timer by setting Timer B to count Timer A underflows.
