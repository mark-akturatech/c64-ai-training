# COMMODORE 64 - PRINT statement introduction: type, format, action, output-list basics, punctuation roles (blanks, commas, semicolons), 80-character logical line divided into eight 10-character zones, and how commas/semicolons position the next printed item (ends with the note that two exceptions follow).

  PRINT

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: PRINT [<variable>][<,/;><variable>]...

    Action: The PRINT statement is normally used to write data items to
  the screen. However, the CMD statement may be used to re-direct that
  output to any other device in the system. The <variable(s)> in the
  output-list are expressions of any type. If no output-list is present, a
  blank line is printed. The position of each printed item is determined by
  the punctuation used to separate items in the output-list.
    The punctuation characters that you can use are blanks, commas, or
  semicolons. The 80-character logical screen line is divided into 8 print
  zones of 10 spaces each. In the list of expressions, a comma causes the
  next value to be printed at the beginning of the next zone. A semicolon
  causes the next value to be printed immediately following the previous
  value. However, there are two exceptions to this rule:
