# NMOS 6510 - Documentation for the undocumented RRA (also called RRD) instruction: shows the abs,X and abs,Y opcode listings, the operation description (performs a memory ROR then ADC to the accumulator; ADC inherits decimal-mode behavior), and references to test programs (CPU/decimalmode/rra00.prg ... rra13.prg).

Operation: Rotate one bit right in memory, then add memory to accumulator (with carry).
This instruction works exactly like ROR followed by ADC, with ADC inheriting the decimal mode
as described above.
Test code: CPU/decimalmode/rra00.prg CPU/decimalmode/rra01.prg
CPU/decimalmode/rra02.prg CPU/decimalmode/rra03.prg
CPU/decimalmode/rra10.prg CPU/decimalmode/rra11.prg
CPU/decimalmode/rra12.prg CPU/decimalmode/rra13.prg
