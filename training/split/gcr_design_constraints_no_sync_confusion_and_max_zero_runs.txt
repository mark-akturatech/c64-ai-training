# byRiclianll - Two key properties of the 1541 binary→GCR mapping: (1) no pair of 5-bit GCR codes can produce 10 consecutive '1' bits (preventing data being mistaken for the sync mark), and (2) no more than two consecutive '0' bits appear in any 10-bit GCR byte or combination (helpful for clock recovery when reading).

Two  things  should  stand  out  when  scrutinizing  the  1541's  binary  to  GCR  lookup  table. 

1.  No  combination  of  any  two  5-bit  GCR  bytes  will  ever  yield  10  consecutive  on  bits 
(Is)  which  is  used  as  the  sync  mark.  Binary  to  GCR  conversion  eliminates  all  likelihood 
that  a  permutation  of  normal  data  bytes  can  ever  be  mistaken  by  the  read/write  elec- 
tronics for  a  sync  mark. 

2.  No  more  than  two  consecutive  off  bits  (Os)  appear  in  any  given  10-bit  GCR  byte  or 
combination  of  GCR  bytes.  This  latter  constraint  was  imposed  for  accuracy  when 
clocking  bits  back  into  the  1541  during  a  read.  (See  Chapter  9  for  additional 
information.)
