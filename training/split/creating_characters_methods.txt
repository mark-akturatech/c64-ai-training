# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Methods for creating character shapes: draw on an 8x8 grid and convert pixel patterns to byte values by summing bit-values for each row, or use commercial character editors to generate data interactively. Advises on storing shapes and using tools to ease creation.

                          Your original characters may be created by darkening squares on an 8
                          by 8 grid, converting all darkened squares to their bit values, and
                          then adding the bit values for each of the eight bytes.  Or, you may
                          use one of the many character graphics editor programs that are
                          available commercially to generate the data interactively by drawing
                          on the screen.
