# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Advantages of user-defined characters: extend graphics power (math/foreign symbols, graphics substitutes for bitmap plotting), allow higher apparent resolution with less memory, faster to print than plotting individual points. Encourages creation and use of custom character sets for enhanced display capabilities.

                          As indicated above, you are by no means limited to using the
                          character data furnished by the ROM.  The availability of user-defined
                          characters greatly extends the graphics power of the 64.  It allows
                          you to create special text characters, like math or chemistry symbols
                          and foreign language alphabets.  You can also develop special graphics
                          characters as a substitute for plotting points in bitmap graphics.
                          You can achieve the same resolution using a custom character as in
                          high-resolution bitmap mode, but with less memory. Once you have
                          defined the character, it is much faster to print it to the screen
                          than in would be to plot out all of the individual points.
