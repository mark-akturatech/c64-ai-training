# MACHINE - Exercises: write BASIC+ML to divide a POKEd value by two and return; write a bootstrap (BASIC LOAD then SYS) to call ML from cassette buffer; create boot loaders for sprites or screens; ML routine to change variable names (dangerous).

Questions and Projects
----------------------

Write a simple BASIC and machine language program set that allows BASIC to
input a number less than 256; POKE it somewhere in memory; call machine
language that will divide the number by two; PEEK it back and print it.

A program that brings in other programs is called a "boot," or, more
accurately, a bootstrap program.  Write a simple BASIC boot program to bring
in a previous program exercise that was located in a cassette buffer (say,
the program from Chapter 2 that printed HELLO), and then call it with a SYS.

Bootstrap programs are especially popular with VIC, Commodore 64, and PLUS/4
for bringing in chunks of data such as sprites, new character sets, or whole
display screens of information.  You might like to try your hand at setting
up such a system.

Try your hand at this.  I have a BASIC program that reads

  100 X=5
  110 SYS ...
  120 PRINT A

Write the machine language to be called by the SYS so that it changes the
name of the variable X to A.  Caution:  this may be fun, but it's dangerous
in real programs since you may end up with two variables that have the same
name.
