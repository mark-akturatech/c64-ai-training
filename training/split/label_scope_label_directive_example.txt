# Kick Assembler - Shows using '.label fillbyte = *+1' inside a scoped label (ClearScreen2) so callers can store directly to clearScreen2.fillbyte without adding 1, and gives a full example filling screen memory and returning from subroutine.

In this way, you can access the labels of an executed macro.

9.8. Accessing Local Labels of For / While loops
By placing a label in front of a for or a while loop, a label scope array is created. This way you can access the
inner labels of a loop from the outside or the labels of one loop from another loop:
.for (var i=0; i<20; i++) {
lda #i
sta loop2[i].color+1
}
loop2:
color:

.for (var i=0; i<20; i++) {
