# byRiclianll - Explains the three-parameter memory-read example: selecting buffer #1, doing block-read into that buffer, using a three-parameter memory-read to request a range ($0490-$049F), using a GET# loop to fetch 16 characters, and how inclusion of the third parameter avoids needing an M-R for each byte.

Line  Range  Description 


150  Opens  logical  file  number  2  to  device  8  with  a  secondary 

address  of  2  assigning  buffer  number  1  ($0400  -  $04FF) 
as  a  workspace. 

160  Reads  the  block  from  drive  0,  track  18,  sector  0  into 

channel  2  buffer  area  ($0400  -  $04FF). 

190  Memory-read  command  ($0490  -  $049F). 

200  Begin  loop  to  read  16  characters. 

210  Transfer  a  byte  from  channel  2  buffer  area  to  C64 

memory  over  the  command  channel  (GET#15,). 

Inclusion  of  the  third  memory-read  parameter  means  that  we  no  longer  have  to  issue 
a  memory-read  command  to  fetch  each  byte  like  we  did  in  the  first  sample  program. 
Instead,  we  establish  a  loop  after  the  memory-read  command  to  pull  a  byte  in.  (See  lines

200-280  above.)  The  alternate  format  of  the  three  parameter  memory-read  command 
in  line  190  is: 

PRINT#15, "M-R: "CHR*(144)CHR*(4)CHR*(16)
