# MACHINE - Methods for converting decimal to hexadecimal: standard repeated-division-by-16 algorithm (remainders give hex digits right-to-left), a useful fraction-to-hex table for calculators (fractions .0000 to .9375 mapping to 0..F), worked example converting 4780 to $12AC, and notes on alternative methods/tools and programmer experience.



Decimal to Hexadecimal
----------------------

The most straightforward method to convert from decimal to hexadecimal is to
divide repeatedly by 16; after each division, the remainder is the next
hexadecimal digit, working from right to left.  This method is not too well
suited to small calculators, which usually don't give remainders.  The
following fraction table may offer some help:

  .0000 - 0    .2500 - 4    .5000 - 8    .7500 - C
  .0625 - 1    .3125 - 5    .5625 - 9    .8125 - D
  .1250 - 2    .3750 - 6    .6250 - A    .8750 - E
  .1875 - 3    .4375 - 7    .6875 - B    .9375 - F

If we were to translate 4780 using this method, we would divide by 16, giving
298.75.  The fraction tells us the last digit is C; we now divide 298 by 16,
giving 18.625.  The fraction corresponds to A, making the last two digits AC.
Next we divide 18 by 16, getting 1.125--now the last three digits are 2AC.
We don't need to divide the one by 16, although that would work; we just put
it on the front of the number to get an answer of $12AC.

                                                                          :8:

There are other methods of performing decimal-to-hexadecimal conversions.
You may wish to look them up in a book on number systems.  Alternatively, you
may wish to buy a calculator that does the job electronically.  Some
programmers get so experienced that they can do conversion in their heads; I
call them "hex nuts."  [ groan... ;-) -wf]

Do not get fixed on the idea of numbers.  Memory locations can always be
described as binary numbers, and thus may be converted to decimal or
hexadecimal at will.  But they may not mean anything numeric:  the memory
location may contain an ASCII coded character, an instruction, or any of
several other things.
