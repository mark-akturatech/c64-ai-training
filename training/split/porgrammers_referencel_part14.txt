  54   BASIC LANGUAGE VOCABULARY

  just type as many inputs as you need separated by commas, which prevents
  the double question mark from appearing. If you type more data than the
  INPUT statement requested, the ?EXTRA IGNORED message appears, which
  means that the extra items you typed were not put into any variables.
    Line 120 displays the word PROMPT before the question mark appears. The
  semicolon is required between the prompt and any list of variables.
    The INPUT statement can never be used outside a program. The Commodore
  64 needs space for a buffer for the INPUT variables, the same space that
  is used for commands.


  INPUT#

  TYPE: I/O Statement
  FORMAT: INPUT# <file number> , <variable list>

    Action: This is usually the fastest and easiest way to retrieve data
  stored in a file on disk or tape. The data is in the form of whole vari-
  ables of up to 80 characters in length, as opposed to the one-at-a-time
  method of GET#. First, the file must have been OPENed, then INPUT# can
  fill the variables.
    The INPUT# command assumes a variable is finished when it reads a
  RETURN code (CHR$ (13)), a comma (,), semicolon (;), or colon (:).
  Quote marks can be used to enclose these characters when writing if
  they are needed (see PRINT# statement).
    If the variable type used is numeric, and non-numeric characters are
  received, a BAD DATA error results. INPUT# can read strings up to 80
  characters long, beyond which a STRING TOO LONG error results.
    When used with device #3 (the screen), this statement will read an
  entire logical line and move the cursor down to the next line.

  EXAMPLES of INPUT# Statement:

  10 INPUT#1,A
  20 INPUT#2,A$,B$

  INT

  TYPE: Integer Function
  FORMAT: INT (<numeric>)

    Action: Returns the integer value of the expression. If the expression
  is positive, the fractional part is left off. If the expression is
  negative, any fraction causes the next lower integer to be returned.

  EXAMPLES of INT Function:

    120 PRINT INT(99.4343), INT(-12.34)

     99       -13


  LEFT$

  TYPE: String Function
  FORMAT: LEFT$ (<string>, <integer>)

    Action: Returns a string comprised of the leftmost <integer> char-
  acters of the <string>. The integer argument value must be in the range
  0 to 255. If the integer is greater than the length of the string, the
  entire string will be returned. If an <integer> value of zero is used,
  then a null string (of zero length) is returned.

  EXAMPLES of LEFT$ Function:

    10 A$ = "COMMODORE COMPUTERS"
    20 B$ = LEFT$(A$,9): PRINT B$
    RUN

    COMMODORE

  LEN

  TYPE: Integer Function
  Format: LEN (<string>)

    Action: Returns the number of characters in the string expression.
  Non-printed characters and blanks are counted.

  EXAMPLE of LEN Function:

    CC$ = "COMMODORE COMPUTER": PRINT LEN(CC$)

     18



  LET

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: [LET] <variable> = <expression>

    Action: The LET statement can be used to assign a value to a variable.
  But the word LET is optional and therefore most advanced programmers
  leave LET out because it's always understood and wastes valuable memory.
  The equal sign (=) alone is sufficient when assigning the value of an
  expression to a variable name.

  EXAMPLES of LET Statement:

    10 LET D= 12              (This is the same as D = 12)
    20 LET E$ = "ABC"
    30 F$ = "WORDS"
    40 SUM$= E$ + F$          (SUM$ would equal ABCWORDS)

  LIST

  TYPE: Command
  FORMAT: LIST [[<first-line>]-[<last-line>]]

    Action: The LIST command allows you to look at lines of the BASIC
  program currently in the memory of your Commodore 64. This lets you use
  your computer's powerful screen editor, to edit programs which you've
  LISTed both quickly and easily.
    The LIST system command displays all or part of the program that is
  currently in memory on the default output device. The LIST will normally
  be directed to the screen and the CMD statement can be used to switch
  output to an external device such as a printer or a disk. The LIST com-
  mand can appear in a program, but BASIC always returns to the system
  READY message after a LIST is executed.
    When you bring the program LIST onto the screen, the "scrolling" of
  the display from the bottom of the screen to the top can be slowed by
  holding down the ConTRoL <CTRL> key. LIST is aborted by typing the
  <RUN/STOP> key.
    If no line-numbers are given the entire program is listed. If only the
  first-line number is specified, and followed by a hyphen (-), that line
  and all higher-numbered lines are listed. If only the last line-number is
  specified, and it is preceded by a hyphen, then all lines from the
  beginning of the program through that line are listed. If both numbers
  are specified, the entire range, including the line-numbers LISTed, is
  displayed.

  EXAMPLES of LIST Command:

    LIST            (Lists the program currently in memory.)

    LIST 500        (Lists line 500 only.)

    LIST 150-       (Lists all lines from 150 to the end.)

    LIST -1000      (Lists all lines from the lowest through 1000.)

    LIST 150-1000   (Lists lines 150 through 1000, inclusive.)

    10 PRINT "THIS  IS LINE 10"
    20 LIST                             (LIST used in Program Mode)
    30 PRINT "THIS  IS LINE 30"

  LOAD


  TYPE: Command

  FORMAT: LOAD["<file-name>"][,<device>][,<address>]



    Action: The LOAD statement reads the contents of a program file from
  tape or disk into memory. That way you can use the information LOADed
  or change the information in some way. The device number is optional,
  but when it is left out the computer will automatically default to 1, the
  cassette unit. The disk unit is normally device number 8. The LOAD closes
  all open files and, if it is used in direct mode, it performs a CLR
  (clear) before reading the program. If LOAD is executed from within a
  program, the program is RUN. This means that you can use LOAD to "chain"
  several programs together. None of the variables are cleared during a
  chain operation.
    If you are using file-name pattern matching, the first file which
  matches the pattern is loaded. The asterisk in quotes by itself ("*")
  causes the first file-name in the disk directory to be loaded. if the
  filename used does not exist or if it is not a program file, the BASIC
  error message ?FILE NOT FOUND occurs.
    When LOADing programs from tape, the <file-name> can be left out, and
  the next program file on the tape will be read. The Commodore 64 will
  blank the screen to the border color after the PLAY key is pressed. When
  the program is found, the screen clears to the background color and the
  "FOUND" message is displayed. When the <C=> key, <CTRL> key, <ARROW LEFT>
  key, or <SPACE BAR> is pressed, the file will be loaded. Programs will
  LOAD starting at memory location 2048 unless a secondary <address> of 1
  is used. If you use the secondary address of 1 this will cause the
  program to LOAD to the memory location from which it was saved.

                                  part of memory that it came from)
