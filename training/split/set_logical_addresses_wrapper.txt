# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Wrapper at $FFBA that JMPs to $FE00 to set logical file number (STA $B8), device number (STX $BA) and secondary address (STY $B9). Includes device number table description and usage notes.

                                *** set logical, first and second addresses
                                this routine will set the logical file number, device address, and secondary
                                address, command number, for other KERNAL routines.
                                the logical file number is used by the system as a key to the file table created
                                by the OPEN file routine. Device addresses can range from 0 to 30. The following
                                codes are used by the computer to stand for the following CBM devices:
                                ADDRESS DEVICE
                                ======= ======
                                 0      Keyboard
                                 1      Cassette #1
                                 2      RS-232C device
                                 3      CRT display
                                 4      Serial bus printer
                                 8      CBM Serial bus disk drive
                                device numbers of four or greater automatically refer to devices on the serial
                                bus.
                                a command to the device is sent as a secondary address on the serial bus after
                                the device number is sent during the serial attention handshaking sequence. If
                                no secondary address is to be sent Y should be set to $FF.
.,FFBA 4C 00 FE JMP $FE00       set logical, first and second addresses
