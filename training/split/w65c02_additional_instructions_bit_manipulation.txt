                 Additional Instructions (W65C02)
                 Note: The bit manipulating instructions BBR, BBS, RMB and SMB were
                 "grandfathered" in from the Rockwell R6500/11/12/15 instruction set.
                 They are present on the W65C02S, but are missing in early versions
                 of the W65C02.
                                                     6502 Instruction Set
                 BBR  Branch on Bit Reset***
                      This branch instruction tests a given bit of
                      the accumulator and branches, if this bit is
                      not set. This is an entire family of eight
                      instructions in total, testing one of bits #0
                      to #7, each. Individual mnemonics designate the
                      tested bit, as in BBRn, where n = 0..7.
                      As with all branch instructions, the address
                      mode is relative, taking a signed single-byte
                      offset as operand.
