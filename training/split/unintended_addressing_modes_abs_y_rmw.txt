# NMOS 6510 - Unintended addressing modes: absolute,Y indexed R-M-W sequence for several undocumented opcodes (DCP, ISC, RRA, RLA, SLO, SRE) showing the 7-cycle timing and detailed per-cycle bus operations (PC/opcode fetch, address low/high fetch, read before high-byte correction, two reads of old data and final write). Simulation link provided and note that legal equivalent is Absolute X Indexed R-M-W for certain instructions.
