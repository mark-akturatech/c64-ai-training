NOTE  1:  When  a  number  appears  inside  the  curly  brackets,  it  means  you  repeat  the 
control  character  immediately  to  the  left  of  the  number  that  many  times.  For 
example: 


{DOWN  5}  means  to  press  CRSR/DOWN  five  (5)  times. 

NOTE  2:  All  programs  have  been  listed  in  a  column  40  characters  wide.  Except  where 
special  characters  have  been  spelled  out  between  curly  brackets,  the  lines  are 
listed  exactly  as  they  appear  on  a  Commodore  64  display.  Spaces  must  be  typed 
in  as  listed.  Where  necessary,  count  the  character  columns  to  determine  the 
appropriate  number  of  spaces. 

Happy  hunting  and  pecking!
