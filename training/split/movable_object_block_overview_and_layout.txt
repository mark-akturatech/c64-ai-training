# COMMODORE 64 - Defines the Movable Object Block (MOB): purpose, count (up to 8), memory size (63 bytes each), displayed dot array size (24x21), and the MOB display block layout (byte indexing 00–62). Explains why MOBs are useful for smooth onscreen movement and gaming graphics.

  MOVABLE OBJECT BLOCKS

    The movable object block (MOB) is a special type of character which can
  be displayed at any one position on the screen without the block
  constraints inherent in character and bit map mode. Up to 8 unique MOBs
  can be displayed simultaneously, each defined by 63 bytes in memory which
  are displayed as a 24*21 dot array (shown below). A number of special
  features make MOBs especially suited for video graphics and game
  applications.
