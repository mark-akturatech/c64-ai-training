# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Wrapper at $FFA5 that JMPs to $EE13 to input a byte from the serial bus with full handshaking. TALK must be used first and TKSA used for secondary addresses.

                                *** input byte from serial bus
                                
                                this routine reads a byte of data from the serial bus using full handshaking. the
                                data is returned in the accumulator. before using this routine the TALK routine,
                                $FFB4, must have been called first to command the device on the serial bus to
                                send data on the bus. if the input device needs a secondary command it must be sent
                                by using the TKSA routine, $FF96, before calling this routine.
                                
                                errors are returned in the status word which can be read by calling the READST
                                routine, $FFB7.
