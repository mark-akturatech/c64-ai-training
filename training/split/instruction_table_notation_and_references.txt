# COMMODORE 64 - Notation and symbol key used throughout the instruction tables: register symbols (A, X, Y, M, P, S), transfer arrows, flag change notation (/, +, - , _, /\, V), IMMEDIATE mode indicator (#), and the note describing the 'Ref: XX' references to the MCS6500 Programming Manual sections.

                The following notation applies to this summary:


     A       Accumulator                  EOR     Logical Exclusive Or

     X, Y    Index Registers              fromS   Transfer from Stack

     M       Memory                       toS     Transfer to Stack

     P       Processor Status Register    ->      Transfer to

     S       Stack Pointer                <-      Transfer from

     /       Change                       V       Logical OR

     _       No Change                    PC      Program Counter

     +       Add                          PCH     Program Counter High

     /\      Logical AND                  PCL     Program Counter Low

     -       Subtract                     OPER    OPERAND

                                          #       IMMEDIATE ADDRESSING MODE










  Note: At the top of each table is located in parentheses a reference
        number (Ref: XX) which directs the user to that Section in the
        MCS6500 Microcomputer Family Programming Manual in which the
        instruction is defined and discussed.
