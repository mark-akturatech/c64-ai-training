# COMMODORE 64 - Very short BASIC sprite creation program (page153.prg) demonstrating minimum steps: POKE sprite pointer 2040, fill 63 bytes from 832..894 with 255 to make a solid square, set VIC base v=53248, enable sprite 0 with POKE v+21,1, set sprite color POKE v+39,1, and position with POKE v,24:Poke v+1,100. Explains each line briefly.

  PROGRAMMING SPRITES - ANOTHER LOOK

    For those of you having trouble with graphics, this section has been
  designed as a more elementary tutorial approach to sprites.

  MAKING SPRITES IN BASIC - A SHORT PROGRAM

    There are at least three different BASIC programming techniques which
  let you create graphic images and cartoon animations on the Commodore 64.
  You can use the computer's built-in graphics character set (see Page
  376). You can program your own characters (see Page 108) or... best of
  all... you can use the computer's built-in "sprite graphics. To
  illustrate how easy it is, here's one of the shortest spritemaking
  programs you can write in BASIC:

start tok64 page153.prg
  10 print"{clear}"
  20 poke2040,13
  30 fors=832to832+62:pokes,255:next
  40 v=53248
  50 pokev+21,1
  60 pokev+39,1
  70 pokev,24
  80 pokev+1,100
stop tok64

Additional information can be found by searching:
- "sprite_pointers_and_memory_location_formula" which expands on POKE 2040 sets sprite pointer to block containing sprite data
- "sprite_color_registers_locations_and_usage" which expands on POKE v+39 sets sprite 0 color
