# 6502 Multiplication and Division Algorithms - Source: llx.com - Discusses that even optimized routines are relatively slow (~151 cycles worst-case) and introduces table lookup as the fastest method: precompute multiplication/division results and look up answers. Notes tradeoff between speed and memory: full multiplication table for arbitrary 1-byte operands is too large for 6502 direct access, so algebraic reduction can shrink tables.


But even the fastest of those routines, under the best possible
circumstances (all variables in page 0, no page crossings, and NUM2 = 0),
takes 151 cycles.  If you need to do much better than that, different
techniques must be used.  The best way to get fast multiplication or
division on the 6502 is table lookup - i.e., the programmer precomputes the
answers to the multiplication or division problems and stores them in
a table, and when the program needs to multiply or divide, it looks up the
answer in the table.


Of course this means there's a tradeoff between speed and code size.
Table lookup works best when the numbers to be multiplied or divided
fall in a limited range, otherwise the tables quickly grow to
unmanageable sizes - for example, a multiplication table for
multiplying two arbitrary one-byte numbers requires more memory than the
6502 can directly access.
