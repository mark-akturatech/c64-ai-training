# ********* - DELAY (location 652, $28C): initial delay counter for the time a key must be held before repeating begins. Default 16, counted down every 1/60 second. When it reaches 0, KOUNT is used to schedule first repeat (so total ~22/60 second before first repeat). After first repeat DELAY stays at 0.

652           $28C           DELAY
Counter for Timing the Delay Until the First Key Repeat Begins

This location is used as a delay counter to determine how long a key
must be held down before the entry of that key should be repeated.

The initial value of 16 is counted down every 1/60 second, as long as
the same key remains pressed.  When the value gets to 0, location 651
($28B) is counted down from 6, and the key is repeated when the value
there reaches 0.  Thus a total of 22/60, or approximately 1/3, second
will elapse before the first repeat of a key.  The value here will be
held to 0 after the first repeat, so that subsequent keystroke
repititions occur much more quickly.
