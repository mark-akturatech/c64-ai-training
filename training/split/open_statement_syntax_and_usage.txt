# byRiclianll - OPEN statement for establishing communication to the 1541: SYNTAX: OPEN file#, device, channel; EXAMPLE: OPEN 15,8,15. Explains file# (1-127), device (8 typical), channel (2-15; 15 = command channel). Notes channels 0 & 1 reserved for DOS; 2-14 are data channels. OPEN may be used in immediate mode or in programs.

1.  Establishing  communications  using  an  OPEN  statement. 

In  order  to  establish  a  communication  channel  between  your  computer  and  your  1541 
disk  drive,  you  use  an  OPEN  statement.  An  OPEN  statement  is  a  BASIC  command 
which  looks  like  this: 

SYNTAX:     OPEN  -file#,   device*,   channel # 
EXAMPLE:    OPEN   15,    8,  15 

where 

file#        =  the  logical  file  number  (1-127) 

device*    =  the  device  number  (8  for  a  stock  1541) 

channel*  =  the  channel  number  or  secondary  address  (2-15) 

NOTE:  Channel  numbers  0  &  1  are  reserved  for  use  by  the  DOS. 
Channel  numbers  2-14  are  data  communications  channels. 
Channel  number  15  is  the  command  channel. 

The  OPEN  statement  can  be  used  either  in  immediate  mode  (typed  and  executed  directly 
from  the  keyboard)  or  under  program  control  (embedded  in  a  program). 

In  the  example  above  (OPEN  15,  8,  15)  we  opened  logical  file  number  15  on  the  C64 
to  device  number  8  (the  disk  drive)  through  channel  15  (the  command  channel).
