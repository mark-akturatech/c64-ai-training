# COMMODORE 64 - Nonzero-page memory locations and usage for the RS-232 system interface and FIFO indices. Includes: $0293 M51CTR (pseudo 6551 control register), $0294 M51COR (pseudo 6551 command register), $0295 M51AJB (two bytes following the control/command registers used to contain baud-rate timing info), $0297 RSSTAT (RS-232 status register), $0298 BITNUM (number of bits to send/receive), $0299 BAUDOF (two bytes equal to time of one bit cell based on system clock/baud rate). Also lists FIFO indices: $029B RIDBE (receiver FIFO end index), $029C RIDBS (receiver FIFO start), $029D RODBS (transmitter FIFO start), $029E RODBE (transmitter FIFO end), and $02A1 ENABL (holds current active interrupts in CIA #2 ICR) with notes: bit 4 = waiting for Receiver Edge, bit 1 = receiving data, bit 0 = transmitting data. (Includes trailing page/footer lines.)



  NONZERO-PAGE MEMORY LOCATIONS AND USAGE FOR
  RS-232 SYSTEM INTERFACE


    General RS-232 storage:

    $0293-M51CTR-Pseudo 6551 control register (see Figure 6-1).
    $0294-M51COR-Pseudo 6551 command register (see Figure 6-2) .
    $0295-M51AJB-Two bytes following the control and command registers in
          the file name field. These locations contain the baud rate for
          the start of the bit test during the interface activity, which,
          in turn, is used to calculate baud rate.
    $0297-RSSTAT-The RS-232 status register (see Figure 6-3).
    $0298-BITNUM-The number of bits to be sent/received.
    $0299-BAUDOF-Two bytes that are equal to the time of one bit cell.
          (Based on system clock/baud rate.)

    $029B-RIDBE-The byte index to the end of the receiver FIFO buffer.
    $029C-RIDBS-The byte index to the start of the receiver FIFO buffer.
    $029D-RODBS-The byte index to the start of the transmitter FIFO buffer.
    $029E-RODBE-The byte index to the end of the transmitter FIFO buffer.
    $02A1-ENABL-Holds current active interrupts in the CIA #2 ICR.
          When bit 4 is turned on means that the system is waiting for the
          Receiver Edge. When bit 1 is turned on then the system is
          receiving data. When bit 0 is turned on then the system is
          transmitting data.
