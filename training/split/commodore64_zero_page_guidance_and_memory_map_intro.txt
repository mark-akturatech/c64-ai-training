# MACHINE - Commodore 64 zero-page guidance (available areas $FC-$FF, work areas like $22-$2A, $4E-$53, etc.) and critical zero-page addresses to avoid. Begins the C64 memory map with $0000 chip directional/I/O registers, float/fixed vectors, zero-page pointers for BASIC, and describes SYS register save locations. Shows vectors for IRQ/BRK/NMI and OPEN/CLOSE/IO vectors around $0314-$0331.
