# byRiclianll - Introduction to Direct-Access Programming: motivates direct-access commands (beyond housekeeping commands NEW, SCRATCH, VALIDATE) and lists example utilities one can implement: change disk name/ID, display BAM, display directory, display/edit track&sector, chain through directory, recover scratched files, recover damaged disks, duplicate disks, copy files, catalog a disk library. Explains that direct-access commands allow deeper maintenance and utilities and that basic understanding is necessary to use later routines.

5.1  Introduction  to  Direct-Access  Programming 

In  Chapter  2  you  learned  how  to  use  such  DOS  commands  as  NEW,  SCRATCH,  and 
VALIDATE,  for  diskette  housekeeping.  This  chapter  describes  how  to  use  another  set 
of  DOS  commands  known  as  direct-access  commands.  These  commands  are  not  com- 
monly used  in  typical  programming  applications.  However,  they  allow  you  to  step  beyond 
simple  housekeeping  chores  to  develop  more  powerful  disk  utility  programs  that  do  such 
things  as: 

Change  a  disk  name  or  cosmetic  ID. 

Display  a  block  availability  map  (the  BAM). 

Display  a  directory. 

Display  a  track  and  sector. 

Chain  through  a  directory  entry. 

Edit  a  track  and  sector. 

Recover  an  inadvertently  scratched  file. 

Recover  a  damaged  diskette. 

Duplicate  a  diskette. 

Copy  a  file. 

Catalog  a  disk  library.
