# byRiclianll - Describes the filename field in a directory entry: file names are up to 16 characters padded with shifted-space ($A0) characters. The shifted spaces do not display as part of the name in directory listings. Example: 'HOW TO USE' is stored with $A0 padding.


.  18:  OO  00  00  00  OO 


48  4F  57  HOW 

53  45  AO     TO  USE 
OO  OO  OO   

OO  OD  OO  . ;  


This  file  starts  on  track  17  ($11),  sector  0  ($00). 


Next  we  have  the  file  name. 


OO:    12  04  82   11   OO  48  4F  57  HOW 

**  **  ** 

OB:    20  54  4F  20  55  53  45  AO     TO  USE 

♦»  »♦ 

10:    AO  AO  AO  AO  AO  OO  OO  OO   

18:    OO  OO  OO  OO  OO  OO  OD  OO   


In  this  case  our  file  is  named  "HOW  TO  USE".  Note  that  file  names  are  padded  out 
to  16  characters  with  shifted  spaces  ($A0)  just  like  the  diskette  name.  The  shifted  spaces 
do  not  show  as  part  of  the  file  name,  however,  when  the  directory  is  displayed. 


.   00:    12  04  82  11  00  48  4F  57  HOW 

.    08:    20  54  4F  20  55  53  45  AO     TO  USE 

.    10:    AO  AO  AO  AO  AO  OO  OO  OO
