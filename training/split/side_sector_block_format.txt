# byRiclianll - Detailed layout of a side-sector block used by relative files: bytes 0-1 = forward pointer to next side sector; byte 2 = side sector number (0-5); byte 3 = record length (bytes per record); bytes 4-15 = track/sector list for up to 6 side sectors (4-5 for side sector #0, 6-7 for #1, ..., 14-15 for #5); bytes 16-255 = track/sector list for up to 120 data blocks (each entry two bytes: track then sector; bytes 16-17 = data block #1, 18-19 = #2, ... 254-255 = data block #120).

Diagrammatically,  each  block  (side  sector)  in  the  side  sector  file  looks  like  this:

254-255  Track  and  sector  of  data  block  #120
