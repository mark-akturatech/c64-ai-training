# ********* - CLEAR (CLR): performs CLR operations. Closes all I/O files via the Kernal CLALL routine, removes string variables by copying end-of-memory pointer ($37-$38) to the bottom-of-strings pointer ($33-$34), and resets pointers for nonarray and array variables (copies end-of-program pointer $31-$32 to $2D-$2E and $2F-$30). RESTORE is called to set the DATA pointer to the start, and the stack is cleared. Note: variable storage areas are made unusable but not overwritten.

Perform CLR

The CLR command closes all I/O files with the Kernal CLALL routine
(62255, $F32F).  It eliminates string variables by copying the end of
memory pointer at 55-56 ($37-$38) to the bottom of strings pointer at
51-52 ($33-$34).  It also copies the pointer to the end of BASIC
program text at 49-50 ($31-$31) to the pointer to the start of
nonarray variables at 45-46 ($2D-$2E) and the start of array variables
at 47-48 ($2F-$30).  This makes these variables unusable (although the
contents of these areas are not actually erased).  RESTORE is called
to set the data pointer back to the beginning, and the stack is
cleared.
