# byRiclianll - Beginning of the BASIC program: program REM/title text and user prompts (insert diskette, press return). Waits for CR, prints 'OK', opens command channel 15 to device 8 (OPEN15,8,15), sends the '10' command to query drive status, reads EN*,EM*,ET*,ES* and checks for EN*='00' before proceeding; if nonzero status it prints the error, closes channel 15 and ends.
