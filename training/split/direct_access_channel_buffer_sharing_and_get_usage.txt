# byRiclianll - Notes that two or more direct-access channels cannot share the same buffer (attempting to do so yields NO CHANNEL). Describes that GET# is used after an M-R to fetch data from the selected buffer via the command channel; fetched bytes must be tested for "" and converted to CHR$(0) if necessary.

NOTE:  Two  or  more  direct-access  data  channels  cannot  share  the  same  buffer  area. 
If  you  attempt  to  open  a  direct-access  data  channel  to  a  buffer  already  in  use  a  70,  a 
NO  CHANNEL  error  will  result. 

The  GET#  command  is  used  following  a  memory-read  command  to  retrieve  the  contents 
of  the  buffer  you  selected.  There  is  one  major  difference,  however.  Bytes  are  now  fetched 
over  the  command  channel  not  the  logical  file  number  of  the  "OPEN  file#,  device#, 
channel#,  buffer#"  statement.  Bytes  must  still  be  tested  for  equality  with  the  null  string 
""  and  converted  to  CHR$(0)  if  need  be.
