# COMMODORE 64 - Examples showing how logical operators evaluate in BASIC: IF A=100 AND B=100 THEN, bitwise AND/OR usage like A=96 AND 32, use of NOT (IF NOT X<Y THEN), and how NOT produces two's complement results.


    The logical operators AND, OR and NOT specify a Boolean arithmetic
  operation to be performed on the two operand expressions on either side
  of the operator. In the case of NOT, ONLY the operand on the RIGHT is
  considered. Logical operations (or Boolean arithmetic) aren't performed
  until all arithmetic and relational operations in an expression have been
  completed.

    EXAMPLES:

    IF A=100 AND B=100 THEN 10    (if both A and B have a value
                                   of 100 then the result is true)

    A=96 AND 32: PRINT A          (A = 32)

    IF A=100 OR B=100 THEN 20     (if A or B is 100 then the
                                   result is true)

    A=64 OR 32: PRINT A           (A = 96)

    IF NOT X<Y THEN 30            (if X>=Y the result is true)

    X= NOT 96                     (result is -97 (two's complement))
