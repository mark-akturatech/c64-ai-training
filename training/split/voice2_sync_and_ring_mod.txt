# COMMODORE 64 - Voice 2 control overview (registers $07–$0D): functionally identical to Voice 1 controls except for two features — SYNC (when selected, synchronizes Oscillator 2 with Oscillator 1) and RING MOD (when selected, replaces Oscillator 2's Triangle output with the ring-modulated combination of Oscillators 2 and 1). Includes surrounding spacing and page footer lines for context.



  VOICE 2

    Registers 07-$0D control Voice 2 and are functionally identical to reg-
  isters 00-06 with these exceptions:

    1) When selected, SYNC synchronizes Oscillator 2 with Oscillator 1.
    2) When selected, RING MOD replaces the Triangle output of Oscillator 2
       with the ring modulated combination of Oscillators 2 and 1.
