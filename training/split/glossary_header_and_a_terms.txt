The numbers in parentheses indicate the chapter in which the word or phrase
is first used.

Absolute Address: (5) An address that can indicate any location in memory.
Accumulator: (3) The A register; the register used for arithmetic.
Address Bus: (1) A bus that signals which part of memory is wanted for the
                 next memory operation.
Address mode: (5) The manner in which  an instruction reaches information
                  within memory.
Address: (1) The identity of a specific location within memory.
Algorithm: (1) A method or procedure to perform a computing task.
Arithmetic shift or rotate: (4) A shift or rotate that usually preserves the
                                sign of a number.
Assembler: (2) A program that assembles or changes source code into object
               code.
Assembly: (1) The process of changing source code into object code.
Assembly code: (1) Also called source code.  A program written in a somewhat
                   human-readable form.  Must be translated ("assembled")
                   before use.
