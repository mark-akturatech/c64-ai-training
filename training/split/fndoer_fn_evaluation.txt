# ********* - FNDOER: Evaluate FN expressions (routine at $B3F4). Describes how the FN evaluation works: evaluate the function argument expression (e.g., FN(A+B*C/D)) and then continue parsing using the rest of the text from the function definition statement. Explains that the function's variable descriptor area is used as working space and that the dependent variable is not permanently modified (so calls like FN(X) do not change the caller's X value).

Perform FN

The FN evaluation is done by evaluating the FN argument (for example,
FN(A+B*C/D)) and then getting the rest of the expression from the text
of the function definition statement.  The function variable
descriptor area is used as a work area, and the dependent variable is
not disturbed (so that if the definition used FN(X), the value of X
will not be changed by the function call).
