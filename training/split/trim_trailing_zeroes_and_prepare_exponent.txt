# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Remove trailing zeros from the fractional part and prepare exponent data: walk backwards in the output buffer removing '0' characters until a non-zero or the decimal point is found, restore the last character if the decimal point is reached, place a '+' placeholder, load the exponent count, and test for zero-exponent early exit (which will null-terminate the string and finish).

                                now remove trailing zeroes
