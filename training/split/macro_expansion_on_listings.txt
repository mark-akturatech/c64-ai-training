# Contents - Describes macro expansion on assembler printouts: ability to request expanded macro printouts showing the macro name and generated code with substitutions (often marked with a '+' prefix), the convenience for debugging, and the diminishing need to see expansions once macros are stable.

If you are going to use macros in your program, 
it is useful to have an assembler that lets you specify 
whether or not it should expand the macro before 
it is printed. When a macro is expanded for print, 
the macro name is expanded for print, the macro 
name is printed followed by the code it generates 
with all of the substitutions shown. On the printout, 
all of the instructions of the expanded macro are 
generally preceded by a + symbol. Without a macro 
expansion on the printout, you must constantly refer 
back and forth between a listing of your macro 



library and the section of code where the macro was 
called. This can be quite time consuming and 
prone to error as you expand the macro by hand for 
debugging purposes. But once all of your macros 
have been debugged and you are familiar with them, 
you rarely need to see them expanded on your 
printouts.
