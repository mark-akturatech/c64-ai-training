# The MOS 6567/6569 video controller (VIC-II) and its application in the Commodore 64 - Registers and bit fields that select alternate display window heights and widths: RSEL (bit in $D011) selects 24 vs 25 text lines (192 vs 200 pixels) and gives the corresponding first/last raster lines (RSEL=0: lines 55..246; RSEL=1: lines 51..250). CSEL (bit in $D016) selects 38 vs 40 columns (304 vs 320 pixels) and gives first/last X coordinates (CSEL=0: X 31..334; CSEL=1: X 24..343). Notes on border intrusion when RSEL/CSEL are 0 (upper/lower border extended by 4 pixels; left by 7, right by 9) and that the underlying character matrix remains 40x25.

The height and width of the display window can each be set to two different
values with the bits RSEL and CSEL in the registers $d011 and $d016:

 RSEL|  Display window height   | First line  | Last line
 ----+--------------------------+-------------+----------
   0 | 24 text lines/192 pixels |   55 ($37)  | 246 ($f6)
   1 | 25 text lines/200 pixels |   51 ($33)  | 250 ($fa)

 CSEL|   Display window width   | First X coo. | Last X coo.
 ----+--------------------------+--------------+------------
   0 | 38 characters/304 pixels |   31 ($1f)   |  334 ($14e)
   1 | 40 characters/320 pixels |   24 ($18)   |  343 ($157)

If RSEL=0 the upper and lower border are each extended by 4 pixels into the
display window, if CSEL=0 the left border is extended by 7 pixels and the
right one by 9 pixels. The position of the display window and its
resolution do not change, RSEL/CSEL only switch the starting and ending
position of the border display. The size of the video matrix also stays
constantly at 40�25 characters.
