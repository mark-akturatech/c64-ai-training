# A Minimal C64 Datasette Program Loader - Introduction to the Commodore Datasette recording format: optimized for data safety, compensates for speed variations (wow/flutter) and dropouts; format encodes information in pulse durations rather than raw samples.

Pulse Encoding
--------------

The Commodore Datasette recording format is heavily optimized for data safety
and can compensate for many typical issues of cassette tape, like incorrect
speed, inconsistent speed (wow/flutter), and small as well as longer dropouts.
This makes the format more complex and way less efficient than "Turbo Tape"
or all other custom formats used by commercial games.
