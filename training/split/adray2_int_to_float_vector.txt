# ********* - Zero-page vector ADRAY2 ($05-$06): points to the BASIC routine that converts an integer to floating-point format. Notes its ROM address at the time, availability for machine-language programs interacting with BASIC, and a cross-reference to the USR-vector explanation.

Vector: Routine to Convert a Number from Integer to Floating Point

This vector points to the address of the BASIC routine which converts
an integer to a floating point number.  This routine is currently
located at 45969 ($B391).  BASIC does not appear to reference this
location.  It is available for use by the programmer who needs to make
such a conversion for a machine language program that interacts with
BASIC.  For an explanation of how to use this routine in connection
with the USR command, see the entry for the USR vector at 785 ($311).
