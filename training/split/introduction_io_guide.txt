# COMMODORE 64 - Introduction to I/O: discussion of computers' abilities (calculate, decide, communicate), focusing on communication complexity and formatting of output for human-readable display. Leads into TV output section.

  comma, it moves the cursor right to the start of the next column. If it
  is past the last column of the line, it moves the cursor down to the next
  line. Like the semicolon, if it is the last item on a line the RETURN is
  suppressed.
    The quote marks ("") separate literal text from variables. The first
  quote mark on the line starts the literal area, and the next quote mark
  ends it. By the way, you don't have to have a final quote mark at the
  end of the line.
    The RETURN code (CHR$ code of 13) makes the cursor go to the next
  logical line on the screen. This is not always the very next line. When
  you type past the end of a line, that line is linked to the next line.
  The computer knows that both lines are really one long line. The links
  are held in the line link table (see the memory map for how this is set
  up).
    A logical line can be 1 or 2 screen lines long, depending on what was
  typed or PRINTed.  The logical line the cursor is on determines where the
  <RETURN> key sends it. The logical line at the top of the screen
  determines if the screen scrolls 1 or 2 lines at a time. There are other
  ways to use the TV as an output device. The chapter on graphics describes
  the commands to create objects that move across the screen. The VIC chip
  section tells how the screen and border colors and sizes are changed. And
  the sound chapter tells how the TV speaker creates music and special
  effects.
