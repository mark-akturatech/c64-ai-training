# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - CIA #1 register image mirroring ($DC10-$DCFF): The CIA has 16 internal registers and occupies a 256-byte region where every 16-byte block is a mirror of the base region. For clarity programs should address the base addresses ($DC00-$DC0F) rather than mirrored areas.

$DC10-$DCFF               CIA #1 Register Images

                          Since the CIA chip requires only enough addressing lines to handle 16
                          registers, none of the higher bits are decoded when addressing the
                          256-byte area that has been assigned to it.  The result is that every
                          16-byte area in this 256-byte block is a mirror of every other.  Even
                          so, for the sake of clarity in your programs it is advisable to use
                          the base address of the chip, and not use the higher addresses to
                          communicate with the chip.
