# The MOS 6567/6569 video controller (VIC-II) and its application in the Commodore 64 - Explains sprite memory layout: sprites use 63 bytes (3 bytes per scanline) stored linearly. Sprite data blocks are 64-byte-aligned and movable in 64-byte steps within the VIC's 16KB space. Describes p-access: VIC reads an 8-bit sprite data pointer from the last 8 bytes of the video matrix every raster line; this pointer supplies the upper 8 address bits for sprite data accesses. Introduces MC0-MC7 (6-bit sprite data counters) as the lower 6 address bits and notes that p-accesses occur every raster line allowing mid-display sprite pointer changes.

3.8.1. Memory access and display
--------------------------------

The 63 bytes of sprite data necessary for displaying 24�21 pixels are
stored in memory in a linear fashion: 3 adjacent bytes form one line of the
sprite.

These 63 bytes can be moved in steps of 64 bytes within the 16KB address
space of the VIC. For this, the VIC reads a sprite data pointer for each
sprite in every raster line from the very last 8 bytes of the video matrix
(p-access) that is used as the upper 8 bits of the address for sprite data
accesses (s-accesses). The lower 6 bits come from a sprite data counter
(MC0-MC7, one for each sprite) that plays a similar role for the sprites as
VC does for the video matrix. As the p-accesses are done in every raster
line and not only when the belonging sprite is just displayed, you can
change the appearance of a sprite in the middle of its display by changing
the sprite data pointer.
