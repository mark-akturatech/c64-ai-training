# ********* - Section 1.2: Technical specifications of the 1541 disk drive — storage capacity, file counts, ROM/RAM details, pipeline DOS behavior, compatibility with other Commodore drives, serial bus description, ICs, buffer RAM, physical dimensions, power requirements, and media format.

1.2 SPECIFICATIONS

This disk drive allows you to store up to 144 different programs
and/or data files on a single mini-floppy diskette, for a maximum of
over 174,000 bytes worth of information storage.

Included in the drive is circuitry for both the disk controller and a
complete disk operating system, a total of 16K of ROM and 2K of RAM
memory.  This circuitry makes your Commodore 1541 disk drive an
"intelligent" device.  This means it does its own processing without
taking any memory away from your Commodore 64 or VIC 20 computer.  The
disk uses a "pipeline" software system.  The "pipeline" makes the disk
able to process commands while the computer is performing other jobs.
This dramatically improves the overall throughput (input and output)
of the system.

Diskettes that you create in this disk drive are read and write
compatible with Commodore 4040 and 2031 disk drives.  Therefore,
diskettes can be used interchangeably on any of these systems.  In
addition, this drive can read programs created on the older Commodore
2040 drives.

The 1541 disk drive contains a dual "serial bus" interface.  This bus
was specially created by Commodore.  The signals of this bus resemble
the parallel IEEE-488 interface used on Commodore PET computers,
except that only one wire is used to communicate data instead of eight.
 The two ports at the rear of the drive allows more than one device to
share the serial bus at the same time.  This is accomplished by
"daisy-chaining" the devices together, each plugged into the next. Up
to five disk drives and one printer can share the bus simultaneously.
