# byRiclianll - Description of USR (user) files: designated by file-type byte $83 in the directory. USR is a legal but uncommon file type; DOS may structure a USR file as sequential or program if created by DOS, but arbitrary layouts are possible if created via direct-access. Warning: DOS expects track/sector links in normal places -- if missing the BAM will mark blocks free when validating.

4.8  User  File  Storage 

A  user  file  (USR)  file  is  one  that  is  designed  by  the  user.  This  file  type  is  designated 
by  an  $83  in  the  directory.  Although  a  user  file  is  a  legal  Commodore  file  type  (USR), 
its  use  is  quite  rare.  Using  a  USR  file  rather  than  a  more  common  file  type  is  for 
showmanship  only. 

A  user  file  may  have  the  structure  of  either  a  sequential  file  or  a  program  file  if  it  was 
created  by  the  DOS.  It  may  be  structured  entirely  differently  if  it  was  created  using 
direct-access  techniques  described  in  Chapter  5.  Before  you  do  something  rash,  remember
