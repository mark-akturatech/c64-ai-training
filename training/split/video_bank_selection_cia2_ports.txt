# COMMODORE 64 - VIC-II accesses 16K at a time; four 16K banks exist to cover 64K memory. Bank select bits (bits 0-1 of PORT A of CIA #2 at location 56576 / $DD00) control which bank VIC-II sees. To change bank, set those bits as outputs by setting bits 0-1 of location 56578 / $DD02 to outputs, then write bank bits into 56576. Example POKEs show turning bits to outputs and selecting bank. 'A' value selects bank 0..3.

  VIDEO BANK SELECTION

    The VIC-II chip can access ("see") 16K of memory at a time. Since there
  is 64K of memory in the Commodore 64, you want to be able to have the
  VIC-II chip see all of it. There is a way. There are 4 possible BANKS
  (or sections) of 16K of memory. All that is needed is some means of
  controlling which 16K bank the VIC-II chip looks at. In that way, the
  chip can "see" the entire 64K of memory. The BANK SELECT bits that allow
  you access to all the different sections of memory are located in the
  6526 COMPLEX INTERFACE ADAPTER CHIP #2 (CIA #2). The POKE and PEEK BASIC
  statements (or their machine language versions) are used to select a
  bank, by controlling bits 0 and 1 of PORT A of CIA#2 (location 56576 (or
  $DD00 HEX)). These 2 bits must be set to outputs by setting bits 0 and 1
  of location 56578 ($DD02,HEX) to change banks. The following example
  shows this:

    POKE 56578,PEEK(56578)OR 3: REM MAKE SURE BITS 0 AND 1 ARE OUTPUTS
    POKE 56576,(PEEK(56576)AND 252)OR A: REM CHANGE BANKS

    "A" should have one of the following values:
