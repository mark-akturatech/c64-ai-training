# Sprite Multiplexing Techniques by Cadaver (Lasse Oorni) - Introduction and background: motivation for sprite multiplexing on the C64, games referenced (Green Beret, Ghosts'n Goblins, Midnight Resistance), author's experience reverse-engineering sprite sorting and need for faster sort than simple bubble sort.

This is about displaying more than 8 sprites on the screen (re-using, and thus
"multiplexing" the sprites)


0. Background

Sprite multiplexing in its full extent (as seen in games like Green Beret or
Ghosts'n Goblins, which allow free usage of over 8 sprites anywhere on the
screen, any colors and frames) is a subject seldom discussed in magazines and
such. Often they just discuss re-using the sprites or the "zone split"
technique.

When I started C64 development again, with crossdevelopment, I decided that if
I was going to do a game, it would definitely have to display more than 8
sprites. I tried to search the net for information but basically came up with
nothing, except some programmer diaries, for example Andrew Braybrook's
Morpheus diary, which was referring to some of the issues involved quite
cryptically.

What I had to do was to start reverse-engineering the sprite sorting/
multiplexing routines of games like Green Beret, Midnight Resistance etc.
to understand deeper what was going on. My first sortroutine was of course
the bubblesort but that was slow...
