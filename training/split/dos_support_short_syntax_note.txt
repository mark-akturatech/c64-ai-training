# byRiclianll - Note about the DOS SUPPORT program (from 1541TEST/DEMO): it provides a shorter syntax for sending commands using > or @ keys, automatically handles opening/closing and quoting. This reduced syntax works only in immediate mode, not in programs.

Let's  take  a  look  at  the  disk  commands  used  for  housekeeping.  NOTE:  If  you  are  using 
the  DOS  SUPPORT  program  that  came  on  your  1541TEST/DEMO,  the  syntax  for  these 
disk  commands  is  remarkably  shorter.  The  >  or  @  keys  are  used  to  send  a  command 
to  the  disk  drive.  They  take  the  place  of  the  PRINT#  statement.  In  addition,  you  do 
not  have  to  open  or  close  the  command  channel  or  embed  the  disk  command  in  quota- 
tion marks.  The  DOS  SUPPORT  program  will  do  this  automatically  for  you.  The  DOS 
5.1  syntax  can  be  used  only  in  immediate  mode,  however.  It  cannot  be  used  in  a  pro- 
gram or  a  7SYNTAX  ERROR  will  result.
