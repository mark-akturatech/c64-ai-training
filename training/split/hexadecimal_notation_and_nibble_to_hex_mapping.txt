# Contents - Introduces hexadecimal (hex) as the standard notation used in the book and explains why it is convenient: one hex digit represents 16 values (one nibble), and two hex digits represent any 8-bit value (one byte). Points to Table 3-1 for the correlation between a nibble's 4 bits, its decimal value, and its hex value.

It was mentioned earlier that hexadecimal 
would be the standard notation to be used in this 
book. This is because one hexadecimal (hex) digit 
can represent 16 values or one nibble if it is 
representing a group of 4 bits. Thus it requires 2 
hex digits to represent any 8 bit value or any byte. 
The correlation between the 4 bits of a nibble, its 
decimal value, and its hex value is shown in Table 
3-1.
