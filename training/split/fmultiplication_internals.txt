# ********* - FMULT (multiply FAC1 by FAC2 and store in FAC1), MLTPLY (multiply a byte by repeated addition helper), CONUPK (load FAC2 from a compact 4-byte format), MULDIV (add exponents of FACs), and MLDVEX (handle underflow/overflow). Covers the internal routines used to perform floating-point multiplication and exponent adjustments.

47656         $BA28          FMULT
Multiply FAC1 with FAC2

This routine multiplies the contents of FAC1 by the contents of FAC2
and stores the result in FAC1

47705         $BA59          MLTPLY
Multiply a Byte Subroutine

This subroutine is used to repetitively add a mantissa byte of FAC2 to
FAC1 the number of times specified in the .A register.

47756         $BA8C          CONUPK
Move a Floating Point Number from Memory into FAC2

This subroutine loads FAC2 from the four-byte number (three mantissa
and one sign) pointed to by the .A and .Y registers.

47799         $BAB7          MULDIV
Add Exponent of FAC1 to Exponent of FAC2

47828         $BAD4          MLDVEX
Handle Underflow or Overflow
