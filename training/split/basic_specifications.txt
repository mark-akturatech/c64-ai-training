# Architecture of 6502 Microprocessor - Basic hardware specs: available clock speeds (1, 2, and 3 MHz models), 8-bit word length, and memory-mapped I/O. Explains there are no dedicated I/O registers in the CPU and gives example of writing to address $E000 to reach an I/O device.

Basic Specifications

Clock speed	1, 2 and even 3 Mhz models were available.

Wordlength	8 bits

Input / Output	Memory mapped.

There are no I/O registers in the processor, so a set of memory addresses will be allocated to the I/O devices.  The motherboard hardware will ensure that if a value is written to memory address $E000 (for example), it will be sent straight to a specific output device.
