# ********* - KEYTAB ($F5-$F6) — Vector to the keyboard decode table(s). Explains that KEYTAB points to one of four 64-byte tables which map the 64 keyboard matrix indexes to ASCII values depending on modifier state (unshifted, shifted, Commodore-logo, CTRL). Lists the addresses of the four default tables: 60289 ($EB81) unshifted, 60354 ($EBC2) shifted, 60419 ($EC03) Commodore-logo, 60536 ($EC78) CTRL. Clarifies the distinction between keyboard decode tables (which decide what character each key prints) and character-set tables used by the VIC-II (selected by $D018) which determine how screen codes are rendered.

Vector: Keyboard Decode Table

KEYTAB points to the address of the keyboard matrix lookup table
currently being used.  Although there are only 64 keys on the keyboard
matrix, each key can be used to print up to four different characters,
depending on whether it is struck by itself or in combination with the
SHIFT, CTRL, or Commodore logo keys.

The tables pointed to y this address hold the ASCII value of each of
the 64 keys for one of these possible combinations of keypresses.
When it comes time to print the character, the table that is used
determines which character is printed.

The addresses of the four tables are:

60289 ($EB81) = default uppercase/graphics characters (unshifted)
60354 ($EBC2) = shifted characters
60419 ($EC03) = Commodore logo key characters
60536 ($EC78) = CTRL characters

The concept of the keyboard matrix tables should not be confused with
changing the character sets from uppercase/graphics to
upper/lowercase.  The former involves determining what character is to
be placed into screen memory, while the latter involves determining
which character data table is to be used to decode the screen memory
into individual dots for the display of characters on the screen.
That character base is determined by location 53272 ($D018) of the
VIC-II chip.
