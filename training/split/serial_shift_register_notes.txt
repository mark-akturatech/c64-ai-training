# CIA 6526 Complex Interface Adapter - Comprehensive Reference - Practical notes for the CIA serial (shift) register: synchronous serial port behavior. Output mode (CRA bit 6 = 1): write to SDR ($0C), Timer A provides shift clock, data shifted MSB-first on SP, CNT outputs the shift clock at half Timer A rate; interrupt on byte completion; maximum baud ~PHI2/4 (~250 kbit/s). Input mode (CRA bit 6 = 0): external clock on CNT shifts data in on SP, interrupt after 8 bits, read byte from SDR.

11. SERIAL SHIFT REGISTER NOTES
=============================================================

The 8-bit shift register provides a synchronous serial port.

Output Mode (CRA bit 6 = 1):
  - Write data byte to SDR ($0C)
  - Timer A provides the shift clock
  - Data is shifted out MSB first on SP pin
  - CNT pin outputs the shift clock at half the Timer A rate
  - Interrupt generated when byte is complete
  - Maximum baud rate = PHI2/4 (approximately 250 kbit/s)

Input Mode (CRA bit 6 = 0):
  - External device provides clock on CNT pin
  - Data is shifted in on SP pin
  - Interrupt generated after 8 bits received
  - Read received byte from SDR ($0C)
