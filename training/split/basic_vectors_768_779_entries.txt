# ********* - Entries for BASIC indirect vectors 768-779 ($300-$30B): IERROR (768-769) -> ERROR routine, IMAIN (770-771) -> main BASIC loop, ICRNCH (772-773) -> tokenizing/CRUNCH routine, IQPLOP (774-775) -> listing tokens (QPLOP), IGONE (776-777) -> execute next token (GONE), IEVAL (778-779) -> evaluate single-term arithmetic expression (EVAL). Each entry lists the ROM addresses vectored to and explains the role they play in BASIC input/tokenization/execution.

768-769       $300-$301      IERROR
Vector to the Print BASIC Error Message Routine

This vector points to the address of the ERROR routine at 58251
($E38B).

770-771       $302-$303      IMAIN
Vector to the Main BASIC Program Loop

This vector points to the address of the main BASIC program loop at
42115 ($A483).  This is the routine that is operating when you are in
the direct mode (READY).  It executes statements, or stores them as
program lines.

772-773       $304-$305      ICRNCH
Vector to the Routine That Crunches the ASCII Text of Keywords into
Tokens

This vector points to the address of the CRUNCH routine at 42364
($A57C).

774-775       $306-$307      IQPLOP
Vector to the Routine That Lists BASIC Program Token as ASCII Text

This vector points to the address of the QPLOP routine at 42778
($A71A).

776-777       $308-$309      IGONE
Vector to the Routine That Executes the Next BASIC Program Token

This vector points to the address of the GONE routine at 42980 ($A7E4)
that executes the next program token.

778-779       $30A-$30B      IEVAL
Vector to the Routine That Evaluates a Single-Term Arithmetic
Expression

This vector points to the address of the EVAL routinea t 44678 ($AE86)
which, among other things, is used to evaluate BASIC functions such as
INT and ABS.
