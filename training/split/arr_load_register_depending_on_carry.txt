# NMOS 6510 - Technique to load a register (example uses Y) depending on a comparison result without branches: compare (CMP), execute ARR #$00 to capture the comparison result into the Carry/Accumulator, then TAY to transfer the result into Y. Includes example showing how this replaces a branch and two loads with a shorter sequence.

Example: load register depending on carry

If you need to load a register depending on some branch, you might be able to save some cycles.
Imagine you have the following to load Y depending on the state of the carry:
CMP $1000
BCS +
LDY #$00
BEQ ++

; jump always

+
LDY #$80
++
This can be solved in less cycles and less memory:
CMP $1000
ARR #$00
TAY
