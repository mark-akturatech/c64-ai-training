# ********* - Note about routine split between BASIC ROM and Kernal ROM: routines are split at address $BFFF (49151) and the Kernal begins at $E000 (57344), so a JMP $E000 is appended resulting in BASIC routines in the C64 Kernal being three bytes higher in memory than VIC-20 equivalents. Footer/trailer lines included.

This routine is split between the BASIC ROM wich ends at 49151 ($BFFF)
and the Kernal ROM which begins at 57344 ($E000).  Therefore, a JMP
$E000 instruction is tacked on to the end, which makes the BASIC
routines in the 64 Kernal ROM three bytes higher in memory than the
corresponding VIC-20 routines.
