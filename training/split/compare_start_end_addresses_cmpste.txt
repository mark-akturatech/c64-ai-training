# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL ROM Disassembly (English, "CBM") - CMPSTE: subroutine to compare the start (SAL/SAH) and end (EAL/EAH) addresses used by tape read/save routines. Performs SBC across low/high bytes to set flags for BCC/BNE decisions by callers. Preserves carry (SEC) at entry and returns with RTS.
