# COMMODORE 64 - Insert Mode (part 2) and DEL/INST example: continuation describing the special characters produced by DEL/INST, an example PRINT that produces deletions and insertions (resulting in 'HELP'), boxed WARNING about difficulty editing lines containing DEL/INST characters (they affect LIST output as well), and the condition that insert mode ends on RETURN/SHIFT+RETURN or after typing as many characters as were inserted.



  creates the <T>. And <INST>, which created a special character in quote
  mode, inserts spaces normally.
    Because of this, it is possible to create a PRINT statement containing
  DELetes, which cannot be PRINTed in quote mode. Here is an example
  of how this is done:

    10 PRINT"HELLO"<DEL><INST><INST><DEL><DEL>P"


    When the above line is RUN, the word displayed will be HELP, because
  the last two letters are deleted and the P is put in their place.

  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | WARNING: The DELetes will work when LISTing as well as PRINTing, so   |
  | editing a line with these characters will be difficult.               |
  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+


    The "insert mode" condition is ended when the <RETURN> (or
  <SHIFT+RETURN>) key is hit, or when as many characters have been typed as
  spaces were inserted.
