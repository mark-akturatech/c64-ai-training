# C64 KERNAL API (Lee Davison) - $FFF3 — Return the base address of the I/O devices. Sets X/Y to the address of the memory section where memory-mapped I/O devices are located so software can access device registers using that base plus offsets.

$FFF3          return the base address of the I/O devices
               
               This routine will set XY to the address of the memory section where the memory
               mapped I/O devices are located. This address can then be used with an offset to
               access the memory mapped I/O devices in the computer.
