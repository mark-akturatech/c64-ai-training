# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - Places the cursor at the start of the next logical screen line. Handles linked (double) logical lines by advancing two physical lines when necessary. Uses LXSP ($C9) and TBLX ($D6) pointers, tests for bottom-of-screen and calls the scroll routine when needed. Ends by storing updated TBLX and jumping to set screen pointers.

                                *** GO TO NEXT LINE
                                The cursor is placed at the start of the next logical
                                screen line. This involves moving down two lines for a
                                linked line. If this places the cursor below the bottom of
                                the screen, then the screen is scrolled.
