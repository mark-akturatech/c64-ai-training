# ********* - Track-level performance test and program completion: sets tt, opens a logical file handle (#4) and sends a block-protect (b-p) command to the drive with a pseudo-random target buffer index; constructs a 255-byte buffer (nn$) and writes it to the drive file handle; issues U2 (write track) commands for 'lt' and track 1 (PRINT#1,"u2:" ...), using GOSUB 1840 to display device responses; issues U1 (read track) commands for 'lt' and track 1 (PRINT#1,"u1:" ...), again using GOSUB 1840 for status; closes the handle and prints success messages telling the user to remove the disk and power down; END of the main program.
