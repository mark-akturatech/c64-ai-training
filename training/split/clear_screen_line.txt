# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - Sets the start of the specified screen line then fills it with ASCII spaces ($20). Also clears the corresponding colour RAM line by calling the colour-reset routine (sets colour to COLOR). Includes a free NOP byte after the routine.

                                *** CLEAR SCREEN LINE
                                The start of line is set and the screen line is cleared by
                                filling it with ASCII spaces. The corresponding line of
                                colour RAM is also cleared to the value held in COLOR.
