# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Note about multicolour character graphics: each character can have 3 colours (one from colour RAM per-char, two shared in $D022 and $D023). $D022/$D023 are global for multicolour characters.

Okay, that's all I'm going to say about character graphics right now. You know the basics, now all you have to do is to experiment and think up cool things to do with character graphics.

Note that I haven't mentioned multicolour character graphics. Using multicolour, you can get your characters to have 3 colours each, one of which is set in colour RAM, and two which are set in $d022 and $d023. The colours in colour RAM are of course different for every character, but $d022 and $d023 can't be changed for each character.
