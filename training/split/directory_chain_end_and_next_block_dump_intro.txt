# byRiclianll - States that the next directory sector (track 18, sector 4) ends the directory chain (bytes 0 and 1 contain $00 and $FF), notes only seven entries present in that block and a null entry reserved for expansion. Begins the hex dump of track 18 sector 04.

We  will  end  our  tour  of  the  directory  by  displaying  the  next  sector  (track  18,  sector 
4)  which  happens  to  end  the  directory  chain  ($00,  $FF  in  bytes  0  and  1,  respectively). 
Notice  that  only  seven  directory  entries  are  present  in  this  block.  The  last  directory 
entry  is  a  null  entry.  It  will  be  converted  into  a  valid  entry  when  the  directory  is 
expanded.
