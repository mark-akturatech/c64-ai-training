# MACHINE - Summary of interrupt conditions: /IRQA goes low when (CRA-7=1 and CRA-0=1) OR (CRA-6=1 and CRA-3=1). /IRQB goes low when (CRB-7=1 and CRB-0=1) OR (CRB-6=1 and CRB-3=1). Emphasizes flags link peripheral signals to processor interrupts and interrupt disable bits allow CPU control.

Summary
-------

/IRQA goes low when CRA-7=1 and CRA-0=1 or when CRA-6=1 and CRA-3=1.

/IRQB goes low when CRB-7=1 and CRB-0=1 or when CRB-6=1 and CRB-3=1.

It should be stressed at this point that the flags act as the link between
the peripheral interrupt signal and the processor interrupt inputs.  The
interrupt disable bits allow the processor to control the interrupt function.
