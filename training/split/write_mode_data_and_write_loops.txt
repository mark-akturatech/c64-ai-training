# byRiclianll - Switch to write mode and emit destructive bytes: LDA #$FF to set data direction out, the data/machine-code byte block and textual assembly listing for the destructive write, write loops labeled WRITEL and WRITE2 (CLV, STA to disk output $1C01, DEX/BNE), a JSR to *FE00, LDA #$01, and a JMP to SF969. This section contains the core machine-code bytes and loops that overwrite sync marks on the disk.
