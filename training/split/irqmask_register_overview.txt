# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Definition of $D01A (IRQMASK) register and bit assignments: bit 0 enables raster compare IRQ, bit 1 enables sprite-foreground collision IRQ, bit 2 enables sprite-sprite collision IRQ, bit 3 enables light pen IRQ; bits 4-7 unused. Also includes the register's purpose for enabling VIC-II interrupt conditions.

                     0    Enable Raster Compare IRQ (1=interrupt enabled)
                     1    Enable IRQ to occur when sprite collides with display of
                            normal graphics data (1=interrupt enabled)
                     2    Enable IRQ to occur when two sprites collide (1=interrupt
                            enabled)
                     3    Enable light pen to trigger an IRQ (1=interrupt enabled)
