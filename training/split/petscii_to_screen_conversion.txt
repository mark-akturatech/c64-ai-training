# C64 PETSCII and Screen Codes Reference - sta.c64.org - Conversion rules between PETSCII and C64 Screen Codes (screen memory $0400-$07E7). Gives explicit mapping formulas: PETSCII $20-$3F -> Screen $20-$3F (unchanged); $40-$5F -> Screen $00-$1F (subtract $40); $60-$7F -> Screen $40-$5F (subtract $20); $A0-$BF -> Screen $60-$7F (subtract $40); $C0-$DF -> Screen $40-$5F (subtract $80). Also notes to add $80 to a screen code to get its reverse-video equivalent.

PETSCII TO SCREEN CODE CONVERSION
================================================================================

PETSCII codes and Screen Codes are different numbering systems. The C64
uses PETSCII for I/O operations (PRINT, keyboard input) and Screen Codes
for direct screen memory access ($0400-$07E7).

Conversion formulas:

  PETSCII $20-$3F  -->  Screen Code $20-$3F  (same: space, digits, symbols)
  PETSCII $40-$5F  -->  Screen Code $00-$1F  (subtract $40: @, A-Z, etc.)
  PETSCII $60-$7F  -->  Screen Code $40-$5F  (subtract $20: graphics/letters)
  PETSCII $A0-$BF  -->  Screen Code $60-$7F  (subtract $40: graphic chars)
  PETSCII $C0-$DF  -->  Screen Code $40-$5F  (subtract $80: graphics/letters)

  Add $80 to any screen code for its reverse video equivalent.
