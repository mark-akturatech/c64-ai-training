# Commodore IEC Serial Bus Protocol Reference - pagetable.com - Historical context for Commodore peripheral buses and list of IEEE-488 properties preserved by the Standard Serial (IEC) bus: daisy-chaining, single controller, one-to-many transmission, multi-channel support, byte-stream data, open-collector logic.

Historical Context:
Early personal computers typically connected peripherals through Centronics or
RS-232 interfaces, with disk drives attached directly to internal buses.
Commodore's 1977 PET computer adopted "a standard interface that would allow
to connect several drives and printers to a single port: IEEE-488." This
standardized bus, also known as IEC-625 internationally and "HP-IB," originated
in the late 1960s for test equipment and printers.

The Standard Serial bus (IEC) represents Commodore's serialization of the
IEEE-488 parallel protocol. It maintains key IEEE-488 properties:
  - Daisy-chained device connections
  - Single computer controller managing up to 31 devices
  - One-to-many transmission capability
  - Multi-channel support per device
  - Byte-stream data transmission
  - Open collector logic on all signal lines
