# COMMODORE 64 - Notes on sprite memory allocation, alternative pointer locations (cassette buffer: 832..1023 for blocks 13–15), turning on/off sprites via POKE V+21 and using bitwise operations (PEEK V+21 AND (255-<bit>) to turn off a sprite without affecting others; PEEK(V+21) OR <bit> to re-enable), X position behavior beyond 255 requiring POKE V+16 then new X 0–63, Y position ranges (0–255 with 50–229 visible area), sprite color codes (0–15 mapping to colors), recommendation to reserve separate 64-byte block per sprite (63 bytes used), and advice on pointer placement to avoid overwriting by BASIC program.

  TURNING ON SPRITES:                     +-------------------------------+

    You can turn on any individual sprite by using POKE V+21 and the number
  from the chart... BUT... turning on just ONE sprite will turn OFF any
  others. To turn on TWO OR MORE sprites, ADD TOGETHER the numbers of the
  sprites you want to turn on (Example: POKE V+21, 6 turns on sprites 1 and
  2). Here is a method you can use to turn one sprite off and on without
  affecting any of the others (useful for animation).

  EXAMPLE:

    To turn off just sprite 0 type: POKE V+21,PEEK V+21AND(255-1). Change
  the number 1 in (255-1) to 1,2,4,8,16,32,64, or 128 (for sprites 0-7). To
  re-enable the sprite and not affect the other sprites currently turned
  on, POKE V+21, PEEK(V+21)OR 1 and change the OR 1 to OR 2 (sprite 2), OR
  4 (sprite 3), etc.

  X POSITION VALUES BEYOND 255:

    X positions run from 0 to 255... and then START OVER from 0 to 255. To
  put a sprite beyond X position 255 on the far right side of the screen,
  you must first POKE V+ 16 as shown, THEN POKE a new X valve from 0 to 63,
  which will place the sprite in one of the X positions at the right side
  of the screen. To get back to positions 0-255, POKE V+16,0 and POKE in an
  X value from 0 to 255.

  Y POSITION VALUES:

    Y positions run from 0 to 255, including 0 to 49 off the TOP of the
  viewing area, 50 to 229 IN the,viewing area, and 230 to 255 off the
  BOTTOM of the viewing area.

  SPRITE COLORS:

    To make sprite 0 WHITE, type: POKE V+39,1 (use COLOR POKE SETTING shown
  in chart, and INDIVIDUAL COLOR CODES shown below):

    0-BLACK     4-PURPLE        8-ORANGE        12-MED. GREY
    1-WHITE     5-GREEN         9-BROWN         13-LT. GREEN
    2-RED       6-BLUE          10-LT. RED      14-LT. BLUE
    3-CYAN      7-YELLOW        11-DARK GREY    15-LT. GREY

  MEMORY LOCATION:

    You must "reserve" a separate 64-BYTE BLOCK of numbers in the
  computer's memory for each sprite of which 63 BYTES will be used for
  sprite data. The memory settings shown below are recommended for the
  "sprite pointer" settings in the chart above. Each sprite will be unique
  and you'll have to define it as you wish. To make all sprites exactly the
  same, point the sprites you want to look the same to the same register
  for sprites.

  DIFFERENT SPRITE POINTER SETTINGS:

    These sprite pointer settings are RECOMMENDATIONS ONLY.
    Caution: you can set your sprite pointers anywhere in RAM memory but if
  you set them too "low" in memory a long BASIC program may overwrite your
  sprite data, or vice versa. To protect an especially LONG BASIC PROGRAM
  from overwriting sprite data, you may want to set the sprites at a higher
  area of memory (for example, 2040,192 for sprite 0 at locations 12288 to
  12350... 2041,193 at locations 12352 to 12414 for sprite 1 and so on...
  by adjusting the memory locations from which sprites get their "data,"
  you can define as many as 64 different sprites plus a sizable BASIC
  program. To do this, define several sprite "shapes" in your DATA
  statements and then redefine a particular sprite by changing the
  "pointer" so the sprite you are using is "pointed" at different areas of
  memory containing different sprite picture data. See the "Dancing Mouse"
  to see how this works. If you want two or more sprites to have THE SAME
  SHAPE (you can still change position and color of each sprite), use the
  same sprite pointer and memory location for the sprites you want to match
  (for example, you can point sprites 0 and 1 to the same location by using
  POKE 2040,192 and POKE 2041, 192).
