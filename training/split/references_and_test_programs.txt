# NMOS 6510 - References and sources used to verify the document. Lists test-program collections (VICE test-programs), emulator test suites, test programs by named authors, specific demos and games that use undocumented opcodes (Blackmail FLI, Wizball, Spectipede, Turrican 3), historical opcode lists and wiki pages, forum threads and blog posts used for details, and archived visual6502 pages. Also notes that some example code snippets were borrowed from Codebase64 and other sources.
