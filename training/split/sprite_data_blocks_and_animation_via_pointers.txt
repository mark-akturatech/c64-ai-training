# COMMODORE 64 - Explains LINES 100–109: DATA entries contain the 63-byte definitions for each sprite shape. Describes the sequence: first 63 numbers for sprite shape 1, next 63 for shape 2, then 63 for shape 3. Explains how the program reads these DATA values into memory and then simply points sprite 0 at the appropriate 64-byte blocks to animate by swapping pointers. Suggests experimenting with changing DATA numbers to see shape effects.


  LINES 100-109

    DATA                The sprite shapes are read from the data numbers,
                        in order. First the 63 numbers which comprise
                        sprite shape 1 are read, then the 63 numbers for
                        sprite shape 2, and then sprite shape 3. This data
                        is permanently read into the 3 memory locations and
                        after it is read into these locations, all the
                        program has to do is point sprite 0 at the 3 memory
                        locations and the sprite automatically takes the
                        shape of the data in those locations. We are
                        pointing the sprite at 3 locations one at a time
                        which produces the "animation" effect. If you want
                        to see how these numbers affect each sprite, try
                        changing the first 3 numbers in LINE 100 to 255,
                        255, 255. See the section on defining sprite shapes
                        for more information.
