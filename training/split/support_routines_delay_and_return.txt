# byRiclianll - Support subroutines and utility routines for the BASIC COPY program: REM CLOSE and CLOSE15 handling, error/failure messages and branching back to cleanup, a delay/press-return loop (PRINT prompt, GET loop waiting for CR), and a RETURN to resume the main program. These routines handle user interaction and graceful exit after failures or prompts.
