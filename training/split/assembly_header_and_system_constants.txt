# byRiclianll - Assembly source listing header and constants (lines 1541 BACKUP SOURCE LISTING through basic loader and system constants). Contains the title and BASIC bootstrap lines (e.g., OPEN 2,8,2 and SYS 40960), assembler directives (.OPT P,02), comment describing M-R/M-W routines, origin declaration (*=$C000), RAM location notes (POINT = *00FB pointer to read/write), and system routine addresses used (CHKOUT, CHROUT, CLRCHN, CHKIN, etc.) with explanatory comments.
