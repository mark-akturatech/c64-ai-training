# ********* - Introduces location 1 ($01), the R6510 internal I/O port. Lists the meaning of each bit (Bit 0 LORAM, Bit 1 HIRAM, Bit 2 CHAREN, Bit 3 cassette data out, Bit 4 cassette switch sense, Bit 5 cassette motor control, Bits 6-7 unused). Explains the register's chief function: selecting which ROM/RAM and I/O blocks the CPU addresses, noting the C64's ROMs and I/O chips and that address space must be swapped to fit everything.

Bit 0: LORAM signal.  Selects ROM or RAM at 40960 ($A000).  1=BASIC, 0=RAM
Bit 1: HIRAM signal.  Selects ROM or RAM at 57344 ($E000).  1=Kernal, 0=RAM
Bit 2: CHAREN signal.  Selects character ROM or I/O devices.  1=I/O, 0=ROM
Bit 3: Cassette Data Output line.
Bit 4: Cassette Switch Sense.  Reads 0 if a button is pressed, 1 if not.
Bit 5: Cassette Motor Switch Control.  A 1 turns the motor on, 0 turns it off.
Bits 6-7: Not connected--no function presently defined.

The chief function of this register is to determine which blocks of
RAM and ROM the 6510 microprocessor will address.  The Commodore 64
comes with 64K RAM, even though it normally does not use all of that
RAM at once.  In addition, it has an 8K BASIC Interpreter ROM, an 8K
Operating System Kernal ROM, a 4K Character Generator ROM, a Sound
Interface Device (SID), a 6566 Video Interface Controller (VIC-II),
and two 6526 Complex Interface adapter chips.

To address all of these at once would require 88K, 24K past the
addressing limit of the 6510 microprocessor.  In order to allocate
address space, the I/O Port is used to affect the addressing lines,
and thus determine which segments of RAM and ROM will be addressed at
any one time.
