# NMOS 6510 - Alternative method for updating sprite pointers by swapping the roles of A and X. Contains code showing LDX/LDA setup, SAX and STX interleaving, INX increments, stored pointer results comments, and a note that this approach saves 3 bytes (not cycles).


Alternatively you can swap the roles of A and X, and you get the following:
LDX #$04

;X=%00000100

LDA #$fb

;A=%11111011

SAX screen + $3f8 ;$00
STX screen + $3fc ;$04
INX

;X=%00000101

SAX screen + $3f9 ;$01
STX screen + $3fd ;$05
INX

;X=%00000110

SAX screen + $3fa ;$02
STX screen + $3fe ;$06
INX

;X=%00000111

SAX screen + $3fb ;$03
STX screen + $3ff ;$07
This does not save any cycles, but 3 bytes.
