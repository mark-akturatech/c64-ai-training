# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $D418 (54296) SIGVOL — Global Volume & Filter Select: bits0-3 = output volume (0..15), bits4-6 = select low-pass/band-pass/high-pass filters (can combine), bit7 = disconnect output of voice 3 (1=voice3 off) to use oscillator3 for modulation without audio output.

$D418        SIGVOL       Volume and Filter Select Register

                     0-3  Select output volume (0-15)
                     4    Select low-pass filter, 1=low-pass on
                     5    Select band-pass filter, 1=band-pass on
                     6    Select high-pass filter, 1=high-pass on
                     7    Disconnect output of voice 4, 1=voice 3 off

                          Bits 0-3 control the volume of all outputs.  The possible volume
                          levels range from 0 (no volume) to 15 (maximum volume).  Some level of
                          volume must be set here before any sound can be heard.

                          Bits 4-6 control the selection of the low-pass, band-pass, or
                          high-pass filter.  A 1 in any of these bits turns the corresponding
                          filter on.  These filters can be combined, although only one cutoff
                          frequency can be chosen.  In order for the filter to have any effect,
                          at least one of the voices must be routed through it using the Filter
                          Resonance Control Register at 54295 ($D417).

                          When Bit 7 is set to 1,  it disconnects the output of voice 3.  This
                          allows you to use the output of the oscillator for modulating the
                          frequency of the other voices, or for generating random number,
                          without any undesired audio output.
