# MACHINE - Encouraging note on next steps: many application areas (math, BASIC augmentation, graphics, music, hardware interfaces). Machine language knowledge opens up more advanced texts and deeper understanding of hardware/software interplay.


Where To Go From Here
---------------------

Almost anywhere.  Up to this point, we've been building confidence:  trying
to give you a feel as to how the pieces work.  Now, the real fun--the
creative programming--is up to you.

Users have varying objectives.  You may want to do mathematical operations.
You may want to interact upon BASIC programs--analyzing, searching,
renumbering.  Whatever suits you.  Your interest area may be music, graphics,
or animation.  Machine language will open the door to all of these; its
amazing speed makes spectacular effects possible.  You may plan to go into
hardware and interface new devices to your computer; an understanding of
machine language, and IA chips in particular, will be useful.  The
possibilities are endless.
