# - C64 RAM Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $0328-$0329 ISTOP: vector to Kernal STOP routine (currently at $F6ED / 63213). Explains this routine tests the STOP key; shows how STOP can be disabled by POKE 808,239; to disable both STOP and STOP/RESTORE use POKE 808,234 (but this may break LIST). To restore normal behavior POKE 808,237.

$0328-$0329  ISTOP   Vector to Kernal STOP Routine (Currently at 63213 ($F6ED))
                     
                     This vector points to the address of the routine that tests the STOP
                     key.  The STOP key can be disabled by changing this with a POKE
                     808,239.  This will not disable the STOP/RESTORE combination, however.
                     To disable both STOP and STOP/ RESTORE, POKE 808,234 (POKEing 234 here
                     will cause the LIST command not to function properly).  To bring
                     things back to normal in either case, POKE 808, 237.
