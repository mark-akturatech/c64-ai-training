# MACHINE - Appendix D introduction: 'Superchart' overview for PET character sets (PETSCII). Explains columns: ASCII (PET ASCII characters), Screen (Commodore screen codes as used in screen memory), BASIC (codes used inside BASIC programs), and 6502 opcodes included for convenience. Notes on uppercase/graphics sets, lowercase mapping, and mention of graphical chart availability.

Superchart
----------

The "superchart" shows the PET character sets.  A byte may have any of
several meanings, depending on how it is used.  The chart is constructed to
reflect this.  "ASCII" is PET ASCII; these are the characters as they would
be input or printed.  "Screen" is the Commodore screen codes, as they would
be used in screen memory--POKEing to or PEEKing from the screen would yield
these codes. Notice that the numeric character set is the same for both
screen and PET ASCII.

Within a program, the code changes again.  "BASIC" shows these codes; they
are similar to ASCII in the range $20 to $5F.

Machine language op codes are included for the sake of convenience and
completeness.

[any PETSCII character that can't be represented here will be replaced by a
 tilde (~).  For ASCII and SCREEN columns, the first character displayed is
 for the standard uppercase/graphics character set.  The second character, if
 present, is that character in the lowercase character set.  Characters that
 are prepended with "r" means they appear in reverse video.  A complete
 graphical list of the PETSCII and screen codes are listed at my web page,
