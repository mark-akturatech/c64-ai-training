# Architecture of 6502 Microprocessor - Address bus is 16 bits. The processor can access binary addresses from 0000000000000000 to 1111111111111111, shown as $0000 to $FFFF in hexadecimal.

Addresses

Address bus	16 bits

Addresses in the range 	0000000000000000 	to 	1111111111111111 	binary

or			$0000 			to	$FFFF 			hex

can be accessed by the processor.
