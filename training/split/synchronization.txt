# SID 6581/8580 Sound Interface Device - Programming Guide - Oscillator synchronization forces one voice's accumulator to reset every cycle of the synchronizing voice producing complex harmonics. Hard-wired pairings: Voice1 syncs to Voice3 (bit1 $D404), Voice2 -> Voice1 (bit1 $D40B), Voice3 -> Voice2 (bit1 $D412). Example 'mosquito' effect and sweeping technique described.

8. SYNCHRONIZATION
================================================================================

Oscillator synchronization forces one voice's oscillator to reset its phase
accumulator whenever the synchronizing voice's oscillator completes a cycle.
This creates complex harmonic structures.

Voice pairing (hard-wired):
  Voice 1 syncs with Voice 3 (bit 1 of $D404)
  Voice 2 syncs with Voice 1 (bit 1 of $D40B)
  Voice 3 syncs with Voice 2 (bit 1 of $D412)

The synchronized voice produces a waveform whose fundamental frequency matches
the synchronizing voice, but whose harmonic content is determined by the ratio
of the two frequencies.

Example - Mosquito Sound Effect:
  Set Voice 1 to a high-frequency triangle waveform
  Set Voice 3 to a slightly different high frequency
  Enable SYNC bit on Voice 1 (bit 1 of $D404)
  The result is a complex, buzzing harmonic tone

Sweeping the frequency of the synced voice while keeping the sync source
fixed produces dramatic timbral changes.
