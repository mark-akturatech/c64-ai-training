# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Read the next byte from the tape buffer: bump the tape pointer, if buffer not yet exhausted return the next byte; if end reached, call the tape read initiation routine ($F841), handle read errors, clear the tape buffer index ($A6) and loop until a byte is available. Returns with carry clear on success, set on error.
