# MACHINE - Starts a small project to print the letter 'H' using address $033C (cassette buffer). Introduces immediate addressing symbol (#), example instructions (LDA #$48; JSR $FFD2; BRK) and the use of the monitor for assembling and testing.


A Print Project
---------------

Let's write some code to print the letter H on the screen.  Once again, we'll
use address $033C, the cassette buffer, to hold our program.  Reminder:  be
sure to have your monitor loaded and ready before you start this project.

                                                                         :27:

First, the plan; we lay out the instructions

  LDA #$48

We're using a new symbol (#) to signal a special type of information.  It
goes by a variety of names:  pounds sign, sharp, hash mark, or numbers sign.
A more formal name for the symbol is octothorpe, meaning "eight points."
Whatever you call it, the symbol means "the following information is not an
address, it's a value."  In other words, we don't want the computer to go to
address $48, we want it to load the A register with the value $48, which
represents the ASCII letter H.  This type of information access is called
immediate addressing.  In other words, take information immediately, don't go
to memory for it.

  JSR $FFD2

The previous instruction brought the letter H into the A register; this one
prints it to the screen.  Now all we need to do is quite.  BRK takes us to
the machine language monitor.
