# 6502 Instruction Set - Processor stack description: LIFO, top-down at $0100-$01FF; bytes and words (8-bit bytes, 16-bit words little-endian). Signed values are two's complement. System vectors and addresses: $FFFA/$FFFB NMI vector, $FFFC/$FFFD RESET vector, $FFFE/$FFFF IRQ vector (all 16-bit low-high). Start/reset sequence: 7-cycle start-up, PC read from reset vector at $FFFC then JMP. Notes on initialization and that PC is set by reset vector.

          Signed values are two's complement, sign in bit 7 (most significant bit).
          (%11111111 = $FF = -1, %10000000 = $80 = -128, %01111111 = $7F = +127)
          Signed binary and binary coded decimal (BCD) arithmetic modes.
          System Vectors
          $FFFA, $FFFB ... NMI (Non-Maskable Interrupt) vector, 16-bit (LB, HB)
          $FFFC, $FFFD ... RES (Reset) vector, 16-bit (LB, HB)
          $FFFE, $FFFF ... IRQ (Interrupt Request) vector, 16-bit (LB, HB)
          Start/Reset Operations
          An active-low reset line allows to hold the processor in a known disabled
          state, while the system is initialized. As the reset line goes high, the
          processor performs a start sequence of 7 cycles, at the end of which the
          program counter (PC) is read from the address provided in the 16-bit reset
          vector at $FFFC (LB-HB). Then, at the eighth cycle, the processor transfers
          control by performing a JMP to the provided address.
          Any other initializations are left to the thus executed program. (Notably,
          instructions exist for the initialization and loading of all registers, but
          for the program counter, which is provided by the reset vector at $FFFC.)
                                                                6502 Instruction Set
          Instructions by Type
            Transfer Instructions
            Load, store, interregister transfer
            LDA .... load accumulator
            LDX .... load X
            LDY .... load Y
            STA .... store accumulator
            STX .... store X
            STY .... store Y
            TAX .... transfer accumulator to X
            TAY .... transfer accumulator to Y
            TSX .... transfer stack pointer to X
            TXA .... transfer X to accumulator
            TXS .... transfer X to stack pointer
            TYA .... transfer Y to accumulator
            Stack Instructions
            These instructions transfer the accumulator or status register
            (flags) to and from the stack. The processor stack is a last-in-
            first-out (LIFO) stack of 256 bytes length, implemented at addresses
            $0100 - $01FF. The stack grows down as new values are pushed onto it
            with the current insertion point maintained in the stack pointer
            register.
            (When a byte is pushed onto the stack, it will be stored in the
            address indicated by the value currently in the stack pointer, which
            will be then decremented by 1. Conversely, when a value is pulled
            from the stack, the stack pointer is incremented. The stack pointer
            is accessible by the TSX and TXS instructions.)
            PHA .... push accumulator
            PHP .... push processor status register (with break flag set)
            PLA .... pull accumulator
            PLP .... pull processor status register
            Decrements & Increments
            DEC .... decrement (memory)
            DEX .... decrement X
            DEY .... decrement Y
            INC .... increment (memory)
            INX .... increment X
            INY .... increment Y
            Arithmetic Operations

           ADC .... add with carry (prepare by CLC)
           SBC .... subtract with carry (prepare by SEC)
