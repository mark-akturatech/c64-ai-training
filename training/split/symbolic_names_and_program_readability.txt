# Contents - Describes the assembler feature that allows assigning symbolic names to memory locations, hardware registers and program locations; explains how meaningful names improve readability and contrasts assembled source listings with disassemblies (addresses only).

The most useful feature of an assembler is its 
ability to let you assign names. A name can be given 
to a memory location, hardware registers, or a loca- 
tion within the program. Once names have been 
assigned, it is no longer necessary to remember long 
lists of confusing addresses. You only need to 
remember the names you have assigned to the ad- 
dresses. Since you will normally assign names that 



carry some meaning (at least to you) to the memory 
locations and program segments, the program 
becomes infinitely more readable than if the ad- 
dresses themselves had been used. 

But wait, did that last sentence use "readable" 
when referring to an assembly language program? 
Yes it did. Assembly language programs become il- 
legible to others because it is rare to see a full listing 
of the program with all of its definitions; and, often 
a disassembly of a program is called the original pro- 
gram. (A disassembly has no legitimate names, just 
addresses.)
