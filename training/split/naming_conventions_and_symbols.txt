# NMOS 6510 - Naming conventions and shorthand used in the document: register names (A, X, Y, SP, PC), status flags (NV-BDIZC), notation for immediate values {imm}, effective address {addr}, high byte {H+1}, {CONST} magic constant, and common operator symbols (&, |, ^, +, -, *, /).


X

X-register

Y

Y-register

SP

Stack-pointer

PC

Program Counter

NV-BDIZC Flags in the status-register
{imm}

An immediate value

{addr}

Effective address given in the opcode (including indexing)

{H+1}

High byte of the address given in the opcode, plus 1

{CONST}

'Magic' chip and/or temperature dependent constant value

&

Binary AND

|

Binary OR

^

Binary XOR

+

Integer Addition

-

Integer Subtraction

*

Integer Multiplication (powers of two work like a bitshift)

/

Integer Division (powers of two work like a bitshift)

In the various tables colours GREEN, YELLOW and RED are used in the following way:
GREEN indicates all completely stable opcodes, which can be used without special precautions,
YELLOW marks partially unstable opcodes which need some special care and RED is reserved for
the remaining few which are highly unstable and can only be used with severe restrictions.
