# Multidirectional Scrolling Techniques by Cadaver - Overview of scrolling on the C64: hardware character-scroll requires shifting screen memory and color memory, which is expensive (shifting ~1000 bytes can take > half a frame). Recommends splitting shifts across frames according to max scroll speed and using doublebuffering (two screens) to hide intermediate states.

2. Scrolling

Scrolling on the C64 is not so pleasant because after scrolling one character-
length with the hardware registers, screen memory data (and color memory data
too, possibly) need to be shifted in the direction of the scroll. Shifting 1000
bytes (the whole screen) around takes more than half of the rastertime of a
frame.

(I won't go into any VIC-II trick methods of scrolling, they're usually too
limiting for games, at least for scrolling in all directions)

Anyway, it's not so bad as the screen shifting operation can be split on
multiple frames, based on maximum scrolling speed. (If you scroll with 4
pixels/frame, you can split the shifting on two frames)

Naturally, there must be a way to hide the "unfinished" screen shifting,
because it would look very ugly. Therefore doublebuffering (using 2 screens
and switching between them as needed) has to be used.
