# COMMODORE 64 - Further examples of syntax application, examples of actual statements (OPEN examples), and a table of commonly used symbol names such as <file-num>, <device>, <address>, <drive>, <file-name>, <constant>, <variable>, <string>, <number>, <line-number>, <numeric>.

    Programming examples in this book are shown with blanks separating
  words and operators for the sake of readability. Normally though, BASIC
  doesn't require blanks between words unless leaving them out would give
  you an ambiguous or incorrect syntax.
    Shown below are some examples and descriptions of the symbols used for
  various statement parameters in the following chapters. The list is not
  meant to show every possibility, but to give you a better understanding
  as to how syntax examples are presented.

    SYMBOL        EXAMPLE                 DESCRIPTION
  <file-num>        50              A logical file number
  <device>          4               A hardware device number
  <address>         15              A serial bus secondary
                                    device address number
  <drive>           0               A physical disk drive number
  <file-name>       "TEST.DATA"     The name of a data or program file
  <constant>        "ABCDEFG"       Literal data supplied by
                                    the programmer
  <variable>        X145            Any BASIC data variable name or
                                    constant
  <string>          AB$             Use of a string type variable required
  <number>          12345           Use of a numeric type variable
                                    required
  <line-number>     1000            An actual program line number
