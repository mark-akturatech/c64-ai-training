The VIC-II chip's ability to address memory is independent of the 6510
microprocessor.  It can address only 16K at a time, and any of the
four blocks of 16K can be chosen for video memory.  The system default
is for it to use the first 16K.

All of the video display memory, character dot data, and sprite shapes
must be stored within the chosen 16K block.  Locations 53248-53294
($D000-$D02E) are registers which allow the user to communicate with
the VIC-II chip.  Although for the most part they can be written to
and read like ordinary memory locations, their contents directly
control the video display.  Since many of these locations work in
close conjunction with others, a general overview of some of the
different graphics systems on the 64 is in order.

The most familiar type of graphics display is the ordinary text that
appears when you turn the machine on.  The area of RAM which is
displayed on the screen is determined by the Video Matrix Base Address
Nybble of the VIC-II Memory Control Register (53272, $D018).  The
address of the dot-data which is used to assign a shape to each text
character based on an 8 by 8 matrix of lit or unlit dots is determined
by the other half of the Memory Control Register at 53272 ($D018).
More information on how the data is used to represent the character
shapes may be found at the alternate entry for 49152 ($C000), the
Character Generator ROM.

Text character graphics may employ one of the two sets of text and
graphics characters in the Character Generator ROM, or the user may
substitute a completely different set of graphics or text characters
in RAM.

Normally, the text graphics screen uses a background color which is
common to all text characters, and that value is stored in Background
Color Register 0 (53281, $D021).  The color of the frame around the
screen is determined by the Border Color Register at 53280 ($D020).

The color of each character is determined by one nybble of the Color
RAM which starts at 55296 ($D800).  There are, however, two variations
which alter this scheme somewhat.

The first is called multicolor text mode, and is set by Bit 4 of 53270
($D016).  Instead of each bit selecting either the foreground or the
background color for each dot in the character, bit-pairs are used to
select one of four colors for each double-width dot.  This results in
the horizontal resolution being cut to four dots across per character,
but allows two extra colors to be introduced from Background Color
Registers 1 and 2 (53282-53283, $D022-$D023).

The other text mode is called Extended Background Color Mode.  In this
mode, the foreground color is always selected by the Color RAM.  The
background color depends on the actual screen code of the character.
In this mode, only the first 64 character shapes are available, but
each can have one of four different background colors.

The background color for each character is determined by its screen
code as follows:

1.  If the screen code is from 0-63 (this includes the normal
alphanumerics), the value in Background Color Register 0 (53281,
$D021) will determine the background color, as is usual.

2.  Characters with codes 64-255 will have the same shape as the
corresponding character in the group with codes 0-63.

3.  For characters with codes 64-127 (SHIFTed characters), the
background colors are deterined by the value in Background Color
Register 1 (53282, $D022).

4.  The value in Background Color Register 2 (53283, $D023) is used
for characters with codes 128-191 (reversed alphanumerics).

5.  For characters with codes 192-255, the value in Background Color
Register 3 (53284, $D024) is used to determine the background color.


In place of the normal text mode, a bitmap graphics mode is also
abailable by setting Bit 5 of location 53265 ($D011).  In this mode,
each bit of data determines whether one dot on the screen will be set
to either the background color or foreground color.  Within an 8 by 8
dot area, the foreground and background colors may be individually
selected.

The bitmap area is 320 dots wide and 200 dots high.  The area which
contains the graphics data, the bitmap, is determined by the Character
Dot Data Base Address in the lower nybble of the VIC-II Memory Control
Register (53272, $D018).  The Video Matrix Base Address in the upper
nybble, which normally determines which area of memory will be
displayed, instead determines where the color memory for each 8 by 8
ground of dots will be located.

The Color RAM is not used for high-resolution bitmap graphics.  But
multicolor mode is also available for bitmap graphics, and it uses the
Color RAM to determine the foreground color of each dot.

As with multicolor text mode, the horizontal resolution is but in half
(to 160 dots across), so that in addition to the foreground and
background colors, each dot can be one of two other colors as well.
This mode gets the value for the two extra colors from the two nybbles
of each byte of bitmap color memory, the location of which is
determined by the Video Matrix Base Address.
