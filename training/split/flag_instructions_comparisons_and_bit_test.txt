# 6502 Instruction Set - Flag instructions (CLC, CLD, CLI, CLV, SEC, SED, SEI) and comparison instructions (CMP, CPX, CPY) behavior: comparisons subtract operand from register without changing the register, setting Z, C, N appropriately; explanation of test result tables. BIT instruction explained: performs A AND M -> affects Z; transfers operand bit7 -> N and bit6 -> V without changing A. Use-cases for storing flags in memory and using BIT to test multiple bits.

           BVC .... branch on overflow clear
           BVS .... branch on overflow set
           Jumps & Subroutines
           JSR and RTS affect the stack as the return address is pushed onto or
           pulled from the stack, respectively.
           (JSR will first push the high-byte of the return address [PC+2] onto
           the stack, then the low-byte. The stack will then contain, seen from
           the bottom or from the most recently added byte, [PC+2]-L [PC+2]-H.)
           JMP .... jump
           JSR .... jump subroutine
           RTS .... return from subroutine
           Interrupts
           A hardware interrupt (maskable IRQ and non-maskable NMI), will cause
           the processor to put first the address currently in the program
           counter onto the stack (in HB-LB order), followed by the value of
                                                                6502 Instruction Set
            the status register. (The stack will now contain, seen from the
            bottom or from the most recently added byte, SR PC-L PC-H with the
            stack pointer pointing to the address below the stored contents of
            status register.) Then, the processor will divert its control flow
            to the address provided in the two word-size interrupt vectors at
            $FFFA (IRQ) and $FFFE (NMI).
            A set interrupt disable flag will inhibit the execution of an IRQ,
            but not of a NMI, which will be executed anyways.
            The break instruction (BRK) behaves like a NMI, but will push the
            value of PC+2 onto the stack to be used as the return address. Also,
            as with any software initiated transfer of the status register to
            the stack, the break flag will be found set on the respective value
            pushed onto the stack. Then, control is transferred to the address
            in the NMI-vector at $FFFE.
            In any way, the interrupt disable flag is set to inhibit any further
            IRQ as control is transferred to the interrupt handler specified by
            the respective interrupt vector.
            The RTI instruction restores the status register from the stack and
            behaves otherwise like the JSR instruction. (The break flag is
            always ignored as the status is read from the stack, as it isn't a
            real processor flag anyway.)
            BRK .... break / software interrupt
            RTI .... return from interrupt
            See the section Jump Vectors and Stack Operations below for
            operational details.
            Other
            NOP .... no operation
          6502 Address Modes in Detail
          (This section, especially the diagrams included, is heavily inspired
          by the Acorn Atom manual "Atomic Theory and Practice" by David
          Johnson Davies, Acorn Computers Limited, 2nd ed. 1980, p 118–121.)
            Implied Addressing
            These instructions act directly on one or more registers or flags
            internal to the CPU. Therefor, these instructions are principally
            single-byte instructions, lacking an explicit operand. The operand
            is implied, as it is already provided by the very instruction.
            Instructions targeting exclusively the contents of the accumulator
            may or may not be denoted by using an explicit "A" as the operand,
            depending on the flavor of syntax. (This may be regarded as a
            special address mode of its own, but it is really a special case of
            an implied instruction. It is still a single-byte instruction and no
            operand is provided in machine language.)
