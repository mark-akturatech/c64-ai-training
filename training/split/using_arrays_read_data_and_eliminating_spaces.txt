# COMMODORE 64 - Using READ/DATA and arrays/matrices to pack large amounts of data efficiently; eliminating unnecessary spaces in BASIC for memory savings; using GOSUB routines and TAB/SPC for formatting.

  ELIMINATING SPACES

    One of the easiest ways to reduce the size of your program is to
  eliminate all the spaces. Although we often include spaces in sample

  programs to provide clarity, you actually don't need any spaces in your
  program and will save space if you eliminate them.

  USING GOSUB ROUTINES

  If you use a particular line or instruction over and over, it might be
  wise to GOSUB to the line from several places in your program, rather
  than write the whole line or instruction every time you use it.

  USING TAB AND SPC

    Instead of PRINTing several cursor commands to position a character
  on the screen, it is often more economical to use the TAB and SPC in-
  structions to position words or characters on the screen.
