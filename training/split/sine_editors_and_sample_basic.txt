# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Sine editors and generating tables: produce sine tables for sprite movement and effects; example BASIC program provided to poke a sine table into memory (loop over 2π with SIN(I) * amplitude). Suggests splitting larger values for scrolling bigger logos.

Sine editors etc.
You'll need a sine editor to produce nice sine tables, to use for sprite movements, scrollers, plasmas and what have you. Most of them offer the same features, so just check out a few and you'll get what you want.

Some people don't use sine editors, but write small BASIC programs instead. That gives you more flexibility, of course. Here's a small example from BlackJack:

10 L=256: REM length of table

20 X=10: REM amplitude/2

30 A=1024: REM address

40 FOR I=0 TO 2*$ \pi$ STEP 2*$ \pi$ /L

50 : POKE A,SIN(I)*Y+Y

60 NEXT

He also adds: ``It's pretty easy to add stuff between line 40 and 60 to split a larger value into "X div 8" and "X mod 8" for scrolling big logos or similar things.'' If you want more interesting sine movements, you'll have to change line 50 (the SIN(I) part).
