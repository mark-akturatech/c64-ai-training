Copying this document
I'll try to keep this document as available as possible. For that reason, I'll release it into the public domain. Do what you want with it. Mirror it, copy it, change it, even sell it if you want to (if you can do that and still get a good night's sleep, capitalist bastard). Please feel free to print it and hand out copies to your friends, relatives, pets and random gamer lamers.

I'll make this document available on my home page, which will hopefully be available for a long time at http://user.tninet.se/$ \tilde{ } $ uxm165t/. That might change, though, and if you decide to upload it somewhere else, please tell me about it, so that I can add a URL here.

The document is written in LaTeX, and I'll make it available in source form (.tex file), as DVI, postscript, HTML and ascii text. Please convert it to other formats if you feel like it.

If you want to contribute changes, please change the text in the source and send the whole document to me, or as a patch (use the command diff, which should be available if you're on a Unix system).
