# COMMODORE 64 - CHKOUT: define a previously opened logical file as an output channel. Includes purpose, call address ($FFC9 / 65481), communication register (X), preparatory OPEN, possible error returns (0,3,5,7 via READST), stack/register notes, behavior when used with serial devices (auto-sends LISTEN and secondary address), usage steps (load X with logical file number, JSR CHKOUT), example (LDX #3; JSR CHKOUT), and cautions about when it's not needed (screen is default output).

  B-3. Function Name: CHKOUT

    Purpose: Open a channel for output
    Call address: $FFC9 (hex) 65481 (decimal)
    Communication registers: X
    Preparatory routines: (OPEN)
    Error returns: 0,3,5,7 (See READST)
    Stack requirements: 4+
    Registers affected: A, X

    Description: Any logical file number that has been created by the
  KERNAL routine OPEN can be defined as an output channel. Of course, the
  device you intend opening a channel to must be an output device.
  Otherwise an error will occur, and the routine will be aborted.
    This routine must be called before any data is sent to any output
  device unless you want to use the Commodore 64 screen as your output
  device. If screen output is desired, and there are no other output chan-
  nels already defined, then calls to this routine, and to the OPEN routine
  are not needed.
    When used to open a channel to a device on the serial bus, this routine
  will automatically send the LISTEN address specified by the OPEN routine
  (and a secondary address if there was one).

  How to Use:
  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | REMEMBER: this routine is NOT NEEDED to send data to the screen.      |
  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
    0) Use the KERNAL OPEN routine to specify a logical file number, a
       LISTEN address, and a secondary address (if needed).
    1) Load the X register with the logical file number used in the open
       statement.
    2) Call this routine (by using the JSR instruction).

  EXAMPLE:

    LDX #3        ;DEFINE LOGICAL FILE 3 AS AN OUTPUT CHANNEL
    JSR CHKOUT

    Possible errors are:
    #3: File not open
    #5: Device not present
    #7: Not an output file
