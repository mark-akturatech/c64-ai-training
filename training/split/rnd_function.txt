# COMMODORE 64 - RND(numeric): returns pseudorandom floating number in range 0.0 to 1.0. Behavior depends on sign of numeric argument: positive returns repeatable pseudorandom sequence seeded on power-up; zero reads from hardware 'jiffy' clock; negative re-seeds the generator each call. Examples showing how to scale to integer ranges and simulate dice.

  RND

  TYPE: Floating-Point Function
  FORMAT: RND (<numeric>)

    Action: RND creates a floating-point random from 0.0 to 1.0. The
  computer generates a sequence of random numbers by performing cal-
  culations on a starting number, which in computer jargon is called a
  seed. The RND function is seeded on system power-up. The <numeric>
  argument is a dummy, except for its sign (positive, zero, or negative).
    If the <numeric> argument is positive, the same "pseudorandom"
  sequence of numbers is returned, starting from a given seed value. Dif-
  ferent number sequences will result from different seeds, but any se-
  quence is repeatable by starting from the same seed number. Having a
  known sequence of "random" numbers is useful in testing programs.
    If you choose a <numeric> argument of zero, then RND generates a
  number directly from a free-running hardware clock (the system "jiffy
  clock"). Negative arguments cause the RND function to be re-seeded
  with each function call.


  EXAMPLES of RND Function:

    220 PRINT INT(RND(0)*50)               (Return random integers 0-49)

    100 X=INT(RND(1)*6)+INT(RND(1)*6)+2    (Simulates 2 dice)

    100 X=INT(RND(1)*1000)+1               (Random integers from 1-1000)

    100 X=INT(RND(1)*150)+100              (Random numbers from 100-249)

    100 X=RND(1)*(U-L)+L                   (Random numbers between
                                            upper (U) and lower (L) limits)
