# MACHINE - Introduction to IP = 1 mode (Interrupts Prioritized). Specifies the priority order I4 > I3 > I2 > I1 > I0 and notes that in this mode at most one AIR bit is set at a time. Describes the high-level flow: interrupts are latched into ILR, /IRQ asserted, and the appropriate AIR bit set.

2.  IP = 1  Interrupts Prioritized

In this mode the Interrupt Inputs are prioritized in the following order:

  I4 > I3 > I2 > I1 > I0

In this mode only one bit of the AIR can be set at any one time.  If an
interrupt occurs it is latched into the interrupt latch register, the /IRQ
line is pulled low and the appropriate bit of the AIR is set.  To understand
fully the operation of the priority interrupts it is easiest to consider the
following examples.
