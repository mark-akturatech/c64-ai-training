# The MOS 6567/6569 video controller (VIC-II) and its application in the Commodore 64 - ECM=0, BMM=1, MCM=1 multicolor bitmap mode. Pixels are 2 bits formed by adjacent bits (reduces horizontal resolution to 160x200). c-data encodes colors for '11', '01', '10' combinations. g-access addressing like standard bitmap but g-data interpreted as 4 pixels (2bpp): '00'=bg0 ($D021), '01'=color from c-data bits 4-7, '10'=color from c-data bits 0-3, '11'=color from c-data bits 8-11. '01' treated as background in priority/collision logic.

3.7.3.4. Multicolor bitmap mode (ECM/BMM/MCM=0/1/1)
---------------------------------------------------

Similar to the multicolor text mode, this mode also forms (twice as wide)
pixels by combining two adjacent bits. So the resolution is reduced to
160�200 pixels.

The bit combination "01" is also treated as "background" for the sprite
priority and collision detection, as in multicolor text mode.
