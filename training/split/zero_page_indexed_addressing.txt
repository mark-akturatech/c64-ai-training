# MACHINE - Zero-page indexed addressing (e.g., LDA $E0,X) adds the index to a zero-page base and wraps within page 0. All of zero page can be reached by indexing; allows negative indexing representation (e.g., X=$FF as -1). Mostly uses X for addressing; LDX/STX can use Y in some cases.

                                                                         :78:

The "reach" of absolute, indexed instruction allows it to handle information
in buffers (such as the input buffer, keyboard buffer, cassette buffer);
tables (such as the active file table); and short messages (such as HELLO or
error messages).  It's not big enough, however, to reach all parts of screen
memory, all parts of a BASIC program, or all of RAM.  For that, we'll use
indirect, indexed addressing, which will be described later.


All of Zero Page:  Zero-Page, Indexed
-------------------------------------

Zero-page, indexed addressing seems at first glance to be similar to
absolute, indexed mode.  The address given (this time in zero-page) has the
contents of the selected index added to it.  But there's a difference:  in
this case, the effective address can never leave zero page.

This mode usually uses the X register; only two instructions, LDX and STX,
use the Y register for zero-page, indexed addressing.  In either case, the
index is added to the zero-page address; if the total goes beyond zero page,
the address "wraps around."  As an example, if an instruction is coded LDA
#$E0,X and the X register contains 50 at the time of execution, the effective
address will be $0030.  The total ($E0 + $50 or $130) will be trimmed back to
zero page.

Thus, any zero page address can be indexed to reach any other place in zero
page; the reach of 256 locations represents the whole of zero page.  This
creates a new possibility:  with zero-page, indexed addressing, we can
achieve negative indexing.  For this address mode only, we can index in a
downward direction by using index register values such as $FF for -1, $FE for
-2, and so on.

On Commodore machines, zero page is fairly well occupied.  There is limited
opportunity to use zero-page, indexed addressing.
