# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL ROM Disassembly (English, "CBM") - OPN232 buffer allocation and finalization: after GETTOP returns, checks and sets RIBUF/ROBUF allocation flags (RIBUF+1/ROBUF+1), adjusts top-of-memory pointer for allocation (decrements by 256 when allocating), stores buffer pointer values into variables RIBUF/ROBUF, and stores BAUD start rate into M51AJB/M51AJB+1; returns to higher-level open routine with STATUS set appropriately.

                                ;
                                ; CALC # OF BITS
                                ;
