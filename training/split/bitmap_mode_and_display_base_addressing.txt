# COMMODORE 64 - Bit map mode overview and addressing (BMM = 1): explanation that bitmap mode creates a one-to-one mapping between memory bits and displayed dots for a 320×200 resolution. Describes that the VIDEO MATRIX is still accessed but interpreted as color data and that the VIDEO MATRIX COUNTER is used to fetch dot data from an 8000-byte DISPLAY BASE. Includes the DISPLAY BASE address formation: A13 = CB13, A12-A04 = VC9..VC0, A03-A01 = RC2..RC0 (raster counter), and notes that VCx and RCx behavior formats memory as 8×8 dot blocks.

  BIT MAP MODE

    In bit map mode, the 6566/6567 fetches data from memory in a different
  fashion, so that a one-to-one correspondence exists between each
  displayed dot and a memory bit. The bit map mode provides a screen
  resolution of 320H * 200V individually controlled display dots. Bit map
  mode is selected by setting the BMM bit in register 17 ($11) to a "1".
  The VIDEO MATRIX is still accessed as in character mode, but the video
  matrix data is no longer interpreted as character pointers, but rather as
  color data. The VIDEO MATRIX COUNTER is then also used as an address to
  fetch the dot data for display from the 8000-byte DISPLAY BASE. The
  display base address is formed as follows:


     A13| A12| A11| A10| A09| A08| A07| A06| A05| A04| A03| A02| A01| A00
  ------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+------
    CB13| VC9| VC8| VC7| VC6| VC5| VC4| VC3| VC2| VC1| VC0| RC2| RC1| RC0

  VCx denotes the video matrix counter outputs, RCx denotes the 3-bit
  raster line counter and CB13 is from register 24 ($18). The video matrix
  counter steps through the same 40 locations for eight raster lines, con-
  tinuing to the next 40 locations every eighth line, while the raster
  counter increments once for each horizontal video line (raster line).
  This addressing results in each eight sequential memory locations being
  formatted as an 8*8 dot block on the video display.
