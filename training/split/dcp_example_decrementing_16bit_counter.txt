# NMOS 6510 - Example: using DCP in multi-byte (16-bit) decrement sequences. Shows how DCP saves operations when decrementing low byte and conditionally decrementing high byte, while leaving carry set appropriately.

; value to compare with in A
CMP (zp),Y
; react on N, Z, C
You can use:
LDA #$42
; value to compare with in A
LDY #$00
DCP (zp), y
; react on N, Z, C
which is 7 bytes smaller, 12 cycles faster and you can load A any time before.
