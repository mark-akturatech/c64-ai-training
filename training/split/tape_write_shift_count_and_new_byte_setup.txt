# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Executed when a full bit (two half-cycles) has completed. Shifts the just-written bit out of the tape write byte (LSR $BD), decrements the bit count ($A3) and tests for end-of-byte (BEQ to parity/send-next). If data bits remain it restores registers and exits. When a byte completes, it calls new-byte setup (JSR $FB97), re-enables interrupts (CLI), handles cassette synchronization byte counting ($A5), clears the checksum ($D7 = 0), decrements the sync counter, and adjusts the sync value for the 'load' copy by checking copies ($BE) and ORA #$80, then stores the sync byte into $BD for transmission.

                                the bit cycle phase is complete so shift out the just written bit and test for byte

                                the tape data, the first is loaded and is indicated by the synchronisation bytes
