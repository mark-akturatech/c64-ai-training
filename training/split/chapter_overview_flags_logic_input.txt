# MACHINE - Chapter title and overview listing the topics covered: flags (Z, C, N, V), signed numbers, status register, interrupts, logical operators (AND, ORA, EOR), GETIN and STOP input subroutines.



                                                          Chapter 3

                                                      Flags, Logic,
                                                          and Input


          This chapter discusses:

            o Flags that hold status information

            o Testable flags:  Z, C, N, and V

            o Signed numbers

            o The status register

            o First concepts of interrupt

            o Logical operators:  OR, AND, EOR

            o The GETIN subroutine for input

            o The STOP subroutine


                                                                         :40:
