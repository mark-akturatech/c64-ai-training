# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Noters: small utilities to produce release notes; advice on creating custom notes per release or using a generic noter for small releases.

Noters
Noters are used for writing notes to contacts and notes for releases. Personally I think it's cooler to produce a special note for each release, but for small releases you can always use a standard noter. Which one you choose doesn't really matter, as long as it can display text.
