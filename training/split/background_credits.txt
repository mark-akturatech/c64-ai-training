# Multidirectional Scrolling Techniques by Cadaver - Credits and background: cites C-64 Pelintekijan Opas and personal experiments; notes that the methods are the author's own experience and not necessarily optimal.

0. Background

Some of the knowledge in this rant originally comes from the book "C-64
Pelintekijan Opas" ("C-64 Game Maker's Guide") by Jukka Tapanimaki, author of
Netherworld and others. Also credits shall go to my big brother who did initial
experiments with blockmap-scrolling in the late '80s, and I soon followed.

This rant mainly expresses my own methods and experiences, they're not
necessarily the best or anything but have worked nicely, anyway.
