# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Wait-for-PLAY/RECORD routine used before writes: calls the cassette-sense helper (JSR $F82E); if switch open it displays 'PRESS RECORD & PLAY ON TAPE' and waits (branching back to the play prompt/display routine). Always uses the cassette sense helper and display message flow.

                                *** wait for PLAY/RECORD
