# COMMODORE 64 - Explains LINE 20 which initializes the first 63 bytes of sprite-shape data into memory addresses 12288–12350. Covers the concept of using one sprite (sprite 0) with multiple shapes by switching pointers, the FOR S1=12288 TO 12350 loop, READ Q1, POKE S1,Q1 (equivalent to POKE 12288,30 for the first value), and how NEXT advances S1 and reads the next DATA value until POKE 12350,0.

  LINE 20:

    FORS1=12288         We are going to use ONE SPRITE (sprite 0) in this
    TO 12350            animation, but we are going to use THREE sets of
                        sprite data to define three separate shapes. To
                        get our animation, we will switch the POINTERS
                        for sprite 0 to the three places in memory where
                        we have stored the data which defines our three
                        different shapes. The same sprite will be rede-
                        fined rapidly over and over again as 3 different
                        shapes to produce the dancing mouse animation.
                        You can define dozens of sprite shapes in DATA
                        STATEMENTS, and rotate those shapes through
                        one or more sprites. So you see, you don't have to
                        limit one sprite to one shape or vice-versa. One
                        sprite can have many different shapes, simply by
                        changing the POINTER SETTING FOR THAT SPRITE to
                        different places in memory where the sprite data
                        for different shapes is stored. This line means we
                        have put the DATA for "sprite shape 1" at memory
                        locations 12288 to 12350.

    READ Q1             Reads 63 numbers in order from the DATA state-
                        ments which begin at line 100. Q1 is an arbitrary
                        variable name. It could just as easily be A, Z1 or
                        another numeric variable.

    POKES1,Q1           Pokes the first number from the DATA statements
                        (the first "Q1" is 30) into the first memory
                        location (the first memory location is 12288). This
                        is the same as POKE12288,30.

    NEXT                This tells the computer to look BETWEEN the FOR and
                        NEXT parts of the loop and perform those in-between
                        commands (READQ1 and POKES1,Q1 using the NEXT
                        numbers in order). In other words, the NEXT
                        statement makes the computer READ the NEXT Q1 from
                        the DATA STATEMENTS, which is 0, and also
                        increments S1 by 1 to the next value, which is
                        12289. The result is POKE12289,0... the NEXT
                        command makes the loop keep going back until the
                        last values in the series, which are POKE 12350,0.
