# COMMODORE 64 - Guidance for where to place machine language routines: recommended $C000-$CFFF for routines <4K (not disturbed by BASIC). For larger routines, reserve area at top of memory (default top $9FFF) using MEMTOP or POKE trick to reserve top-of-memory from BASIC. Example POKE sequence provided to reserve $9000-$9FFF region.

  WHERE TO PUT MACHINE LANGUAGE ROUTINES

    The best place for machine language routines on the Commodore 64 is
  from $C000-$CFFF, assuming the routines are smaller than 4K bytes long.
  This section of memory is not disturbed by BASIC.
    If for some reason it's not possible or desirable to put the machine
  language routine at $C000, for instance if the routine is larger than 4K
  bytes, it then becomes necessary to reserve an area at the top of memory
  from BASIC for the routine. The top of memory is normally $9FFF. The top
  of memory can be changed through the KERNAL routine MEMTOP, or by the
  following BASIC statements:

    10 POKE51,L:POKE52,H:POKE55,1:POKE56,H:CLR

  Where H and L are the high and low portions, respectively, of the new
  top of memory. For example, to reserve the area from $9000 to $9FFF for
  machine language, use the following:

    10 POKE5110:POKE52,144:POKE5510:POKE56,144:CLR
