# C64 KERNAL API (Lee Davison) - $FFBD — Set the filename. A = length of filename; X/Y = pointer to filename string (X=low byte). If A=0 (no filename) XY may be any address. Used before OPEN, SAVE, LOAD.

$FFBD          set the filename
               
               This routine is used to set up the file name for the OPEN, SAVE, or LOAD routines.
               The accumulator must be loaded with the length of the file and XY with the pointer
               to file name, X being th low byte. The address can be any valid memory address in
               the system where a string of characters for the file name is stored. If no file
               name desired the accumulator must be set to 0, representing a zero file length,
               in that case  XY may be set to any memory address.
