# The MOS 6567/6569 video controller (VIC-II) and its application in the Commodore 64 - Abbreviated ASCII timing diagram for the 6567R56A variant showing a Bad Line with sprites 5-7 active in this line and sprite 0 active in the next line. Includes cycle numbers, IRQ/BA/AEC traces, VIC access-types (including marked sprite pointer and sprite data accesses 'sss' and 'p'/'s' markers), CPU access markers, and the 'Graph.' and X coordinate projection.
