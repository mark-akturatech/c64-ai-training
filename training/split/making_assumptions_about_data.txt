# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Don't over-generalize: write code assumptions for your specific data to remove unnecessary checks and branches; tailor routines to expected inputs for speed.

Making Assumptions About Data
Don't do the mistake of trying to write nice and general routines. If you think that's the way to go, you probably shouldn't be writing demos. With nice, general routines, you have to take care of special cases and take care of weird data. But it's your code and your data, so your code should know what kinds of data it should expect. Don't make your code more complex than it needs to be. Only take care of the cases that can actually happen.

And of course, if you notice that your data demands a complex routine, think of ways to change the data, so that you can write a faster routine to handle it.
