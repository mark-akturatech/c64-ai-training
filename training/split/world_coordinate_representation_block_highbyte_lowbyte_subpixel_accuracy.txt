# Multidirectional Scrolling Techniques by Cadaver - Two world-coordinate representations: (1) pixel-counting from map top-left as 16-bit values (simple but slow collisions and lacks subpixel accuracy); (2) highbyte = block coordinate, lowbyte = position within block (author's preference). With 4 chars per block = 32 pixels, lowbyte gives 3 bits of subpixel accuracy, makes background collision checking fast since map position is the highbyte. Sprite display and sprite-sprite collision need bit-rotates to remove subpixel bits, which is a minor slowdown.

Therefore, for all serious multidirectional scrolling projects, I recommend
using exclusively a world-coordinate system for all objects in the game world
and checking background collisions the "hard way": by examining the map & block
data (that could probably be optimized to check on the screen when possible,
but I haven't done that...)

How does one represent world coordinates? Metal Warrior 1 & 2 simply measured
pixels from the top-left edge of the game map (as 16bit values). This worked
great, to get the position of sprites on screen a value was subtracted based on
the scrolling position. But honestly, the background collisions were slow and
complicated and there was a complete lack of subpixel accuracy, making all
accelerating movement look rough.

Metal Warrior 3 and BOFH use another way to represent world coordinates: the
highbyte of the coordinate represents position as blocks and the lowbyte of
the coordinate represents position within the block. A block has 4 chars =
32 pixels, so as a bonus we get 3 bits of subpixel accuracy. Now background
collision checking becomes very fast & easy to do, because the map position is
directly the coordinate highbyte.

The downside is that the sprite displaying and sprite-sprite collision
checks need now some bit rotates to get rid of the subpixel accuracy, so they
become a bit slower.
