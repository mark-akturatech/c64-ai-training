# Kick Assembler - Mentions built-in modifiers; specifically lists BasicUpstart with parameter _start which adds a memory block with a basic upstart program pointing to the specified address.

In the memory map, you can now see the zeropage code:

Segments

Memory Map
---------Default-segment:
$0801-$080c Basic
$080e-$0824 Basic End
ZeroPage_Code-segment:
$0010-$0015 ZeroPage_Code

Since the bytes are supplied through an intermediate segment all intermediate parameters can be used. In the
following example, a sid file is placed at an alternative address:
*=$8000 "Music Data"
