  HOW TO USE THIS REFERENCE GUIDE

    Throughout this manual certain conventional notations are used to de-
  scribe the syntax (programming sentence structure) of BASIC commands or
  statements and to show both the required and optional parts of each BASIC
  keyword. The rules to use for interpreting statement syntax are as
  follows:

    1. BASIC keywords are shown in capital letters. They must appear where
       shown in the statement, entered and spelled exactly as shown.
    2. Items shown within quotation marks (" ") indicate variable data
       which you must put in. Both the quotation marks and the data inside
       the quotes must appear where shown in each statement.
    3. Items inside the square brackets ([ ]) indicate an optional state-
       ment parameter. A parameter is a limitation or additional qualifier
       for your statements. If you use an optional parameter you must
       supply the data for that optional parameter. In addition, ellipses
       (...) show that an optional item can be repeated as many times as
       a programming line allows.
    4. If an item in the square brackets ([ ]) is UNDERLINED, that means
       that you MUST use those certain characters in the optional para-
       meters, and they also have to be spelled exactly as shown.
    5. Items inside angle brackets (< >) indicate variable data which you
       provide. While the slash (/) indicates that you must make a choice
       between two mutually exclusive options.

  EXAMPLE OF SYNTAX FORMAT:

    OPEN <file-num>,<device>[,<address>],["<drive>:<filename>][,<mode>]"

  EXAMPLES OF ACTUAL STATEMENTS:

    10 OPEN 2,8,6,"0:STOCK FOLIO,S,W"
    20 OPEN 1,1,2,"CHECKBOOK"
    30 OPEN 3,4

    When you actually apply the syntax conventions in a practical situa-
  tion, the sequence of parameters in your statements might not be exactly
  the same as the sequence shown in syntax examples. The examples are not
  meant to show every possible sequence. They are intended to present all
  required and optional parameters.
