# Commodore IEC Serial Bus Protocol Reference - pagetable.com - End-of-Information (EOI) signalling for IEC: no dedicated wire; EOI implemented as a timing sidechannel. Sender delays placing first bit by ≥200 µs after receivers release DATA to indicate final byte; receivers detect this and acknowledge by pulling DATA for 60 µs before final byte.

End-of-Information (EOI) Signaling:
  Rather than a dedicated wire, EOI uses a timing sidechannel:
    - After receivers signal readiness (DATA released), the sender delays
      placing the first bit by at least 200 microseconds
    - Receivers detect this delay and interpret it as "this is the last byte"
    - Receivers acknowledge by pulling DATA for 60 microseconds
    - Then the final byte is transmitted normally

  This timing-based approach saves a wire but adds complexity.
