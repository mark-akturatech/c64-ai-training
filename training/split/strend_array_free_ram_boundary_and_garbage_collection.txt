# ********* - STREND ($31-$32) pointer to the end of the BASIC array storage area (+1) and the start of free RAM. Explains strings grow downward from the top of memory; STREND is the last allowable address for string storage. Defining new variables moves this pointer upward; if a string allocation would cross this boundary garbage collection is triggered, and if insufficient space remains an OUT OF MEMORY error results. The FRE routine performs garbage collection and returns the difference between the address here (STREND) and the end of string text storage pointed to by FREETOP.

49-50         $31-$32        STREND
Pointer to End of the BASIC Array Storage Area (+1), and the Start of
Free RAM

This location points to the address of the end of BASIC array storage
space and the start of free RAM.  Since string text starts at the top
of memory and builds downwards, this location can also be thought of
as the last possible address of the string storage area.  Defining new
variables pushes this pointer upward, toward the last string text.

If a string for which space is being allocated would cross over this
boundary into the array storage area, garbage collection is performed,
and if there still is not enough room, an OUT OF MEMORY error occurs.
FRE performs garbage collection, and returns the difference between
the addresses pointed to here and the address of the end of string
text storage pointed to by location 51 ($33).

51-52         $33-$34        FREETOP
Pointer to the Bottom of the String Text Storage Area

This pointer marks the current end of the string text area, and the
top of free RAM (strings are built from the top of memory downward).
Additional string texts are added, to the area below the address
pointed to here.  After they are added, this pointer is lowered to
point below the newly added string text.  The garbage collection
routine (which is also called by FRE) readjusts this pointer upward.

While the power-on/reset routines set this pointer to the top of RAM,
the CLR command sets this pointer to the end of BASIC memory, as
indicated in location 55 ($37).  This allows the user to set aside an
area of BASIC memory that will not be disturbed by the program, as
detailed at location 55 ($37).
