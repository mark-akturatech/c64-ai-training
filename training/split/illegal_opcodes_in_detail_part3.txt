# 6502 Instruction Set - Further undocumented instructions: SLO (ASL then ORA), SRE (LSR then EOR), TAS (puts A AND X into SP and stores A AND X AND (H+1) in memory) and USBC (SBC variant), many NOP variants (various opcodes acting as NOP in different addressing modes and byte sizes), and JAM (KIL/HLT) description (freezes CPU requiring reset) with listing of JAM opcodes. Discussion on how illegal opcodes can be understood as combinations of c=1 and c=2 threads (bit patterns) producing combined behavior.

                 SHY (A11, SYA, SAY)
                      Stores Y AND (high-byte of addr. + 1) at addr.

                      crossings may not work (with the high-byte of the value
                      used as the high-byte of the address)
