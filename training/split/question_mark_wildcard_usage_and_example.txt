# byRiclianll - Describes the question-mark wildcard (?) as a mask for characters of no importance. Provides an example to scratch files whose eight-character names end in ".C64" using four question marks ("????.C64"), explains why a trailing *.C64 would not match in that case, and gives sample filenames that would or would not be affected.


The  second  wild  card  is  the  question  mark.  It  is  used  to  mask  out  characters  that  are 
not  of  importance.  Suppose  we  want  to  scratch  a  number  of  files  whose  names  are  all 
eight  characters  long  and  end  in  .C64.  We  could  not  use  .C64*  to  scratch  them  since 
the  match  falls  at  the  end  of  the  file  name.  However,  we  could  use: 

EXAMPLE:    OPEN   15,    8,  15 

PRINT#15,    "SO: ????.C64" 
CLOSE  15 

DOS  5.1:    >S0 :????. C64 

Note  that  we  used  four  question  marks  in  the  above  example.  An  exact  match  of  .C64 
must  occur  on  characters  5  through  8  of  the  file  name.  No  match  —  no  scratch.  If  we 
had  154LC64  and  C100.C64  on  the  disk,  both  would  be  scratched  by  the  previous  com- 
mand. However,  BACKUP.C64  would  not  be  affected.
