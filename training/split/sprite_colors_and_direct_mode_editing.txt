# COMMODORE 64 - Explains LINE 60: setting sprite color registers (V+39 through V+46) with 16 possible colors (0 black to 15 gray); example POKE V+39,1 to make sprite 0 white. Notes that sprite data remains in memory until explicitly changed, allowing immediate/direct-mode editing; demonstrates using DIRECT mode to change color (example: POKE V+39,8 to make the sprite orange) and explains that running the program again restores the original color defined in the program.


    LINE 60 sets the COLOR of sprite 0. There are 16 possible sprite
  colors, numbered from 0 (black) to 15 (grey). Each sprite requires a
  different POKE to set its color, from V+39 to V+46. POKE V+39,1 colors
  sprite 0 white. POKE V+46,15 colors sprite 7 grey. (See the SPRITEMAKING
  CHART for more information.)
    When you create a sprite, as you just did, the sprite will STAY IN
  MEMORY until you POKE it off, redefine it, or turn off your computer.
  This lets you change the color, position and even shape of the sprite in
  DIRECT or IMMEDIATE mode, which is useful for editing purposes. As an
  example, RUN the program above, then type this line in DIRECT mode
  (without a line number) and hit the <RETURN> key:

    POKE V+39,8

    The sprite on the screen is now ORANGE. Try POKEing some other numbers
  from 0 to 15 to see the other sprite colors. Because you did this in

  DIRECT mode, if you RUN your program the sprite will return to its origi-
  nal color (white).
