# COMMODORE 64 - Explains the <file-num> (logical file number) and how it relates OPEN, CLOSE, CMD, GET#, INPUT#, and PRINT# statements to each other and to the filename and device. Specifies range (1–255) and that any number in that range may be assigned. Includes the NOTE advising conventionally to use file numbers below 127 (avoid >128).

    The <file-num> is the logical file number, which relates the OPEN,
  CLOSE, CMD, GET#, INPUT#, and PRINT# statements to each other and
  associates them with the file-name and the piece of equipment being used.
  The logical file number can range from 1 to 255 and you can assign it any
  number you want in that range.


  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | NOTE: File numbers over 128 were really designed for other uses so    |
  | it's good practice to use only numbers below 127 for file numbers.    |
