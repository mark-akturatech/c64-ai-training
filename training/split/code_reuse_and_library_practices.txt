# Contents - Practical guidance on reuse: when you write a specialized routine that may be useful later, incorporate it into your macro or subroutine library so common routines are readily available across projects.

Normally, in the course of working on a game 
you will run into a situation that requires you to 
write a specialized routine to perform a certain func- 
tion. If you think that you will be able to use this 
function at a later time, you should incorporate it 
into either your subroutine or macro library. This 
way, you will quickly have the major routines that 
are common to most programs at your fingertips.
