# Kick Assembler - Section 5.4: .for directive syntax and examples (initialization list; boolean condition; iteration list), using multiple expressions in init/iteration, nested .for loops for table generation and loop unrolling, and example blitter/fill usages.

5.4. The .for directive
With the .for directive you can generate loops as in modern programming languages. The .for directive takes
an init expression list, a boolean expression, and an iteration list separated by a semicolon. The last two arguments
and the body are executed as long as the boolean expression evaluates to true.
// Prints the numbers from 0 to 9
.for(var i=0;i<10;i++) .print "Number " + i
// Make data for a sine wave
.for(var i=0;i<256;i++) .byte round(127.5+127.5*sin(toRadians(360*i/256)))

Since argument 1 and 3 are lists, you can leave them out, or you can write several expressions separated by
comma:
// Print the numbers from 0 to 9
.var i=0
.for (;i<10;) {
.print i
.eval i++
}
// Sum the numbers from 0 to 9 and print the sum at each step
.for(var i=0, var sum=0;i<10;sum=sum+i,i++)
.print “The sum at step “ + I “ is “ + sum
