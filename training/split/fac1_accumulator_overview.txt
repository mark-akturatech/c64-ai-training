# ********* - Floating Point Accumulator #1 (FAC1) overview ($61-$66): explains FAC1's central role in BASIC math operations (converting integers and strings to floats and back), describes the internal floating-point format (normalized mantissa and exponent power-of-two), and notes BASIC conversion/manipulation routines and references to related ROM locations (see entries for locations 3 and 5).

Floating Point Accumulator #1

The Floating Point Accumulator is central to the execution of any
BASIC mathematical operation.  It is used in the conversion of
integers to floating point numbers, strings to floating point numbers,
and vice versa.  The results of most evaluations are stored in this
location.

The internal format of floating point numbers is not particularly easy
to understand (or explain).  Generally speaking, the number is broken
into the normalized mantissa, which represents a number between 1 and
1.99999..., and an exponent value, which represents a power of 2.
Multiplying the mantissa by 2 raised to the value of the exponent
gives you the value of the floating point number.

Fortunately, the BASIC interpreter contains many routines for the
manipulation and conversion of floating point number, and these
routines can be called by the user.  See the entries for locations 3
and 5
