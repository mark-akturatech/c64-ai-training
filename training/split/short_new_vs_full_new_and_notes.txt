# byRiclianll - Explains the 'short' new (omit ID): PRINT#15,"NO:DISK NAME" or PRINT#15,"N:DISK NAME" — only works on previously formatted disks; it erases first directory sector and writes empty BAM (track 18 sectors 0-1) without reformatting entire disk. Advises copying files before doing a 'full' new on disks with read/write errors, and notes short new won't fix physical sector errors.

A  "full"  new  on  a  diskette  takes  roughly  2-3  minutes.  There  is  a  quicker  way  to  erase 
a  diskette  that  has  already  been  used.  This  is  accomplished  by  leaving  off  the  disk  ID. 
For  example: 

SYNTAX:  OPEN   15,    8,  15 

PRINT#15,    "NO: DISK  NAME" 
CLOSE  15 


ALTERNATE:    PRINT#15,    "N:DISK  NAME" 

EXAMPLE:        OPEN  15,   8,  15 

PRINT#15,  "NO: TEST  DISKETTE" 
CLOSE  15 


DOS  5.1:        >NO:DISK  NAME 
.>N:DISK  NAME 


Notice  that  no  comma  or  ID  follows  the  disk  name.  This  command  will  work  only  on 
a  diskette  that  has  previously  been  formatted.  It  is  referred  to  as  a  "short"  new.  A 
"short"  new  simply  erases  the  first  sector  in  the  directory  and  writes  an  empty  BAM 
(block  availability  map)  to  tell  the  DOS  that  we  have  a  fresh  diskette  in  use. 

NOTE:  A  diskette  that  is  plagued  by  read  or  write  errors  does  not  have  to  be  pitched. 
Copy  the  files  to  another  diskette  first.  Then  do  a  "full"  new  on  the  offending  diskette. 
This  will  erase  and  reformat  the  entire  diskette.  A  "short"  new  rewrites  only  sectors 
0  and  1  of  track  18  and  will  not  eliminate  any  read  or  write  errors.  See  Chapter  8  about 
how  to  recover  from  both  a  "short"  new  and  a  "full"  new.
