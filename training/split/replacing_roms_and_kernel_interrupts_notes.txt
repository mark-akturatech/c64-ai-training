# ********* - Discusses advanced uses of swapping ROMs: replacing ROM programs with a custom OS or application loaded into RAM, loading alternate languages, or switching out ROMs to give an application access to more RAM. Warns that switching out the Kernal requires disabling interrupts because interrupt vectors reside in the Kernal. Points to examples of inserting new commands via vectors in RAM BASIC.

For machine language applications, it would be possible to replace the
ROM programs with an entirely different operating system, or an
application that has its own screen editing and I/O functions
included.  Such an application would first have to be loaded from disk
into RAM.  A language other than BASIC could be loaded, and could then
just switch out the BASIC ROM, while still using the OS Kernal.

Or a spreadsheet application that contained its own I/O routines could
switch out all ROMs and have the use of all of RAM that is not
actually needed for the program itself, for data.  It should be
remembered, however, that before switching the Kernal out, it is
necessary to disable interrupts, as the vectors for these interrupts
are contained in the Kernal.
