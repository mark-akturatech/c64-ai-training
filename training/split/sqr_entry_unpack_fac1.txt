# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Entry sequence to perform SQR(): rounds and copies FAC1 to FAC2, loads the pointer to the 0.5 constant, and unpacks the memory (AY) into FAC1. This sets up FAC1 for the square-root/power routines.


                                *** perform SQR()
.,BF71 20 0C BC JSR $BC0C       round and copy FAC1 to FAC2
.,BF74 A9 11    LDA #$11        set 0.5 pointer low address
.,BF76 A0 BF    LDY #$BF        set 0.5 pointer high address
.,BF78 20 A2 BB JSR $BBA2       unpack memory (AY) into FAC1
