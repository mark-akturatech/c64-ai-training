# COMMODORE 64 - CLR: makes available RAM used by variables, arrays, GOSUB addresses, FOR..NEXT loops, user-defined functions and files; BASIC program itself remains. Notes that CLR does not properly close disk/tape files (information lost to computer and drive may still think file is open). Example illustrating variables cleared by CLR.


  EXAMPLES of CLOSE Statement:

    10 CLOSE 1
    20 CLOSE X
    30 CLOSE 9*(1+J)


  CLR

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: CLR

    Action: This statement makes available RAM memory that had been used
  but is no longer needed. Any BASIC program in memory is untouched, but
  all variables, arrays, GOSUB addresses, FOR...NEXT loops, user-defined
  functions, and files are erased from memory, and their space is mode
  available to new variables, etc.

    In the case of files to the disk and cassette tape, they are not
  properly CLOSED by the CLR statement. The information about the files is
  lost to the computer, including any incomplete buffers. The disk drive
  will still think the file is OPEN. See the CLOSE statement for more
  information on this.

  EXAMPLE of CLR Statement:


    10 X=25
    20 CLR
    30 PRINT X

    RUN
    0

    READY
