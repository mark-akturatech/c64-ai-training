# 6502 Multiplication and Division Algorithms - Source: llx.com - How to negate numbers on 6502: to negate a value in A (quickest): EOR #$FF; CLC; ADC #1 (two's complement). To negate memory-held multi-byte numbers, subtract them from zero using SEC/SBC: LDA #0; SEC; SBC NUM; STA NUM; LDA #0; SBC NUM+1; STA NUM+1. Use these methods to make operands positive for unsigned routines.

To make a number positive, first examine its high bit.  If the high
bit is 0, no action is necessary, otherwise the number will have to
negated.  The best way to do this depends on where the number is stored
- if it's in the accumulator, the quickest way is this:


EOR #$FF
        CLC
        ADC #1


If the number to be negated is in a memory location, the quickest way
to negate it is to subtract it from 0.  For example, to negate a
two-byte number:


LDA #0
        SEC
        SBC NUM
        STA NUM
        LDA #0
        SBC NUM+1
        STA NUM+1
