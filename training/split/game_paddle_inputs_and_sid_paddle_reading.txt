# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $D419-$D41A — Game Paddle Inputs: SID A/D reads paddles via analog potentiometers returning 0..255. A switching mechanism selects which controller port is read (set CIA#1 Data Port A bits to 01 or 10). To reliably select and read paddles from BASIC you must manage the keyboard IRQ (POKE 56333,127), read PEEK(54297)/PEEK(54298) for paddles, then restore IRQ. Fire buttons are read at CIA ports (bits 2/3). Examples of BASIC code to test paddle fire buttons and notes on conflicts with keyboard scan and joystick.

$D419-$D41A               Game Paddle Inputs

                          These registers allow you to read the game paddles that plug into
                          joystick Controller Ports 1 and 2.  Each paddle uses a variable
                          resistor (also known as a potentiometer or pot), whose resistance is
                          controlled by turning a knob.  The varying resistance is used to vary
                          the voltage to two pins of the SID chip between 0 and +5 volts.
                          Analog-to-digital (A/D) converters in the chip interpret these voltage
                          levels as binary values and store the values in these registers.
                          These registers return a number from 0 (minimum resistance) to 255
                          (maximum resistance) for each paddle in either of the ports, depending
                          on the position of the paddle knob.

                          Since these registers will read the paddle values for only one
                          controller port, there is a switching mechanism which allows you to
                          select which of the two ports to read.  By writing a bit-pair of 01
                          (bit value of 64) to the last two bits of CIA #1 Data Port A (56320,
                          $DC00), you select the paddles on joystick Controller Port 1.  By
                          writing a bit-pair of 10 (bit value of 128), you select the paddles on
                          Controller Port 2.

                          If you look at the description of Data Port A (56320, $DC00), however,
                          you will notice that it is also used in the keyboard scanning process.
                          By writing to this port, you determine which keyboard column will be
                          read.

                          Since the IRQ interrupt keyboard scan routine and the routine that
                          checks for the STOP key are putting values into this location 60 times
                          per second, you cannot reliable select the pair of paddles you wish to
                          read from BASIC without first turning off the keyboard IRQ.  This can
                          be done with a POKE 56333,127.  You can then read the paddles with the
                          statements A=PEEK(54297) and B=PEEK(54298).  The IRQ can be restored
                          after a paddle read with a POKE 56333,129.  It may, however, be easier
                          and more accurate in the long run to use a machine language paddle
                          read subroutine such as that presented on page 347 of the Commodore 64
                          Programmer's Reference Guide.

                          The paddle fire buttons are read as Bits 2 and 3 of the Data Ports A
                          (56320, $DC00) and B (56321, $DC01).  On Port A, if Bit 2 is set to 0,
                          button 1 is pushed, and if Bit 3 is set to 0, button 2 is pushed.  On
                          Port B, if Bit 2 is set to 0, button 3 is pushed, and if Bit 3 is set
                          to 0, button 4 is pushed.

                          The BASIC statements to test these buttons, therefore, are:

                              PB(1)=(PEEK(56321)AND4)/4
                              PB(2)=(PEEK(56321)AND8)/8
                              PB(3)=(PEEK(56320)AND4)/4
                              PB(4)=(PEEK(56320)AND8)/8

                          If a 0 is returned by the PEEK statement, the button is pushed, and if
                          a 1 is returned, it is not.
