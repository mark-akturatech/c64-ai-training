# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Low-level helpers for IEC serial lines and timing: set serial clock out high, set serial clock out low, set serial data out high, set serial data out low, sample serial data status into the carry, and a 1ms delay loop (saves/restores registers and uses an X loop count). These routines operate by reading/writing VIA 2 DRA.
