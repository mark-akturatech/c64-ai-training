# SID 6581/8580 Sound Interface Device - Programming Guide - Combined waveforms: multiple waveform bits produce a logical AND of waveforms. On 6581 combined waveforms produce unique timbres; on 8580 they are quieter or silent. Common combos: Triangle+Saw ($30), Triangle+Pulse ($50), Saw+Pulse ($60). Avoid combining Noise with others (locks LFSR).

5.5 COMBINED WAVEFORMS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Setting multiple waveform bits produces a logical AND of the waveforms
  - On the 6581: Combined waveforms produce unique timbres, commonly used for
    metallic or bell-like sounds. Triangle + Sawtooth is a popular combination.
  - On the 8580: Combined waveforms are much quieter and may produce silence
    depending on the combination
  - Common combinations:
      Triangle + Sawtooth ($30): Soft, slightly metallic tone (6581)
      Triangle + Pulse ($50):    Mixed character
      Sawtooth + Pulse ($60):    Bright, edgy tone
  - Avoid combining Noise with other waveforms (locks LFSR)
