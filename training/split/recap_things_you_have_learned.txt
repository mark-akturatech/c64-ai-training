# MACHINE - Concise recap of chapter takeaways: role of flags linking instructions, which instructions affect flags, the four testable flags (Z, C, N, V) and their branches, status register contents including B/D/I flags, interrupts preserving state, signed numbers in two's-complement, and logical operator functions (AND/ORA/EOR) for bit manipulation.

Things You Have Learned
-----------------------

- Flags are used to link instructions together.  This might be an activity
  such as load or compare, followed by a test such as branch on a given
  condition.

- Some instructions affect one or more flags, and some do not affect flags.
  Thus, and instruction that sets a flag might not be followed immediately
  with the instruction that tests or uses that flag.

- There are four testable flags:  Z (zero, or equals); C (carry, or greater/
  equal); N (negative, or high bit); and V (signed arithmetic overflow).  The
  flags are checked by means of "branch" instructions such as BEQ (branch
  equal) or BNE (branch not equal).

- Flags are stored in the status register, sometimes called the processor
  status word.  The SR contains the four testable flags, plus three other
  flags:  B (break indicator); D (decimal mode for add/subtract); and I
  (interrupt lockout).  The hexadecimal value in SR can be changed to binary
  and used to determine the exact condition of all flags.

- Usually, the processor is interrupted sixty times a second to do special
  high-priority jobs.  Everything, including the status register flags, is
  carefully preserved so that the main program can continue as though nothing
  had happened.

- A number stored in memory can be considered as signed if we decide to
  handle it that way.  The value of a signed number is held in two's-
  complement form.  The high bit of the number is zero if the number is
  positive, one if the number is negative.  The computer doesn't care.  It
  handles the bits whether the number is considered signed or not, but we
  must write our program keeping in mind the type of number being used.

                                                                         :55:

- There are three logical operator instructions:  AND, ORA, and EOR.  These
  allow us to modify bits selectively within the A register.  AND turns bits
  off; ORA turns bits on; and EOR inverts bits, or flips them over.
