# COMMODORE 64 - Explains LINE 80: POKE2040,P sets the sprite pointer to the base location indicated by P (e.g., 192). Also explains the simple timing loop (FOR T=1 TO 60 : NEXT) used as a delay to control the dancing speed of the mouse sprite; suggests changing the loop count to alter animation speed.



  LINE 80:

    POKE2040,P          Sets the SPRITE POINTER to location 192 (remember
                        P=192 in line 45? Here's where we use the P).

    FORT=1TO60:         A simple time delay loop which sets the speed at
    NEXT                which the mouse dances. (Try a faster or slower
                        speed by increasing/decreasing the number 60.)
