# COMMODORE 64 - Examples of array declarations and element assignments showing string, integer and floating-point arrays and multiple dimensions; subscript rules (integer constants, variables or expressions yielding integers), allowed subscript ranges and BAD SUBSCRIPT error; examples A(5)=0, B(5,6)=0, C(1,2,3)=0.

        MTH$(K%)="JAN"          (string array)
        G2%(X)=5                (integer array)
        CNT%(G2%(X))=CNT%(1)-2  (integer array)
        FP(12*K%)=24.8          (floating-point array)
        SUM(CNT%(1))=FP^K%      (floating-point array)

     A(5)=0     (sets the 5th element in the 1 dimensional
                 array called "A" equal to 0)

     B(5,6)=0   (sets the element in row position 5 and column position 6
                 in the 2 dimensional array called "B" equal to 0)

     C(1,2,3)=0 (sets the element in row position 1, column position 2,
                 and depth position 3 in the 3 dimensional array called
                 "C" equal to 0)
