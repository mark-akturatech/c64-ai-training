# NMOS 6510 - Introduction to SRE (aka LSE) undocumented opcode: a combination instruction that performs LSR on memory then EOR with the accumulator. Shows type (LSR + EOR), example opcode bytes ($47, $57 shown), mnemonic forms (SRE zp, SRE zp,X etc), the memory effect ({addr} = {addr} / 2) and the accumulator effect (A = A eor {addr}) along with size/cycle columns as presented in the listing.

EOR)
Opc.
