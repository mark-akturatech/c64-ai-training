  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | NOTE: The Commodore 64 uses the timeout feature to communicate that a |
  | disk file is not found on an attempt to OPEN a file only with an IEEE |
  | card.                                                                 |
  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

  How to Use:

  TO SET THE TIMEOUT FLAG
    1) Set bit 7 of the accumulator to 0.
    2) Call this routine.

  TO RESET THE TIMEOUT FLAG
    1) Set bit 7 of the accumulator to 1.
    2) Call this routine.

  EXAMPLE:

    ;DISABLE TIMEOUT
    LDA #0
    JSR SETTMO

  B-33. Function Name: STOP

    Purpose: Check if <STOP> key is pressed
    Call address: $FFE1 (hex) 65505 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns: None
    Stack requirements: None
    Registers affected: A, X

    Description: If the <STOP> key on the keyboard was pressed during a
  UDTIM call, this call returns the Z flag set. In addition, the channels
  will be reset to default values. All other flags remain unchanged. If the
  <STOP> key is not pressed then the accumulator will contain a byte
  representing the lost row of the keyboard scan. The user can also check
  for certain other keys this way.

  How to Use:
    0) UDTIM should be called before this routine.
    1) Call this routine.
    2) Test for the zero flag.

  EXAMPLE:

    JSR UDTIM   ;SCAN FOR STOP
    JSR STOP
    BNE *+5     ;KEY NOT DOWN
    JMP READY   ;=... STOP

  B-34. Function Name: TALK

    Purpose: Command a device on the serial bus to TALK
    Call address: $FFB4 (hex) 65460 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns: See READST
    Stack requirements: 8
    Registers affected: A

    Description: To use this routine the accumulator must first be loaded
  with a device number between 0 and 31. When called, this routine then
  ORs bit by bit to convert this device number to a talk address. Then this
  data is transmitted as a command on the serial bus.

  How to Use:

    1) Load the accumulator with the device number.
    2) Call this routine.

  EXAMPLE:

    ;COMMAND DEVICE #4 TO TALK
    LDA #4
    JSR TALK

  B-35. Function Name: TKSA

    Purpose: Send a secondary address to a device commanded to TALK
    Call address: $FF96 (hex) 65430 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A
    Preparatory routines: TALK
    Error returns: See READST
    Stack requirements: 8
    Registers affected: A

  302   BASIC TO MACHINE LANGUAGE
~


    Description: This routine transmits a secondary address on the serial
  bus for a TALK device. This routine must be called with a number between
  0 and 31 in the accumulator. The routine sends this number as a secondary
  address command over the serial bus. This routine can only be called
  after a call to the TALK routine. It will not work after a LISTEN.

  How to Use:

    0) Use the TALK routine.
    1) Load the accumulator with the secondary address.
    2) Call this routine.

  EXAMPLE:

    ;TELL DEVICE #4 TO TALK WITH COMMAND #7
    LDA #4
    JSR TALK
    LDA #7
    JSR TALKSA


  B-36. Function Name: UDTIM

    Purpose: Update the system clock
    Call address: $FFEA (hex) 65514 (decimal)
    Communication registers: None
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns: None
    Stack requirements: 2
    Registers affected: A, X

    Description: This routine updates the system clock. Normally this
  routine is called by the normal KERNAL interrupt routine every 1/60th of
  a second. If the user program processes its own interrupts this routine
  must be called to update the time. In addition, the <STOP> key routine
  must be called, if the <STOP> key is to remain functional.

  How to Use:
    1) Call this routine.

  EXAMPLE:

    JSR UDTIM
                                            BASIC TO MACHINE LANGUAGE   303

  B-37. Function Name: UNLSN

    Purpose: Send an UNLISTEN command
    Call address: $FFAE (hex) 65454 (decimal)
    Communication registers: None
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns: See READST
    Stack requirements: 8
    Registers affected: A

    Description: This routine commands all devices on the serial bus to
  stop receiving data from the Commodore 64 (i.e., UNLISTEN). Calling this
  routine results in an UNLISTEN command being transmitted on the serial
  bus. Only devices previously commanded to listen are affected. This
  routine is normally used after the Commodore 64 is finished sending data
  to external devices. Sending the UNLISTEN commands the listening devices
  to get off the serial bus so it can be used for other purposes.

  How to Use:
    1) Call this routine.

  EXAMPLE:
    JSR UNLSN

  B-38. Function Name: UNTLK

    Purpose: Send an UNTALK command
    Call address: $FFAB (hex) 65451 (decimal)
    Communication registers: None
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns: See READST
    Stack requirements: 8
    Registers affected: A

    Description: This routine transmits an UNTALK command on the serial
  bus. All devices previously set to TALK will stop sending data when this
  command is received.

  How to Use:
    1) Call this routine.

  EXAMPLE:
    JSR UNTALK


  B-39. Function Name: VECTOR

    Purpose: Manage RAM vectors
    Call address: $FF8D (hex) 65421 (decimal)
    Communication registers: X, Y
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns: None
    Stack requirements: 2
    Registers affected: A, X, Y


    Description: This routine manages all system vector jump addresses
  stored in RAM. Calling this routine with the the accumulator carry bit
  set stores the current contents of the RAM vectors in a list pointed to
  by the X and Y registers. When this routine is called with the carry
  clear, the user list pointed to by the X and Y registers is transferred
  to the system RAM vectors. The RAM vectors are listed in the memory map.

  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | NOTE: This routine requires caution in its use. The best way to use it|
  | is to first read the entire vector contents into the user area, alter |
  | the desired vectors, and then copy the contents back to the system    |
  | vectors.                                                              |
  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

  How to Use:

  READ THE SYSTEM RAM VECTORS

    1) Set the carry.
    2) Set the X and y registers to the address to put the vectors.
    3) Call this routine.

  LOAD THE SYSTEM RAM VECTORS

    1) Clear the carry bit.
    2) Set the X and Y registers to the address of the vector list in RAM
       that must be loaded.
    3) Call this routine.

  ERROR CODES

    The following is a list of error messages which can occur when using
  the KERNAL routines. If an error occurs during a KERNAL routine , the
  carry bit of the accumulator is set, and the number of the error message
  is returned in the accumulator.
  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | NOTE: Some KERNAL I/O routines do not use these codes for error       |
  | messages. Instead, errors are identified using the KERNAL READST      |
  | routine.                                                              |
