# ********* - FIN (convert ASCII string to floating point FAC1 — used by VAL), FINLOG (add signed integer digit to FAC1 during parsing), and NO999 (table of three floating point constants: 99,999,999.5; 999,999,999.5; 1,000,000,000 used during string-to-FP conversion). Covers the internals of parsing ASCII numeric strings into floating point representation and constants used for range handling.

48371         $BCF3          FIN
Convert an ASCII String to a Floating Point Number FAC1

This routine is called by VAL to evaluate and convert an ASCII string
to a floating point number.

48510         $BD7E          FINLOG
Add Signed Integer to FAC1

This routine is used to add an ASCII digit that has been converted to
a signed integer to FAC1.

48563         $BDB3          NO999

This table of three floating point constants holds the values
99,999,999.5, 999,999,999.5 and 1,000,000,000.  These values are used
in converting strings to floating point numbers.
