# Kick Assembler - Describes using '@' when defining labels inside a nested scope to place them into the root scope. Examples: jsr outside_label rts { @outside_label: lda #0 sta $d020 rts }

If you declare a scope after a label you can access the labels inside the scope as fields on the declared label.
This is handy if you use scoping to make the labels of your functions local:
lda #’ ‘
sta clearScreen.fillbyte+1
jsr clearScreen
rts
clearScreen: {
fillbyte: lda #0
