# NMOS 6510 - Processor status flags summary: N (Negative), V (Overflow), B (Break), D (Decimal), I (Interrupt), Z (Zero), C (Carry). Also explains notation used to indicate instruction dependence/usage of flags: 'i' = depends on (input only), 'o' = sets/clears (output only), 'x' = both depends on and changes the flag.

C

To indicate what processor flags are used and/or modified by the respective instructions this
document uses a slightly different notation than many other existing ones. In particular this will
allow to indicate directly in the tables whether an instruction depends on, modifies, or just sets a
flag.
i

The instruction depends on this flag (takes it as INPUT) but does not change it. In this
document this applies to the decimal flag only.

o

The instruction does not depend on this flag, but does set or clear it (it is OUTPUT only).
The zero flag is a typical example for this (only branches depend on it, other instruction
would only set it)

x

The instruction depends on this flag, and does change it too. The carry flag is a typical
example for this (although not generally in all instructions).
The instruction does not depend on, nor change, this flag

Opcode Matrix
The instructions of the 6502 are compressed into a 130-entry decode ROM. Instead of 256 entries
telling how to process each separate opcode, it's encoded as combinatorial logic post-processing the
output of a "sparse" ROM that acts in some ways like a programmable logic array (PLA).
Many instructions activate multiple lines of the decode ROM at once. Often this is on purpose, such
as one line for the addressing mode and one for the opcode part. But many of the unintended
