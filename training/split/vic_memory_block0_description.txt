# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - VIC-II bank/block 0 description (addresses 0-16383 / Block 0): normally used for system variables and BASIC text; default screen memory at 1024-2047 ($400-$7FF). Character generator ROM is seen by VIC-II at $1000-$1FFF reducing available graphics RAM; small free areas exist for limited sprite or character data; recommends adjusting BASIC memory pointers to free more space if needed.

                          Block 0.  This is normally used for system variables and BASIC program
                          text.  Locations 1024-2047 ($400-$7FF) are reserved for the default
                          position of screen memory.

                          There is an addition limitation on memory usage of this block, as the
                          VIC-II sees the character generator ROM at 4096-8191 ($1000-$1FFF),
                          making this portion of memory unavailable for other graphics data.
                          Generally, there is little free space here for graphics display data.
                          Locations 679-767 ($2A7- $2FF) are unused, and could hold one sprite
                          shape (number 11) or data for 11 characters.  The area from 820-1023
                          ($334-$3FF), which includes the cassette I/O buffer, is available for
                          graphics memory, and is large enough to hold three sprite shapes
                          (numbers 13, 14, and 15), or data for 25 characters (numbers 103-127).
                          But getting enough memory for bitmap graphics requires that you either
                          reserve memory after the end of BASIC text by lowering the end of
                          BASIC pointer at 56 ($38), or raise the start of BASIC pointer at 44
                          ($2C).  See the entries for these pointers for more details.
