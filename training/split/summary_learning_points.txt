# MACHINE - Concise summary of Chapter 1 takeaways: computers use binary; hex is a human shorthand; 650x addresses memory via the memory bus; 650x has internal registers (PC, A/X/Y, SR, SP); PC points to next instruction; A/X/Y are used to load/store data; 650x uses little-endian address ordering (low byte first); and the machine language monitor provides a direct hexadecimal interface to inspect/change memory.



Things You Have Learned
-----------------------

- Computers use binary.  If we want to work with the inner fabric of the
  computer, we must come to terms with binary values.

- Hexadecimal notation is for humans, not for computers.  It's a less clumsy
  way for people to cope with binary numbers.

- The 650x microprocessor chip communicates with memory by sending an address
  over its memory bus.

- The 650x has internal work areas called registers.

- The program counter tells us the address from which the processor will get
  its next instruction.

                                                                         :20:

- Three registers, called A, X, and Y, are used to hold and manipulate data.
  They may be loaded from memory, and stored into memory.

- Addresses used in 650x instructions are "flipped:" the low byte comes
  first, followed by the high byte.

- The machine language monitor gives us a new type of communications path
  into the computer.  Among other things, it allows us to inspect and change
  memory in hexadecimal.
