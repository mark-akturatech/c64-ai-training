# ********* - LA ($B8) — Holds the logical file number for the device currently in use. Notes maximum open files (five disk files, ten total), valid file number range (1–255; 0 = system defaults), special behavior when the logical file number is >127 (an ASCII linefeed is sent after each carriage return), and that the BASIC OPEN command (e.g. OPEN 4,8,15) sets this location (logical file number corresponds to the first OPEN parameter).

Current Logical File Number

This location holds the logical file number of the device currently
being used.  A maximum of five disk files, and ten files in total, may
be open at any one time.

File numbers range from 1 to 255 (a 0 is used to indicate system
defaults).  When printing to a device with a file number greater than
127, an ASCII linefeed character will be sent following each carriage
return, which is useful for devices like serial printers that require
linefeeds in addition to carriage returns.

The BASIC OPEN command calls the Kernal OPEN routine, which sets the
value of this location.  In the BASIC statement OPEN 4,8,15, the
logical file number corresponds to the first parameter 4.
