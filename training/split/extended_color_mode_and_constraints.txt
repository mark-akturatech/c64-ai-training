# COMMODORE 64 - Extended color mode (ECM = 1, BMM = MCM = 0): selecting ECM via register 17 ($11) and how it allows per-character background selection while keeping 8x8 resolution. Explains that character dot data is displayed as in standard mode for bit values, but the two MSB of the character pointer are repurposed to select one of four background colors (mapping of CHAR POINTER MSB pair to background registers 33-36). Notes that only 64 character definitions remain available because the VIC-II forces CB10 and CB9 to 0, and states that each character has one of 16 foregrounds and one of 4 backgrounds. Includes the explicit NOTE that ECM and MCM should not be enabled simultaneously.

  EXTENDED COLOR MODE (ECM = 1, Bmm = MCM = 0)

    The extended color mode allows the selection of individual, background
  colors for each character region with the normal 8*8 character
  resolution. This mode is selected by setting the ECM bit of register 17
  ($11) to "1". The character dot data is displayed as in the standard mode
  (foreground color determined by the color nybble is displayed for a "1"

  data bit), but the 2 MSB of the character pointer are used to select the
  background color for each character region as follows:


       CHAR. POINTER  |
        MS BIT PAIR   |       BACKGROUND COLOR DISPLAYED FOR 0 BIT
  --------------------+----------------------------------------------------
           00         |  Background #0 color (register 33 ($21))
           01         |  Background #l color (register 34 ($22))
           10         |  Background #2 color (register 35 ($23))
           11         |  Background #3 color (register 36 ($24))

  Since the two MSB of the character pointers are used for color informa-
  tion, only 64 different character definitions are available. The 6566/
  6567 will force CB10 and CB9 to "0" regardless of the original pointer
  values, so that only the first 64 character definitions will be accessed.
  With extended color mode each character has one of sixteen individually
  defined foreground colors and one of the four available background
  colors.
