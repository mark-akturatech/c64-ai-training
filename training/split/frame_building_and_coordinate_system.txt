# The MOS 6567/6569 video controller (VIC-II) and its application in the Commodore 64 - How the VIC constructs the video frame line-by-line; character-based graphics (8x8 pixels per character), text and bitmap resolutions (40x25 text, 320x200 or 160x200 bitmap); use of raster line number (RASTER, $D011/$D012) as Y coordinate and the sprite-based X coordinate (8 pixels per CPU cycle), including the relation between cycle numbers and sprite X precision.

3.4. Display generation and display window dimensions
-----------------------------------------------------

As usual for controlling CRTs, the VIC builds the video frame line by line.
The line number and the number of clock cycles per line are constant for
every VIC type. The VIC works character-based, every character consists of
a matrix of 8�8 pixels, so a text line is made up of 8 pixel lines. 40�25
text characters are displayed in the text based modes, 320�200 or 160�200
pixels in the bitmap modes.

In this article, the specification of a position on the screen is done with
the raster line number as the Y coordinate (RASTER, register $d011/$d012)
and a X coordinate that corresponds to the sprite coordinate system. When
specifying the time of a VIC memory access or an internal operation in the
VIC, the raster line number is used as Y coordinate and the number of the
clock cycle within the line as X coordinate. As previously mentioned, 8
pixels make a clock cycle, so the specification of a sprite X coordinate is
eight times more precise than that of a cycle number.
