# The MOS 6567/6569 video controller (VIC-II) and its application in the Commodore 64 - Explains Y coordinate alignment and start timing: because the rule-3 test (DMA enable) runs at the end of a raster line, sprite Y registers must hold a value one less than the desired Y for the first visible sprite line. Sprite display begins on the following line after the first sprite data read — unless the sprite is positioned to the right of X coordinate $164 (cycle 58, referenced in rule 4).

As the test in rule 3 is done at the end of a raster line, the sprite Y
coordinates stored in the registers must be 1 less than the desired Y
position of the first sprite line, as the sprite display will not start
until the following line, after the first sprite data has been read (as
long as the sprite is not positioned to the right of sprite X coordinate
$164 (cycle 58, see rule 4)).
