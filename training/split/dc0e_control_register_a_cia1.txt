# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - CIA #1 Control Register A at $DC0E (CIACRA): bit 0 start/stop Timer A; bit 1 select Timer A output on Port B (appears on PB6); bit 2 port B output mode toggle/pulse; bit 3 Timer A one-shot/continuous; bit 4 force load latched Timer A value; bit 5 Timer A input mode (count CPU cycles or CNT line pulses); bit 6 serial port mode (1=output, 0=input); bit 7 TOD frequency selection (1=50Hz, 0=60Hz). Details on Timer A operation, PB6 signaling (toggle vs pulse), force load usage, input source selection (CPU cycles vs CNT).

                          Bit 6.  Whether the Serial Port Register is currently inputting or
                          outputting data (see the entry for that register at 56332 ($DC0C) for
                          more information) is controlled by this bit.

                          Bit 7.  This bit allows you to select from software whether the Time
                          of Day Clock will use a 50 Hz or 60 Hz signal on the TOD pin in order
                          to keep accurate time (the 64 uses a 60 Hz signal on that pin).
