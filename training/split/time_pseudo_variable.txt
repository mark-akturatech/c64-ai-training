# ca65 Users Guide - .TIME: returns the current translation time as a POSIX integer (seconds since the Epoch). Useful to embed the translation time into generated code; example shows storing .time as a 32-bit value with .dword.

9.6 .TIME
Reading this pseudo variable will give a constant integer value that represents the current time in POSIX standard (as seconds since the Epoch).

It may be used to encode the time of translation somewhere in the created code.

Example:


        .dword  .time   ; Place time here
