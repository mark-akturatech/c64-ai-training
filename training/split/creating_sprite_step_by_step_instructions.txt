# COMMODORE 64 - Step-by-step guide to create a sprite: draw on the 24x21 grid, take groups of 8 horizontal pixels and compute decimal values with bit weights (128..1), enter those values as DATA for each group (3 numbers per row, 21 rows -> 63 values). Shows example of fully solid first three groups as 255 and explains filling DATA statements line-by-line and compressing them into a crunched DATA block.

  CREATING A SPRITE... STEP BY STEP

    To make this as easy as possible for you, we've put together this
  simple step by step guide to help you draw your own sprites.

  STEP 1:

  Write the spritemaking program shown here ON A PIECE OF PAPER... note
  that line 100 starts a special DATA section of your program which will
  contain the 63 numbers you need to create your sprite.

  STEP 2:

  Color in the pixels on the spritemaking grid on Page 162 (or use a piece
  of graph paper... remember, a sprite has 24 squares across and 21 squares
  down). We suggest you use a pencil and draw lightly so you can reuse this
  grid. You can create any image you like, but for our example we'll draw
  a simple box.

  STEP 3:

  Look at the first EIGHT pixels. Each column of pixels has a number (128,
  64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1). The special type of addition we are going to
  show you is a type of BINARY ARITHMETIC which is used by most computers

  as a special way of counting. Here's a close-up view of the first eight
  pixels in the top left hand corner of the sprite:

       |128| 64| 32| 16|  8|  4|  2|  1|
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
       |@@@|@@@|@@@|@@@|@@@|@@@|@@@|@@@|
       |@@@|@@@|@@@|@@@|@@@|@@@|@@@|@@@|
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  STEP 4:

  Add up the numbers of the SOLID pixels. This first group of eight pixels
  is completely solid, so the total number is 255.

  STEP 5:

  Enter that number as the FIRST DATA STATEMENT in line 100 of the
  Spritemaking Program below. Enter 255 for the second and third groups
  of eight.

  STEP 6:

  Look at the FIRST EIGHT PIXELS IN THE SECOND ROW of the sprite. Add up
  the values of the solid pixels. Since only one of these pixels is solid,
  the total value is 128. Enter this as the first DATA number in line 101.

       |128| 64| 32| 16|  8|  4|  2|  1|
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
       |@@@|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
       |@@@|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  STEP 7:

  Add up the values of the next group of eight pixels (which is 0 because
  they're all BLANK) and enter in line 101. Now move to the next group of
  pixels and repeat the process for each GROUP OF EIGHT PIXELS (there are
  3 groups across each row, and 21 rows). This will give you a total of 63
  numbers. Each number represents ONE group of 8 pixels, and 63 groups of
  eight equals 504 total individual pixels. Perhaps a better way of looking
  at the program is like this... each line in the program represents ONE
  ROW in the sprite. Each of the 3 numbers in each row represents ONE GROUP
  OF EIGHT PIXELS. And each number tells the computer which pixels to make
  SOLID and which pixels to leave blank.
