# COMMODORE 64 - PROGRAM FLOW: Control-flow statements in BASIC: GOTO (branch to line), IF ... THEN (conditional execution), FOR ... TO ... STEP ... / NEXT (loops and step size; NEXT A optional), GOSUB/RETURN (subroutines and returning), ON X GOTO A,B (computed GOTO), ON X GOSUB A,B (computed GOSUB). Examples include FOR A=1 TO 10 STEP 2 and GOSUB 2000/RETURN behavior.

  PROGRAM FLOW

  GOTO X        Branches to line X
  IF A=1 TO 10  IF assertion is true THEN execute following part of
                statement. IF false, execute next line number
  FOR A=1 TO 10 STEP 2   Executes all statements between FOR and
                         corresponding NEXT, with A going from 1 to 10
                         by 2. Step size is 1 unless specified
  NEXT A        Defines end of loop. A is optional
  GOSUB 2000    Branches to subtoutine starting at line 2000
  RETURN        Marks end of subroutine. Returns to statement following
                most recent GOSUB
  ON X GOTO A,B Branches to Xth line number on list. If X=1 branches
                to A, etc.
  ON X GOSUB A,B Branches to subroutine at Xth line number in list
