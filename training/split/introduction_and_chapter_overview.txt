# MACHINE - Introductory motivation for learning machine language (speed, versatility, comprehension), portability of skills across systems, prerequisites, and an overview of Chapter 1 topics (inner workings, binary/hex notation, 650x architecture, machine language monitor, first commands, simple program).

  Why learn machine language?  There are three reasons.  First, for speed;
machine language programs are fast.  Second, for versatility; all other
languages are limited in some way, but not machine language.  Third, for
comprehension; since the computer really works in machine language only, the
key to understanding how the machine operates is machine language.
  Is it hard?  Not really.  It's finicky, but not difficult.  Individual
machine language instructions don't do much, so we need many of them to do a
job.  But each instruction is simply, and anyone can understand it if he or
she has the patience.
  Some programmers who started their careers in machine language find "higher
level" languages such as BASIC quite difficult by comparison.  To them,
machine language instructions are simple and precise, whereas BASIC
statements seem vague and poorly defined by comparison.
  Where will this book take you?  You will end up with a good understanding
of what machine language is, and the principles of how to program in it.  You
won't be an expert, but you'll have a good start and will no longer be
frightened by this seemingly mysterious language.
  Will the skills you learn be transportable to other machines?  Certainly.
Once you understand the principles of programming, you'll be able to adapt.
If you were to change to a non-Commodore machine that used the 6502 chip
(such as Apple or Atari), you'd need to learn about the architecture of these
machines an about their machine language monitors.  They would be different,
but the same principles would apply on all of them.
  Even if you change to a computer that doesn't use a chip from the 6502
family, you will be able to adapt.  As you pick through the instructions and
bits of the Commodore machine, you will have learned about the principles of
all binary computers.  You will need to learn the new microprocessor's
instruction set, but it will be much easier the second time around.
  Do you need to be a BASIC expert before tackling machine language?  Not at
all.  This book assumes you know a little about programming fundamentals:
loops, branching, subroutines, and decision making.  But you don't need to be
an advanced programmer to learn machine language.
