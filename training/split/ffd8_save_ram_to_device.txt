# C64 KERNAL API (Lee Davison) - $FFD8 — Save RAM to a device. Saves memory from an indirect address on page zero (specified by A) to the address in XY to a logical file. Requires SETLFS and SETNAM first. Filename optional for cassette (device 1) but required for other devices. Device 0 (keyboard) and 3 (screen) cannot be SAVEd to (error if attempted).

$FFD8          save RAM to a device
               
               This routine saves a section of memory. Memory is saved from an indirect address
               on page 0 specified by A, to the address stored in XY, to a logical file. The
               SETLFS, $FFBA, and SETNAM, $FFBD, routines must be used before calling this
               routine. However, a file name is not required to SAVE to device 1, the cassette.
               Any attempt to save to other devices without using a file name results in an error.
               
               NOTE: device 0, the keyboard, and device 3, the screen, cannot be SAVEd to. If
               the attempt is made, an error will occur, and the SAVE stopped.
