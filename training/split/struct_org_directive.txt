# ca65 Users Guide - The .ORG keyword inside structs changes the offset assigned to subsequent member names — useful for mapping hardware registers. Example: .struct ACIA with .org $031C followed by DATA/.byte, STATUS/.byte, CMD/.byte, CTRL/.byte and usage: lda ACIA::DATA.


15.4 The .ORG keyword
The .ORG keyword changes the offset value that is assigned to subsequent member names. It's useful when using a struct to define the names of the registers in an I/O chip. Example:

; 6551
.struct ACIA            ; Asynchronous Communications Interface Adapter
        .org    $031C
DATA    .byte
STATUS  .byte
CMD     .byte           ; Command register
CTRL    .byte           ; Control register
.endstruct

        lda     ACIA::DATA      ; Get an RS-232 character
