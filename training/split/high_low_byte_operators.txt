# Kick Assembler - Explains the 65xx-specific high (>) and low (<) byte operators with examples. Shows typical usage with lda #<interrupt1 / sta $0314 and lda #>interrupt1 / sta $0315 and comments indicating these take the low and high byte of a symbol/address respectively.

Special for 65xx assemblers are the high and low-byte operators (>,<) that are typically used like this:
lda #<interrupt1
sta $0314
lda #>interrupt1
sta $0315

// Takes the lowbyte of the interupt1 value
// Takes the high byte of the interupt1 value
