# COMMODORE 64 - ALGEBRAIC, RELATIONAL AND LOGICAL OPERATORS: Lists BASIC arithmetic operators (= assignment, -, ^, *, /, +, -), relational operators (=, <>, <, >, <=, >=), and logical operators (NOT, AND, OR). Notes that expressions evaluate to 1 if true and 0 if false.

  = Assigns value to variable     =   Equal
  - Negation                      <>  Not Equal To
  ^ Exponentiation                <   Less Than
  * Multiplication                >   Greater Than
  / Division                      <=  Less Than or Equal To
  + Addition                      >=  Greater Than or Equal To
  - Substraction                  NOT Logical "Not"
                                  AND Logical "And"
                                  OR  Logical "Or"
                                  Expression equals 1 if true, 0 if false
