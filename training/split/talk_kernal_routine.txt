    Registers affected: A

    Description: To use this routine the accumulator must first be loaded
  with a device number between 0 and 31. When called, this routine then
  ORs bit by bit to convert this device number to a talk address. Then this
  data is transmitted as a command on the serial bus.

  How to Use:

    1) Load the accumulator with the device number.
