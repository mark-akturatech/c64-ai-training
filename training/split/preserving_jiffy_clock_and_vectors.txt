# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Notes about the system default IRQ vector: on power-up the IRQ vector points to the jiffy clock/hardware timer routine (keyboard and clock). Recommendation to turn off the hardware timer interrupt by writing 127 to $DC0D (56333) if not needed, and guidance on preserving and chaining the original vector so keyboard and jiffy clock can still function while using a custom raster ISR.

                          When the computer is first turned on, the interrupt vector is set to
                          point to the normal hardware timer interrupt routine, the one that
                          advances the jiffy clock and reads the keyboard.  Since this interrupt
                          routine uses the same vector as the raster interrupt routine, it is
                          best to turn off the hardware timer interrupt by putting a value of
                          127 in location 56333 ($DC0D).

                          If you want the keyboard and jiffy clock to function normally while
                          your interrupt is enabled, you must preserve the contents of locations
                          788 and 789 before you change them to point to your new routine.  Then
                          you must have your interrupt routine jump to the old interrupt routine
                          exactly once per screen refresh (every 1/60 second).
