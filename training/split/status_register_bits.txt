# - C64 RAM Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Status (.P) register bit assignments and cautions: Bit 7 Negative (128), Bit 6 Overflow (64), Bit 5 Not used (32), Bit 4 BREAK (16), Bit 3 Decimal (8), Bit 2 Interrupt Disable (4), Bit 1 Zero (2), Bit 0 Carry (1). Advises safe clearing before SYS (POKE 783,0) and warns about Interrupt Disable flag (SEI behavior); suggests POKE 783,247 to set all except Interrupt disable.

                     The Status (.P) register has seven different flags.  Their bit
                     assignments are as follows:
                     
                     |Bit|Value|                   |
                     |---|-----|-------------------|
                     | 7 | 128 | Negative          |
                     | 6 | 64  | Overflow          |
                     | 5 | 32  | Not Used          |
                     | 4 | 16  | BREAK             |
                     | 3 | 8   | Decimal           |
                     | 2 | 4   | Interrupt Disable |
                     | 1 | 2   | Zero              |
                     | 0 | 1   | Carry             |
                     
                     If you wish to clear any flag before a SYS, it is safe to clear them
                     all with a POKE 783,0.  The reverse is not true, however, as you must
                     watch out for the Interrupt disable flag.
                     
                     A 1 in this flag bit is equal to an SEI instruction, which turns off
                     all IRQ interrupts (like the one that reads the keyboard, for
                     example).  Turning off the keyboard could make the computer very
                     difficult to operate!  To set all flags except for Interrupt disable
                     to 1, POKE 783,247.
