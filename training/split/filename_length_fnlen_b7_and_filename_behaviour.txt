# ********* - Covers FNLEN ($B7), which holds the length of the current filename and the behavior differences between disk and tape files. Disk filenames: 1–16 characters; tape filenames: 0–187 characters. Notes on truncation of long tape names in messages, using tape filenames for machine-language program storage, the meaning of FNLEN being zero for unnamed tape operations, and that an RS-232 OPEN command may specify a 4-character filename copied to locations 659–662 ($293–$296) to determine baud rate, word length, and parity.

Length of Current Filename

This location holds the number of characters in the current filename.
Disk filenames may have from 1 to 16 characters, while tape filenames
range from 0 to 187 characters in length.

If the tape name is longer than 16 characters, the excess will be
truncated by the SEARCHING and FOUND messages, but will still be
present on the tape.  This means that machine language programs meant
to run in the cassette buffer may be saved as tape filenames.

A disk file is always referred to be a name, whether full or generic
(containing the wildcard characters * or ?).  This location will
always be greater than 0 if the current file is a disk file.  Tape
LOAD, SAVE, and VERIFY operations do not require that a name be
specified, and this location can therefore contain a 0.  If this is
the case, the contents of the pointer to the filename at 187 will be
irrelevant.

An RS-232 OPEN command may specify a filename of up to four
characters.  These characters are copied to locations 659-662
($293-$296), and determine baud rate, word length, and parity.
