# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - How to employ user-defined characters: choose a video memory bank (via CIA #2 Port A bits), set the 2K character memory pointer in VIC-II register $D018 (53272), place shape data into chosen memory. Notes about copying part of ROM character set to RAM if desired (see location 1 entry for ROM reading).

                          To employ user-defined characters, you must first pick a spot to put
                          the shape data.  This requires choosing a bank of 16K for video chip
                          memory (see the entry under Bits 0-1 of 56576 ($DD00) for the
                          considerations involved), and setting the pointer to the 2K area of
                          character memory in 53272 ($D018).  It is then up to you to supply the
                          shape data for the characters.  You can use part of the ROM character
                          set by reading the ROM and transferring the data to your character
                          shape area (see the entry for location 1 for a method of reading the
                          ROM).
