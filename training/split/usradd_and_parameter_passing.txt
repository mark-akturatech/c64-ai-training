# - C64 RAM Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $0311-$0312 USRADD: address of the USR routine (low byte first). Explains initialization to point to BASIC error handler, how to POKE low/high bytes (HI=INT(AD/256):LO=AD-(HI*256)), example for 49152 ($C000). Describes USR(parameter) passing: parameter placed in FAC1 as floating point; machine routine can read/return values via FAC1. Describes vectored routines to convert FAC1 to signed integer (low byte in .Y/loc101, high byte in A) and to convert signed integer (A high byte, Y low byte) back to FAC1 via JMP ($0005).

$0311-$0312  USRADD  Address of USR Routine (Low Byte First)
                     
                     These locations contain the target address of the USR command.  They
                     are initialized by the Operating System to point to the BASIC error
                     message handler routine, so that if you try to execute a USR call
                     without changing these values, you will receive an ILLEGAL QUANTITY
                     error message.
                     
                     In order to successfully execute a USR call, you must first POKE in
                     the target address in low-byte, high-byte order.  You can calculate
                     these two values for any address with the formula:
                     
                         HI=INT(AD/256):LO=AD-(HI*256)
                     
                     For example, if the USR routine started at 49152 ($C000), you would
                     POKE 786, INT(49152/256):POKE 785,49152-(PEEK(786)*256 before
                     executing the USR command.
                     
                     What makes the USR command different from SYS is that you can pass a
                     parameter into the machine language routine by placing it in
                     parenthesis after the USR keyword, and you can pass a parameter back
                     to a variable by assigning its value to the USR function.
                     
                     In other words, the statement X=USR(50) will first put the number 50
                     in floating point format into the Floating Point Accumulator (FAC1) at
                     97-102 ($0061-$0066).  Then, the machine language program designated by
                     the address at this vector will be executed.  Finally, the variable X
                     will be assigned the floating point value which ends up in FAC1 after
                     the user-written routine is finished.
                     
                     Since floating point representation is difficult to work with, it is
                     handy to change these floating point parameters into integers before
                     working with them.  Fortunately, there are vectored routines which
                     will do the conversions for you.  The routine vectored at locations
                     3-4 converts the number in FAC1 to a two-byte signed integer, with the
                     low byte in the .Y register (and location 101 ($0065)) and the high byte
                     in the Accumulator (.A).  Remember, that number is converted to a
                     signed integer in the range between 32767 and -32768, with Bit 7 of
                     the high byte used to indicate the sign.
                     
                     To pass a value back through the USR function, you need to place the
                     number into FAC1.  To convert a signed integer to floating point
                     format, place the high byte into the Accumulator (.A), the low byte
                     into the .Y register, and jump through the vector at locations 5-6
                     with a JMP ($0005) instruction.  The floating point result will be
                     left in FAC1.
