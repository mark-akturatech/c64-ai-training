Chapter 4 
The 6510 Assembly Language 



In Appendix A are a series of charts that describe 
all of the instructions available in the 6510 as well 
as their addressing mode options. You may wish to 
refer to these charts as you are reading the follow- 
ing sections on instruction types and addressing 
modes. As you begin to program in assembly 
language, you will find yourself constantly refer- 
ring to these charts. 

All of the instruction lines used in assembly 
language take the following format: 

LABEL OPCODE OPERAND ;comment 

The opcode is the instruction that you want ex- 
ecuted. The operand is the data, label, or memory 
address that will be operated on. 

Comments are particularly useful in document- 
ing your program and should be used often. A prop- 
erly documented program is much easier to read 
and understand. A comment can either follow an 
instruction or be on a line by itself. A comment must 
be preceded by a semicolon. 



Labels prevent assembly language from becom- 
ing unmanageable. A label must start in column 1 
of the program line. A label can be assigned a value 
or can take on the value of the program counter dur- 
ing assembly. When used as the operand in a branch 
instruction, the assembler determines the length of 
a branch, which is much easier than calculating the 
branch distance by hand. Also, if a change is made 
in the program, the assembler can compensate for 
any changes in the branch. If the calculations are 
done by hand, they have to be redone every time 
there is a change.
