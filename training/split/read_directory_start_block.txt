# byRiclianll - Issue a DOS memory-read (M-R) to query the device for the file's directory/block information and capture the return bytes T and S. Sends the M-R command (PRINT#15,"M-R" + CHR$(...)) on channel 15, reads T* and S* via GET#15, converts them to numeric values with ASC( ... + CHR$(0) ), closes channel 2, reads the command status (INPUT#15,EN*,EM*,ET*,ES*), and branches on success or error to subsequent routines.

400  PRINT#15, "M-R"CHR* (24) CHR* (O) CHR* (2) 

410  GET#15,T* 

420  T= ASC ( T*+CHR* ( O ) ) 

430  GET#15,S* 

440  S=ASC(S*+CHR*<0) )
