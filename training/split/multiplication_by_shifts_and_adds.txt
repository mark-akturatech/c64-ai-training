# MACHINE - Multiplication techniques using shifts and adds: multiply by two via ASL, combine ASL/ROL for multi-byte. To multiply by 4 or 8, repeat shifts. To multiply by 10: multiply by 2 twice (x4), add original (x5), then multiply by 2 again (x10). Typical use: building decimal input routines where digits are accumulated via multiply-by-ten and add.

Multiplication
--------------

Multiplying by two may not seem too powerful.  We can build on this starting
point, however, and arrange to multiply by any number we choose.

                                                                         :63:

                                                ASL         0
                                               +---------+  |
                                               |         |  |
                                            ,---- <- <- <---'
                                            |  |         |
                              ROL           |  +---------+
                             +---------+    |   LOW ORDER BYTE
                             |         |    v
                          ,---- <- <- <---CARRY
                          |  |         |
            ROL           |  +---------+
           +----------+   |
           |          |   v
        ,---- <- <- <---CARRY
        |  |          |
        |  +----------+
        |   HIGH ORDER BYTE
        v

   TO MULTIPLY A THREE-BYTE NUMBER BY TWO, WE SHIFT THE LOW ORDER
   BYTE WITH ASL; THEN WE USE ROL TO ALLOW THE C FLAG TO "LINK" FROM
   ONE BYTE TO THE NEXT.

We won't deal with a generalized multiplication routine here, but a couple
of specific examples can be shown.

How can we multiply by four?  Multiply by two, twice.  How can we multiply by
eight?  Multiply by two, three times.

Here's an important one.  We often want to multiply by ten.  For example, if
a decimal number is being typed in at the keyboard, the number will arrive
one digit at a time.  The user might type 217, for example.  The program must
then input the two and put it away; when the one arrives, the two must be
multiplied by ten, giving twenty, and the one added; when the seven is typed,
the twenty-one must be multiplied by ten before the seven is added.  Result:
217 in binary.  But we must first know how to multiply by ten.

To multiply by ten, you first multiply by two; then multiply by two again.
At this point, we have the original number times four.  Now, add the original
number, giving the original number times five.  Multiply by two one last time
and you've got it.  We'll see an example of this in Chapter 7.
