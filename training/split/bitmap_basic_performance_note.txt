# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Note: BASIC plotting in hi-res is slow; machine language recommended. Reference to article 'Hi-Res Graphics Made Simple' for better BASIC replacements.


                          As you can see, using BASIC to draw in bit-graphics mode is somewhat
                          slow and tedious.  Machine language is much more suitable for
                          bit-graphics plotting.  For a program that lets you replace some BASIC
                          commands with high-res drawing commands, see the article "Hi-Res
                          Graphics Made Simple," by Paul F. Schatz, in COMPUTE!'s First Book of
                          Commodore 64 Sound and Graphics.
