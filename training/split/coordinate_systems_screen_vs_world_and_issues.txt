# Multidirectional Scrolling Techniques by Cadaver - Discussion of coordinate systems: using screen (sprite) coordinates is fastest but can cause incorrect behavior near screen edges (example: Turrican enemies acting erratically). Recommends using a world-coordinate system and checking collisions against map & block data rather than relying solely on on-screen data.

3. Coordinate systems

How do you represent the location of the objects onscreen? If you really care
only about things on the screen, you could use the screen-coordinate system
that the sprites use. This method is obviously best for speed, but has its
drawbacks.

Look at Turrican, when the "walker" enemies move near the boundaries of the
visible screen. They sometimes behave very erratically. Turrican is a master-
piece otherwise so this can be forgiven, but I wouldn't tolerate this in my own
programs...

Why are they behaving so? Because they're only using the screen coordinate
system, and checking only the characters on screen for background collisions.
In some cases checking outside the screen would happen and the collision
routine probably has a hardcoded response of either "obstacle" or "free space"
in that case. This is fast, but honestly, incorrect.
