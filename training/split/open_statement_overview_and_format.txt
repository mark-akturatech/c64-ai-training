# COMMODORE 64 - Defines the OPEN statement: its TYPE (I/O), FORMAT (OPEN <file-num>,[<device>][,<address>][,"<File-name> [,<type>] [,<mode>] "]), and the action (opens a channel for I/O). Notes that not all parts are required for every OPEN and that some OPENs require only two codes: logical file number and device number.
