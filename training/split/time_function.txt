# COMMODORE 64 - TI$ (TIME$) string: returns a 6-character HHMMSS string representing time while system powered on. Can be assigned an arbitrary starting point. Not accurate after tape I/O. Example showing manual initialization and increment loop printing TI$.

  TIME$

  TYPE: String Function
  FORMAT: TI$

    Action: The TI$ timer looks and works like a real clock as long as your
  system is powered-on. The hardware interval timer (or jiffy clock) is
  read and used to update the value of TI$, which will give you a TIme
  $tring of six characters in hours, minutes and seconds. The TI$ timer can
  also be assigned an arbitrary starting point similar to the way you set
  your wristwatch. The value of TI$ is not accurate after tape I/O.

  EXAMPLE of TI$ Function:

    1 TI$ = "000000": FOR J=1 TO 10000: NEXT: PRINT TI$

    000011
