# Contents - Explains that source must be assembled after editing, defines a coresident assembler (all tools loaded simultaneously), describes the convenience of coresident systems for quick test-assemble cycles, and strongly recommends saving source frequently to avoid data loss if the system locks up.

Once the program has been entered into the 
editor, it must be assembled before it can be used. 
Some assembler packages force you to load the 
assembler at this point, while others already have 
it loaded. An assembler that has all of the programs 
you need loaded simultaneously is called a coresi- 
dent assembler. 

A coresident assembler can save you quite a bit 
of time if you like to write a small section of code 
and immediately try to assemble it to check for er- 
rors. If you have a coresident package, remember 
always to save your source code before attempting 
to run your program. You can lose all of your latest 
work if your new program locks up the computer, 



forcing you to turn it off. In fact, no matter what 
type of assembler you are using, you should save 
your source code often as you are writing it.
