# COMMODORE 64 - How strings are compared using relational operators: left-to-right character code comparison using PET/CBM character set, shorter string considered less if prefix equal, leading/trailing blanks significant. Comparisons always produce an integer result (-1 or 0) usable in calculations except as divisor.

  STRING OPERATIONS

    Strings are compared using the same relational operators (=, <>,
  <=, >=, <, >) that are used for comparing numbers. String compari-
  sons are mode by taking one character at a time (left-to-right) from
  each string and evaluating each character code position from the PET/
  CBM character set. If the character codes are the same, the characters
  are equal. If the character codes differ, the character with the lower
  code number is lower in the character set. The comparison stops when

    the end of either string is reached. All other things being equal, the
  shorter string is considered less than the longer string. Leading or
  trailing blanks ARE significant.
    Regardless of the data types, at the end of all comparisons you get
  an integer result. This is true even if both operands are strings.
  Because of this a comparison of two string operands can be used as an
  operand in performing calculations. The result will be - 1 or 0 (true or
  false) and can be used as anything but a divisor since division by zero
  is illegal.
