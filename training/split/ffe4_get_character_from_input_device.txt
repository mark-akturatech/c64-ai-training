# C64 KERNAL API (Lee Davison) - $FFE4 — Get character from input device. Operates like CHRIN ($FFCF) for all devices except keyboard. For keyboard, reads one character from keyboard buffer filled by IRQ routine; returns 0 if buffer empty. Depends on IRQ-based keyboard handling.

$FFE4          get character from input device
               
               In practice this routine operates identically to the CHRIN routine, $FFCF,
               for all devices except for the keyboard. If the keyboard is the current input
               device this routine will get one character from the keyboard buffer. It depends
               on the IRQ routine to read the keyboard and put characters into the buffer.
               
               If the keyboard buffer is empty the value returned in the accumulator will be zero.
