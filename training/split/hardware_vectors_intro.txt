# Analyzing C64 tape loaders - Introduces the 6510 hardware vectors area ($FFFA-$FFFF) and their purpose: NMI vector ($FFFA), RESET vector ($FFFC), and IRQ/BRK vector ($FFFE). Explains these are used by the CPU to jump to handlers on events like NMI/RESET/IRQ.

<code>
Location Range: 65530-65535 ($FFFA-$FFFF)
6510 Hardware Vectors
</code>

The last six locations in memory are reserved by the 6510 processor chip for three fixed vectors. These vectors let the chip know at what address to start executing machine language program code when an NMI interrupt occurs, when the computer is turned on, or when an IRQ interrupt or BRK occurs.
