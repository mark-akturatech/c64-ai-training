# byRiclianll - Explains the load address in bytes 2-3 of a PRG file's first sector. Example: BASIC programs saved from a C64 have $01/$08 indicating load at $0801 (decimal 2049). Discusses the effect of the optional relocation flag in LOAD commands (LOAD "name",8,1 vs LOAD "name",8) and how the presence/absence determines whether the load address is respected or the file is loaded at the default BASIC start.

file.  Technically,  this  is  known  as  a  "forward  pointer."  It  points  ahead  to  the  next  sec- 
tor in  the  file.  All  Commodore  files  use  this  type  of  pointer. 

The  second  pair  of  bytes  is  the  "load  address"  of  the  file  in  lo-byte/hi-byte  form.  They 
indicate  where  the  program  is  to  be  loaded  into  memory.  A  BASIC  program  that  was 
saved  from  a  C64  will  have  a  $01  and  a  $08  in  these  two  locations.  This  indicates  that 
the  program  is  to  be  loaded  into  memory  starting  at  memory  location  $0801  (remember 
it  is  in  lo-byte/hi-byte  form).  In  decimal  notation  this  is  memory  location  2049  —  the  start 
of  BASIC  on  a  C64.

Have  you  ever  wondered  about  the  significance  of  the  in  the  command  LOAD 
"name",8,l?  It  determines  whether  or  not  a  program  is  "relocated"  when  it  is  loaded 
into  memory.  If  you  do  not  specify  the  the  C64  will  ignore  the  load  address  at 
the  start  of  the  file  and  load  the  program  starting  at  memory  location  $0801  (2049).  When 
the  is  present,  the  C64  (or  VIC-20)  will  pay  attention  to  the  load  address  and  load 
the  program  into  memory  starting  at  the  location  specified  by  bytes  $02  and  $03. 

The  remaining  sectors,  except  the  last  one,  look  like  this:
