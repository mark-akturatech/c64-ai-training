# ca65 Users Guide - The --relax-checks option: disables certain assembler error checks to allow otherwise rejected code in special cases. Lists the disabled checks: truncation of byte-sized loads from non-zero page addresses instead of error, and allowing indirect jmp (label) when label is on a page boundary ($xxFF) which on 6502 fetches the second byte from the wrong address.

--relax-checks
Disables some error checks done by the assembler. This will allow code that is an error in most cases and flagged as such by the assembler, but can be valid in special situations.

Disabled checks are:

Address vs. fragment size: a byte sized load from an non-zeropage address is truncated instead of producing an error.
Indirect jump on page boundary: jmp (label) on a label that resides on a page boundary ($xxFF) fetches the second byte from the wrong address on 6502 CPUs, now allowed instead of producing an error.
