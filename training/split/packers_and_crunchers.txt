# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Packers (RLE) and crunchers (dictionary-based compressors) for reducing load size and time; recommended tools (PuCrunch for PC/Amiga side crunching), REU usage to speed crunching, linking packing methods vs packing memory areas.

Packers and Crunchers
Before you release something, you want it load as quickly as possible, and to take as little disk space as possible. To achieve this, you use a packer or a cruncher. For the best possible result, you use both.

Packers use run-length encoding (RLE), which is a simple compression technique. What it does is to check for continuous sequences of the same character, and replace those sequences with that character and the count (marked up by a special markup character).

Crunchers are more advanced, slower and give better results, because they use a more advanced algorithm, which checks for common sequences in the data, and replace those by references to earlier identical sequences. If you think crunching takes too long time, try getting an REU (Ram Expansion Unit) and a cruncher that uses it, as that can improve crunching speed a lot.

If you have a means to transfer stuff between your C-64 and a PC or Amiga, you might be interested in checking out Pasi Ojala's PuCrunch, which crunches your C-64 files on the PC or Amiga side. Of course it's very fast, and it also gives very good results.

Some packers (eg. Sledgehammer) let you link all the files that you want to pack. This can be nice, although I prefer the method of saving the whole memory area that I use and pack that. It's a matter of taste, I guess.
