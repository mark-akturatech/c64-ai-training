# ********* - PTR1 ($9E): index used to set up an error log of bytes with parity errors detected on the first pass of tape block transmission (each block sent twice).

158           $9E            PTR1
Tape Pass 1 Error Log Index

This location is used in setting up an error log of bytes in which
transmission parity errors occur the first time that the block is
received (each tape block is sent twice to minimize data loss from
transmission error).
