# Architecture of 6502 Microprocessor - Total addressable memory is 64 Kb. The 6502 is little-endian: 16-bit addresses are stored least-significant byte first (example: $458D stored as $8D $45).


Adressable Memory is therefore	64 Kb

Little endian	Addresses stored least significant byte first.

A 16 bit address needs to be stored in two consecutive bytes.  A little endian processor will store the address $458D as $8D followed by the byte $45.
