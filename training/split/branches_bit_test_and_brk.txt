# 6502 Instruction Set - Branch instruction opcodes and details: BCC, BCS, BEQ (opcodes, bytes, cycles). BIT instruction explanation and opcode forms (zeropage and absolute): A AND M -> affects Z and transfer of M7 to N, M6 to V. BRK behavior (software interrupt): pushes PC+2 and SR with break flag set, cycles and opcodes for BRK. Also BMI/BNE/BPL branch entries and their opcodes. Emphasis on flags and conditional branching timing.

          BRK Force Break
              BRK initiates a software interrupt similar to a hardware
              interrupt (IRQ). The return address pushed to the stack is
              PC+2, providing an extra byte of spacing for a break mark
              (identifying a reason for the break.)
              The status register will be pushed to the stack with the break
              flag set to 1. However, when retrieved during RTI or by a PLP
              instruction, the break flag will be ignored.
              The interrupt disable flag is not set automatically.
