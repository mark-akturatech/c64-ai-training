# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Wrapper at $FFC9 that JMPs ($0320) to open a channel for output (CHKOUT). Sends LISTEN/secondary for serial devices. Returns errors: 3=file not open,5=device not present,7:file not output.

                                *** open channel for output
                                any logical file that has already been opened by the OPEN routine, $FFC0, can be
                                defined as an output channel by this routine the device on the channel must be an
                                output device or an error will occur and the routine will abort.
                                
                                if you are sending data to anywhere other than the screen this routine must be
                                called before using the CHROUT routine, $FFD2. if you are sending data to the
                                screen and no other output channels are open then the calls to this routine and to
                                the OPEN routine, $FFC0, are not needed.
                                
                                when used with a device on the serial bus this routine will automatically send the
                                listen address specified by the OPEN routine, $FFC0, and any secondary address.
                                
                                possible errors are:
                                
                                3 : file not open
                                5 : device not present
                                7 : file is not an output file
