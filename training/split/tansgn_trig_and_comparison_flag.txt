# ********* - TANSGN ($12): stores the sign of TAN or SIN function results (positive/negative). Also reused by string and numeric comparison routines as an outcome indicator: 1 if A>B, 2 if A==B, 4 if A<B; composite values represent combined operators (e.g., >= or <=).

Flag: Sign of the Result of the TAN or SIN Function

This location is used to determine whether the sign of the value
returned by the functions SIN or TAN is positive or negative.

Additionally, the string and numeric comparison routines use this
location to indicate the outcome of the comparison.  For a comparison
of variable A to variable B, the value here will be 1 if A is greater
than B, 2 if A equals B, and 4 if a is less than B.  If more than one
comparison operator was used to compare the two variables (e.g., >= or
<=), the value here will be a combination of the above values.
