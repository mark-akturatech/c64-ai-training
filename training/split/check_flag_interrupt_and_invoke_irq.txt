# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Check VIA1 ICR ($DC0D) for a FLAG interrupt (mask #$10). If a FLAG interrupt is pending, push a crafted return address and jump to the common IRQ-handling entry ($FF43) to save state and execute the IRQ routine; otherwise re-enable interrupts (CLI) and return (RTS).

.,F91A AD 0D DC LDA $DC0D       read VIA 1 ICR
.,F91D 29 10    AND #$10        mask 000x 0000, FLAG interrupt
.,F91F F0 09    BEQ $F92A       if no FLAG interrupt just exit
                                else first call the IRQ routine
.,F921 A9 F9    LDA #$F9        set the return address high byte
.,F923 48       PHA             push the return address high byte
.,F924 A9 2A    LDA #$2A        set the return address low byte
.,F926 48       PHA             push the return address low byte
.,F927 4C 43 FF JMP $FF43       save the status and do the IRQ routine
