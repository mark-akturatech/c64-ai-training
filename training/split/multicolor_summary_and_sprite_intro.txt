# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Summary of multicolor text vs multicolor bitmap (tradeoffs: extra colors vs reduced horizontal resolution) and an introduction to the separate sprite graphics system (independent characters that can be moved and animated).

                          Multicolor text mode offers four colors, three of which will be common
                          to all characters, and one of which can be selected individually.
                          Multicolor bitmap mode offers a choice of four colors, three of which
                          can be individually selected within an 8 by 8 dot area.

                          The 64 also contains an entirely separate graphics system, whose
                          character shapes, colors, and positions are derived and displayed
                          without any reference to the Video Matrix and Character Dot-Data
                          addresses.  Best of all, these characters may be moved quickly and
                          easily to any position on the screen, greatly facilitating games and
                          animated graphics of all types.  This system is known as sprite
