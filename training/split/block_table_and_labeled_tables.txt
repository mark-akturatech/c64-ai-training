# byRiclianll - A region of repeated slot/pointer bytes and short ASCII labels centered on BO: and CO: blocks. Contains many placeholder bytes (AO / OO), scattered values (including '33' and small numerics), and short ASCII fragments such as 'AMO' and an explicit 'RT TABLE' label. This area appears to hold block table entries, table identifiers, and related small metadata for the sector.
