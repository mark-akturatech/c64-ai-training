# MACHINE - Details: IRQ fires ~60Hz on Commodore machines; NMI used for RESTORE and RS-232 (machine-specific); BRK behaves like IRQ but sets B flag. ROM interrupt code typically pushes A/X/Y/etc for ISR preservation. Understand stack contents during interrupt (PC and SR) differ from JSR/RTS stored address (no '-1').


Note that the address on the stack is the return address.  This differs from
JSR/RTS, where the return address minus one is stored.

On all Commodore machines, the IRQ strikes about sixty times a second.  The
NMI is unused (but available) on PET/CBM; it isn't available in the 264
series; and on the VIC-20 and Commodore 64, it is used for the RESTORE key
and for RS-232 communications.

                                                                        :116:

The BRK command can be distinguished from the IRQ signal by means of a bit in
the status register.  Bit 4 is the B, or break flag; if it's set, the last
interrupt was caused by a BRK and not by an IRQ.

Later, we will discuss using the interrupt routines for our own programming.
By the time we can "catch" the interrupt, several more things will have been
pushed to the stack:  the A, X, and Y registers.  This is done by a ROM
program, not the processor; but it will prove handy since we can use these
registers, safe in the knowledge that they will be restored at the end of the
interrupt.
