# Kick Assembler - Usage examples for the 16-bit pseudo commands (inc16, mov16, add16) showing calls with labels, immediate values, and zeropage forms. Note explaining that when the target argument is omitted add16 receives an argument of type AT_NONE and will use the first argument as the target. Concluding remark about using pseudo commands to create extended instruction libraries to simplify common programming tasks.


You can use these like this:
inc16 counter
mov16 #irq1 : $0314
mov16 #startAddress : $30
add16 $30 : #128
add16 $30 : #$1000: $32

Note how the target argument of the add16 command can be left out. When this is the case an argument with
type AT_NONE is passed to the pseudo command and the first argument is then used as target.
With the pseudo command directive you can define your own extended instruction libraries, which can speed
up some of the more trivial tasks of programming.
