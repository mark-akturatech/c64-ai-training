# Datassette Encoding - High-level explanation of Commodore Datassette encoding: uses pulse-length encoding (each pulse is one full HIGH+LOW cycle) rather than FSK; pulses represent magnetic tape waveform cycles.


Overview
--------

The Commodore Datassette uses pulse length encoding rather than frequency-shift
keying to record data on magnetic tape. Each pulse represents one complete
frequency cycle of HIGH and LOW levels.
