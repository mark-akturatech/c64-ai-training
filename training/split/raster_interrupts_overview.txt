# Contents - What raster interrupts are and why they're used: the VIC-II can generate an interrupt on any specified scan line (a raster interrupt), allowing an interrupt routine to gain the CPU at a specific point on the screen for mid-frame changes (for example, changing background color).

microprocessor time. For instance, if you want to 
change the background color at a certain point on 
the screen, you need to use an interrupt. The VIC 
II chip can generate an interrupt on any scan line 
that you specify. This type of interrupt is called a 
raster interrupt. By using raster interrupts, your in-

terrupt routine can gain access to the processor at 
a specific (relatively) point on the screen.
