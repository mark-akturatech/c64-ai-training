# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $DC02-$DC03 — CIA #1 Data Direction Registers A and B: control direction (input=0/output=1) for each bit of Data Ports A and B respectively. Default: DDRA=255 (all outputs), DDRB=0 (all inputs) for keyboard scanning mode.

$DC02-$DC03               CIA #1 Data Direction Registers A and B

                          These Data Direction Registers control the direction of data flow over
                          Data Ports A and B.  Each bit controls the direction of the data on
                          the corresponding bit of the port.  If the bit of the Direction
                          Register is set to a 1, the corresponding Data Port bit will be used
                          for data output.  If the bit is set to a 0, the corresponding Data
                          Port bit will be used for data input.  For example, Bit 7 of Data
                          Direction Register A controls Bit 7 of Data Port A, and if that
                          direction bit is set to 0, Bit 7 of Data Port A will be used for data
                          input.  If the direction bit is set to 1, however, data Bit 7 on Port
                          A will be used for data output.

                          The default setting for Data Direction Register A is 255 (all
                          outputs), and for Data Direction Register B it is 0 (all inputs).
                          This corresponds to the setting used when reading the keyboard (the
                          keyboard column number is written to Data Port A, and the row number
                          is then read in Data Port B).
