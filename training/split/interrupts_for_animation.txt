# Contents - Why you need interrupts in games: if the main program performs lengthy calculations or is busy, periodic interrupts are required to maintain smooth animation (take control at least once every other screen) to avoid jerky motion.


Interrupts are useful when the main program 
involves lengthy calculations or is going to be busy 
for quite some time. If you are trying to maintain 
animation while the main program is running, you 
need to use some form of interrupt to take control 
at least once every other screen. Otherwise, the 
animation will appear jerky.
