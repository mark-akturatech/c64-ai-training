# ********* - Main IRQ/BRK entry at $FF48 (65352); hardware IRQ/BRK vector at $FFFE (65534) points here. Saves A/X/Y on stack, tests BRK bit of status (.P) to determine BRK vs IRQ. If BRK, exits through RAM BRK vector at $0316 (790). Otherwise exits through RAM IRQ vector at $0314 (788), typically to keyboard-scan handler at $EA31 (59953). When installing custom handlers into these vectors, ensure saved registers are pulled from stack before returning.

Main IRQ/BRK Interrupt Entry Point

The 6510 hardware IRQ/BRK vector at 65534 ($FFFE) points to this
address.

Anytime the BRK instruction is encountered or an IRQ interrupt occurs,
this routine will be executed.  The routine first saves the .A, .X,
and .Y registers on the stack, and then tests the BRK bit of the
status register (.P) to see if a BRK was executed.  If it was, the
routine exits through the RAM BRK vector at 790 ($316), where it will
usually be directed to the BRK routine at 65126 ($FE66).  If not, the
routine exits through the RAM IRQ vector at 788 ($314), where it will
usually be directed to the handler that scans the keyboard at 59953
($EA31).

If you plan to change either of these vectors to your own routine,
remember to pull the stored register values off the stack before
finishing.
