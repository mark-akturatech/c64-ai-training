# COMMODORE 64 - ON <variable> GOTO/GOSUB line1,line2,...: jumps to one of listed lines depending on integer value of variable (fraction truncated). If value zero or out of range, statement ignored. Negative variable yields ?ILLEGAL QUANTITY. Shows examples where ON replaces multiple IF...THENs.

  ON

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: ON <variable> GOTO / GOSUB <line-number>[,<line-number>]...

    Action: The ON statement is used to GOTO one of several given line-
  numbers, depending upon the value of a variable. The value of the
  variables can range from zero through the number of lines given. if the
  value is a non-integer, the fractional portion is left off. For example,
  if the variable value is 3, ON will GOTO the third line-number in the
  list.
    If the value of the variable is negative, the BASIC error message
  ?ILLEGAL QUANTITY occurs. If the number is zero, or greater than the
  number of items in the list, the program just "ignores" the statement and
  continues with the statement following the ON statement.
    ON is really an underused variant of the IF...THEN...statement. Instead
  of using a whole lot of IF statements each of which sends the program to
  1 specific line, 1 ON statement can replace a list of IF statements. When
  you look at the first example you should notice that the 1 ON statement
  replaces 4 IF...THEN... statements.

    EXAMPLES of ON Statement:

  ON -(A=7)-2*(A=3)-3*(A<3)-4*(A>7)GOTO 400,900,1000,100
  ON X GOTO 100,130,180,220
  ON X+3 GOSUB 9000,20,9000
  100 ON NUM GOTO 150,300,320,390
  500 ON SUM/2 + 1 GOSUB 50,80,20
