# Contents - Notes on changing the video base (VIDBAS) register values and how they affect text and graphics base addresses. Covers: where to find values (Table 7-2), which bits to change for TEXT (upper bits) vs graphics (lower bits), meaning of a dash (don't care), and the need to add the BASE address register to the listed addresses to obtain the real memory address.

want to change the base address of the registers 
yourself, the values to use can be found in Table 7-2. 
When changing a value for the TEXT mode, only 
the upper bits should be changed in the VIDBAS 
register. Similarly, when changing a graphics base 
address, only the lower bits should be changed. A 
dash indicates a don't care condition. You must 
remember to add the BASE address register to the 
addresses to find the real address.
