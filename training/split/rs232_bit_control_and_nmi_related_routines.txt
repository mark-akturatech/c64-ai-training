# ********* - RS-232 line-control subroutines: routines to set serial clock line low/high (61061 $EE85, 61070 $EE8E), set serial data output low (61079 $EE97), read serial bus data and clock bits into processor flags (61097 $EEA9). 1 msec delay, NMI-driven RS-232 send/receive bit routines (61107 $EEB3, 61115 $EEBB), RS-232 error handler (61230 $EF2E), set word length for RS-232 characters (61258 $#F4A), and NMI handlers to receive/send RS-232 bits (61273 $EF59 and 61273+).

the location 53272 ($D018) accordingly.

60510         $EC5E
Set Flag to Enable or Disable Switching Character Sets

This subroutine is also used to check for special characters to print.
In this case, it checks for the characters that enable or disable the
SHIFT/logo combination from toggling the character set currently in
use (CHR$(8) and CHR$(9)).  If one of these is to be printed, the flag
at 657 ($291) is changed.

Control Keyboard Matrix Decode Table

This table contains the 64 PETASCII values for the Control keyboard,
one for each key which is struck while the CTRL key is pressed.  The
table is in keycode order (see the keycode table in Appendix H for the
correspondence of keycode to key).  A 65th byte with the value of 255
($FF) marks the end of the table (this corresponds to a keypress value
of 64, no key pressed).

The only keys generally struck in combination with the CTRL key are
the ones that change the colors on the top row of the keyboard, but
this doesn't necessarily mean that the other CTRL key combinations
don't do anything.  On the contrary, looking at the values in this
table, you can see that any of the first 32 values in the PETASCII
table can be produced by some combination of the CTRL key and another
key.  CTRL-@ produces a CHR$(0).  CTRL-A through CTRL-Z produce
CHR$(1) through CHR$(26).  Ctrl-: is the same as CHR$(27), CTRL-Lira
(that's the slashed-L British pound sign) produces CHR$(28), CTRL-;
equals CHR$(29), CTRL-up arrow produces CHR$(30), and CTRL-= produces
CHR$(31).

Any of these combinations produce the same effect as the CHR$(X)
statement.  For examble, CTRL-; moves the cursor over to the right,
CTRL-N switches to lowercase, CTRL-R turns on reverse video, and
CTRL-E changes the printing to white.

Video Chip Register Default Table

This table contains the default values that are stored in the 47
VIC-II chip registers.  It is interesting to note that this table
appears to be incomplete.  While Sprite Color Registers 0-6 are
initialized to values of 1-7, Sprite Color Register 7 is initialized
to 76--the ASCII value of the letter L which begins on the next table.

60647         $ECE7
Text for Keyboard Buffer When SHIFT/RUN is Pressed

When the SHIFT and RUN keys are pressed, the ASCII text stored here is
forced into the keyboard buffer.  That text is LOAD, carriage return,
RUN, carriage return.

60656         $ECF0
Low Byte Table of Screen Line Addresses

This table holds the low byte of the screen address for lines 0-24.
The high byte is derived from combining a value from the screen line
link table at 217 ($D9) with the pointer to screen memory at 648
($288).

60681         $ED09          TALK
Send TALK to a Device on the Serial Bus

This is a documented Kernal routine whose entry in the jump table is
65460 ($FFB4).  When called, it ORs the device number in the
Accumulator with the TALK code (64, $40) and sends it on the serial
bus.  This commands the device to TALK.

60684         $ED0C          LISTEN

This is a documented Kernal routine whose entry in the jump table is
65457 ($FFB1).  When called, it ORs the device number in the
Accumulator with the LISTEN code (32, $20) and sends it on the serial
bus.  This commands the device to LISTEN.

60689         $ED11
Send Command Code to a Device on the Serial Bus

This subroutine is used in common by many Kernal routines to send the
command code in the Accumulator to a device on the serial bus.

60736         $ED40
Send a Byte on the Serial Bus

This subroutine is used in common by several Kernal routines to send
the byte in the serial bus character buffer at 149 ($95) on the serial
bus.

60848         $EDB0
Time-Out Error on Serial Bus

This subroutine handles the case when the device does not respond by
setting the DEVICE NOT PRESENT error code and exiting.

60857         $EDB9          SECOND
Send a Secondary Address to a Device on the Serial Bus after LISTEN

This is a documented Kernal routine that can be entered from the jump
