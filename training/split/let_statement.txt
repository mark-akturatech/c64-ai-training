# COMMODORE 64 - LET <variable> = <expression> (LET optional): assigns value to variable; LET keyword is optional and often omitted to save memory. Examples showing LET with numeric and string assignments and concatenation.

  LET

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: [LET] <variable> = <expression>

    Action: The LET statement can be used to assign a value to a variable.
  But the word LET is optional and therefore most advanced programmers
  leave LET out because it's always understood and wastes valuable memory.
  The equal sign (=) alone is sufficient when assigning the value of an
  expression to a variable name.

  EXAMPLES of LET Statement:

    10 LET D= 12              (This is the same as D = 12)
    20 LET E$ = "ABC"
    30 F$ = "WORDS"
    40 SUM$= E$ + F$          (SUM$ would equal ABCWORDS)
