    The Operating System gives you two modes of BASIC operation:

    1) DIRECT Mode
    2) PROGRAM Mode

    1) When you're using the DIRECT mode, BASIC statements don't have
       line numbers in front of the statement. They are executed whenever
       the <RETURN> key is pressed.
    2) The PROGRAM mode is the one you use for running programs.



                                                BASIC PROGRAMMING RULES   3
~


       When using the PROGRAM mode, all of your BASIC statements must have
       line numbers in front of them. You can have more than one BASIC
       statement in a line of your program, but the number of statements is
       limited by the fact that you can only put 80 characters on a logical
       screen line. This means that if you are going to go over the 80
       character limit you have to put the entire BASIC statement that
       doesn't fit on a new line with a new line number.

         Always type NEW and hit <RETURN> before starting a new program.

    The Commodore 64 has two complete character sets that you can use
  either from the keyboard or in your programs.
    In SET 1, the upper case alphabet and the numbers 0-9 are available
  without pressing the <SHIFT> key. If you hold down the <SHIFT> key
  while typing, the graphics characters on the RIGHT side of the front of
  the keys are used. If you hold down the <C=> key while typing, the
  graphics characters on the LEFT side of the front of the key are used.
  Holding down the <SHIFT> key while typing any character that doesn't
  have graphic symbols on the front of the key gives you the symbol on the
  top most part of the key.
    In SET 2, the lower case alphabet and the numbers 0-9 are available
  without pressing the <SHIFT> key. The upper case alphabet is available
  when you hold down the <SHIFT> key while typing. Again, the graphic
  symbols on the LEFT side of the front of the keys are displayed by press-
  ing the <C=> key, while the symbols on the top most part of any key
  without graphics characters are selected when you hold down the <SHIFT>
  key while typing.
    To switch from one character set to the other press the <C=> and
  the <SHIFT> keys together.

  PROGRAMMING NUMBERS AND VARIABLES

  INTEGER, FLOATING-POINT AND STRING CONSTANTS

    Constants are the data values that you put in your BASIC statements.
  BASIC uses these values to represent data during statement execution.
  CBM BASIC can recognize and manipulate three types of constants:

    1) INTEGER NUMBERS
    2) FLOATING-POINT NUMBERS
    3) STRINGS


  4   BASIC PROGRAMMING RULES

    Integer constants are whole numbers (numbers without decimal points).
  Integer constants must be between -32768 and +32767. Integer constants
  do not have decimal points or commas between digits. If the plus (+) sign
  is left out, the constant is assumed to be a positive number. Zeros
  coming before a constant are ignored and shouldn't be used since they
  waste memory and slow down your program. However, they won't cause an
  error. Integers are stored in memory as two-byte binary numbers. Some
  examples of integer constants are:

                               -12
                              8765
                            -32768
                               +44
                                 0
                            -32767
  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
  |  NOTE: Do NOT put commas inside any number. For example, always type  |
  |  32,000 as 32000. If you put a comma in the middle of a number you    |
  | will get the BASIC error message ?SYNTAX ERROR.                       |
  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

    Floating-point constants are positive or negative numbers and can
  contain fractions. Fractional parts of a number may be shown using a
  decimal point. Once again remember that commas are NOT used between
  numbers. If the plus sign (+) is left off the front of a number, the
  Commodore 64 assumes that the number is positive. If you leave off the
  decimal point the computer will assume that it follows the last digit of
  the number. And as with integers, zeros that come before a constant
  are ignored. Floating-point constants can be used in two ways:

    1) SIMPLE NUMBER
    2) SCIENTIFIC NOTATION

    Floating-point constants will show you up to nine digits on your
  screen. These digits can represent values between -999999999. and
  +999999999. If you enter more than nine digits the number will be
  rounded based on the tenth digit. if the tenth digit is greater than or
  equal to 5 the number will be rounded upward. Less than 5 the number
  be rounded downward. This could be important to the final totals of
  some numbers you may want to work with.
    Floating-point numbers are stored (using five bytes of memory) and
  are manipulated in calculations with ten places of accuracy. However,

                                                BASIC PROGRAMMING RULES   5

  the numbers are rounded to nine digits when results are printed. Some
  examples of simple floating-point numbers are:

                  1.23                 .7777777
                  -.998877         -333.
                 +3.1459               .01


    Numbers smaller than .01 or larger than 999999999. will be printed in
  scientific notation. In scientific notation a floating-point constant is
  made up of three parts:

    1) THE MANTISSA
    2) THE LETTER E
    3) THE EXPONENT

    The mantissa is a simple floating-point number. The letter E is used to
  tell you that you're seeing the number in exponential form. In other
  words E represents * 10 (eg., 3E3 = 3*10^3 = 3000). And the exponent is
  what multiplication power of 10 the number is raised to.
    Both the mantissa and the exponent are signed (+ or -) numbers. The
  exponent's range is from -39 to +38 and it indicates the number of places
  that the actual decimal point in the mantissa would be moved to the left
  (-) or right (+) if the value of the constant were represented as a
  simple number.
    There is a limit to the size of floating-point numbers that BASIC can
  handle, even in scientific notation: the largest number is
  +1.70141183E+38 and calculations which would result in a larger number
  will display the BASIC error message ?OVERFLOW ERROR. The smallest
  floating-point number is +2.93873588E-39 and calculations which result
  in a smaller value give you zero as an answer and NO error message. Some
  examples of floating-point numbers in scientific notation (and their
  decimal values) are:

 	235.988E-3	(.235988)
        2359E6          (2359000000.)
        -7.09E-12       (-.00000000000709)
	-3.14159E+5	(-314159.)

    String constants are groups of alphanumeric information like letters,
  numbers and symbols. When you enter a string from the keyboard, it
  can have any length up to the space available in an 80-character line
