# NMOS 6510 - Detailed code sequences for opcode variants 8 and 9. Covers: 8 (orange) — implied sequence using TAY then LDY #<bg>, STY $D021, plus NOPs; 9 (brown) — LDA #<bg>, STA $D021, NOPs. Includes the opcode bytes, the small 10-cycle tail structure, and the placement of NOPs to pad timing. Also includes surrounding page markers and spacing from the original listing. These variants continue the technique of selecting the opcode written immediately after the $D011 store to choose the open-bus colour.
