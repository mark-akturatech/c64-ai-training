# Contents - Names and detailed descriptions of the per-voice SID registers used by the Sound Editor. Lists registers for voice #1 as example: V1ATDC (Attack/Decay nibbles), V1SURL (Sustain/Release nibbles), V1FRLO and V1FRHI (low/high bytes of 16-bit frequency), V1PWLO and V1PWHI (12-bit pulse width split across low byte and upper nibble), and V1CORG (control register: waveform, sync, enable).

worth of notes is provided in the COMMON file, tion, wherever all three voices have identical 
:. fisting C-7 in Appendix C. In the following descrip- registers, voice #1 is used as an example. 



V1ATDC 

V1SURL 

V1FRLO 
V1FRHI 

V 1 PWhO 

V1PWHI 
V 1C0RG

The high nibble controls the attack time for this channel; the low nibble controls the 
decay time. 

The high nibble controls the sustain level for the channel; the low nibble controls the 
release time. 

This is the low order 8 bits of a 16 bit value that specifies a frequency for the channel. 
This is the high order 8 bits of a 16 bit value that specifies a frequency for the channel. 
This is the low order 8 bits of a 12 bit value that specifies the pulse width of the chan- 
nel when you are generating a square wave. 

The lower nibble of this register contains the high order 4 bits of a 12 bit value that 
specifies a pulse width of the channel when generating a square wave. 
This register is the control register for the sound channel. It controls the type of 
waveform as well as the synchronization mode. The enable bit for the channel is in 
this register.
