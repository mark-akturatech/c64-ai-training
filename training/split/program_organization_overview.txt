# Contents - Recommended program structure: macro library, system definitions (hardware registers), RAM definitions, data definitions, main program, subroutines. Macros must be defined before use; macros and system definition files referenced (MACLIB, SYSDEF).

Chapter 5 
Organizing Your Program 



Now that you have some understanding of what an 
assembler does and of the 6510 assembly language, 
you can begin to think about how to organize your 
program. All programs can be broken down as 

follows: 

• Macro library 

• System definitions 

• RAM definitions 

• Data definitions 

• Main program 

• Subroutines 

Although it may not be obvious at this point, this 
is a very logical outline. The macro library must be 
assembled first. Quite often there will be macros 
that define data areas. A macro must be defined 
prior to its first use. There is no penalty in terms
