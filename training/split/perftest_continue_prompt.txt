# ********* - User 'continue (y/n)?' prompt routine: prints the prompt, flushes keyboard buffer (FOR loop), waits for a non-empty keypress, echoes the key and branches: 'n' ends the program, 'y' returns to caller, otherwise loops back to prompt (GOTO). This routine is called by other parts of the program to ask the operator whether to continue.
