# A Minimal C64 Datasette Program Loader - get_block routine: reads a specified number of bytes into memory via an indirect pointer (STA (ptr),Y), decrementing a count and incrementing Y. Returns early with the carry flag set if an end-of-data marker is detected (via get_byte returning carry). Uses JSR get_byte and STA (ptr),Y to store data.

Data Block Reading
------------------

    get_block:
        sta count
        ldy #0
    g1: jsr get_byte
        bcs g2
        sta (ptr),y
        iny
        dec count
        bne g1
    g2: rts

This reads a specified number of bytes into memory at a given address,
returning early with carry set if an end-of-data marker is encountered.
