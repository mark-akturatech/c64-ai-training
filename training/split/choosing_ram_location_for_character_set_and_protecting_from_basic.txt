# COMMODORE 64 - Gives safe starting positions for RAM-based character sets: avoid $0000 and $0800 (0 and 2048). Recommends $3000 (12288) for experiments and shows how to set the low 4 bits of 53272 to 12: POKE 53272,(PEEK(53272)AND240)+12. Shows how to reduce BASIC's available memory (POKE 52148:POKE56,48:CLR) so BASIC won't overwrite the character RAM, and how to check free memory with PRINT FRE(0)-(SGN(FRE(0))<0)*65535.

    There are two locations in the Commodore 64 to start your character set
  that should NOT be used with BASIC: location 0 and location 2048. The
  first should not be used because the system stores important data on
  page 0. The second can't be used because that is where your BASIC program
  starts! However, there are 6 other starting positions for your custom
  character set.
    The best place to put your character set for use with BASIC while
  experimenting is beginning at 12288 ($3000 in HEX). This is done by
  POKEing the low 4 bits of location 53272 with 12. Try the POKE now, like
  this:

    POKE 53272,(PEEK(53272)AND240)+12

    Immediately, all the letters on the screen turn to garbage, This is
  because there are no characters set up at location 12288 right now...
  only random bytes. Set the Commodore 64 back to normal by hitting the
  <RUN/STOP> key and then the <RESTORE> key.
    Now let's begin creating graphics characters. To protect your char-
  acter set from BASIC, you should reduce the amount of memory BASIC
  thinks it has. The amount of memory in your computer stays the same...
  it's just that you've told BASIC not to use some of it. Type:

    PRINT FRE(0)-(SGN(FRE(0))<0)*65535

    The number displayed is the amount of memory space left unused. Now
  type the following:

    POKE 52148:POKE56,48:CLR
