# COMMODORE 64 - KERNAL LOAD (call $FFD5 / 65493): load RAM from an input device or verify device data against memory. Uses A (0=LOAD, 1=VERIFY), X,Y for start/end addresses when secondary address=0 (relocated loads). Requires SETLFS and SETNAM preparatory calls. Returns highest RAM location loaded. Error returns: 0,4,5,8,9 and READST. Example demonstrates loading from tape with SETLFS/SETNAM and JSR LOAD.

  B-15. Function Name: LOAD

    Purpose: Load RAM from device
    Call address: $FFD5 (hex) 65493 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A, X, Y
    Preparatory routines: SETLFS, SETNAM
    Error returns: 0,4,5,8,9, READST
    Stack requirements: None
    Registers affected: A, X, Y

    Description: This routine LOADs data bytes from any input device di-
  rectly into the memory of the Commodore 64. It can also be used for a
  verify operation, comparing data from a device with the data already in
  memory, while leaving the data stored in RAM unchanged.
    The accumulator (.A) must be set to 0 for a LOAD operation, or 1 for a
  verify, If the input device is OPENed with a secondary address (SA) of 0
  the header information from the device is ignored. In this case, the X
  and Y registers must contain the starting address for the load. If the
  device is addressed with a secondary address of 1, then the data is
  loaded into memory starting at the location specified by the header. This
  routine returns the address of the highest RAM location loaded.
    Before this routine can be called, the KERNAL SETLFS, and SETNAM
  routines must be called.

  | NOTE: You can NOT LOAD from the keyboard (0), RS-232 (2), or the      |
  | screen (3).                                                           |

  How to Use:

    0) Call the SETLFS, and SETNAM routines. If a relocated load is de-
       sired, use the SETLFS routine to send a secondary address of 0.
    1) Set the A register to 0 for load, 1 for verify.
    2) If a relocated load is desired, the X and Y registers must be set
       to the start address for the load.
    3) Call the routine using the JSR instruction.

  EXAMPLE:

          ;LOAD   A FILE FROM TAPE

           LDA #DEVICE1        ;SET DEVICE NUMBER
           LDX #FILENO         ;SET LOGICAL FILE NUMBER
           LDY CMD1            ;SET SECONDARY ADDRESS
           JSR SETLFS
           LDA #NAME1-NAME     ;LOAD A WITH NUMBER OF
                               ;CHARACTERS IN FILE NAME
           LDX #<NAME          ;LOAD X AND Y WITH ADDRESS OF
           LDY #>NAME          ;FILE NAME
           JSR SETNAM
           LDA #0              ;SET FLAG FOR A LOAD
           LDX #$FF            ;ALTERNATE START
           LDY #$FF
           JSR LOAD
           STX VARTAB          ;END OF LOAD
           STY VARTA B+1
           JMP START
   NAME    .BYT 'FILE NAME'
   NAME1                       ;
