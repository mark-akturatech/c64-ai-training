# COMMODORE 64 - DATA <list of constants>: stores literal data in program lines for later consumption by READ statements. DATA lines are not executed; treated as continuous list from lowest to highest line number. Strings containing commas, colons, blanks must be quoted. Examples given for numeric and string DATA entries.



  DATA

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: DATA <list of constants>

    Action: DATA statements store information within a program. The program
  uses the information by means of the READ statement, which pulls
  successive constants from the DATA statements.
    The DATA statements don't have to be executed by the program, they
  only have to be present. Therefore, they are usually placed at the end of
  the program.
    All data statements in a program are treated as a continuous list. Data
  is READ from left to right, from the lowest numbered line to the highest.
  If the READ statement encounters data that doesn't fit the type requested
  (if it needs a number and finds a string) an error message occurs.
