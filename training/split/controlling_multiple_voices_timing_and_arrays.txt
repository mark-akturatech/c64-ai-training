# COMMODORE 64 - Techniques for coordinating multiple voices: divide measures into 16 parts, store events per 1/16th in separate arrays for each voice, compute high and low frequency bytes, and use waveform control bytes to gate notes on/off. Explains how activity arrays allow synchronized playback of multiple voices and how to reuse base frequencies and division by 2 for octaves.

  CONTROLLING MULTIPLE VOICES

    Once you have gotten used to using more than one voice, you will find
  that the timing of the three voices needs to be coordinated. This is ac-
  complished in this program by:

    1) Divide each musical measure into 16 parts.
    2) Store the events that occur in each 1/16th measure interval in three
       separate arrays.

    The high and low frequency bytes are calculated by dividing the fre-
  quencies of the highest octave by two (lines 180 and 190). The waveform
  control byte is a start signal for beginning a note or continuing a note
  that is already playing. It is a stop signal to end a note. The waveform
  choice is made once for each voice in line 40.
    Again, this is only one way to control multiple voices. You may come
  up with your own methods. However, you should now be able to take any
  piece of sheet music and figure out the notes for all three voices.
