# MACHINE - Notes about B128 variant of PENTOMINOS: does not align to the same addresses; illustrates the B128 'boot' loading system. Files whose names begin with '+' are loaded by the bootstrap program and should not be loaded directly.

The B128 version does not align to the above addresses.  It is written to
illustrate the "boot" loading system needed for that computer.  Programs
whose name begin with a + symbol are loaded by the bootstrap program; do not
try to load them directly.
