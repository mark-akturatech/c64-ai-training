# COMMODORE 64 - Introduction to bit mapping (high-resolution graphics): assigns one bit per pixel for 320x200 resolution (8K bytes for full bitmap: 320*200/8 = 8000 bytes). Notes drawbacks: memory use and slower BASIC performance; recommends machine language or VSP cartridge for speed. Introduces standard and multi-color bit map modes.

  BIT MAPPED GRAPHICS

    When writing games, plotting charts for business applications, or other
  types of programs, sooner or later you get to the point where you want
  high-resolution displays.
    The Commodore 64 has been designed to do just that: high resolution is
  available through bit mapping of the screen. Bit mapping is the method in
  which each possible dot (pixel) of resolution on the screen is assigned
  its own bit (location) in memory. If that memory bit is a one, the dot it
  is assigned to is on. If the bit is set to zero, the dot is off.
    High-resolution graphic design has a couple of drawbacks, which is why
  it is not used all the time. First of all, it takes lots of memory to bit
  map the entire screen. This is because every pixel must have a memory bit
  to control it. You are going to need one bit of memory for each pixel
  (or one byte for 8 pixels). Since each character is 8 by 8, and there are
  40 lines with 25 characters in each line, the resolution is 320 pixels
  (dots) by 200 pixels for the whole screen. That gives you 64000 separate
  dots, each of which requires a bit in memory. In other words, 8000 bytes
  of memory are needed to map the whole screen.
    Generally, high-resolution operations are made of many short, simple,
  repetitive routines. Unfortunately, this kind of thing is usually rather
  slow if you are trying to write high-resolution routines in BASIC. How-
  ever, short, simple, repetitive routines are exactly what machine lan-
  guage does best. The solution is to either write your programs entirely
  in machine language, or call machine language, high-resolution sub-
  routines from your BASIC program using the SYS command from BASIC. That
  way you get both the ease of writing in BASIC, and the speed of machine
  language for graphics. The VSP cartridge is also available to add high-
  resolution commands to COMMODORE 64 BASIC.
    All of the examples given in this section will be in BASIC to make them
  clear. Now to the technical details.

    BIT MAPPING is one of the most popular graphics techniques in the
  computer world. It is used to create highly detailed pictures. Basically,
  when the Commodore 64 goes into bit map mode, it directly displays an
