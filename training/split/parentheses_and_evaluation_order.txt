# Kick Assembler - Section 4.5: Use of soft parentheses () and hard brackets [] to control order of evaluation; differences between soft parentheses as indirect addressing in 65xx assembly (jmp ($1000)) vs hard brackets for grouping; nesting parentheses examples.

4.5. Parentheses
You can use both soft parentheses () and har parentheses [] to tell the order of evaluation.
lda #2+5*2
lda #(2+5)*2
lda #[2+5]*2

// gives lda #12
// gives lda #14
// gives lda #14

Note that 65xx assemblers use soft parenthesis to signal an indirect addressing mode:
jmp ($1000)
jmp [$1000]

// Creates a jmp indirect command
// Creates a jmp absolute command

You can nest as many parentheses as you want, so (([((2+4))])*3)+25.5 is a legal expression.
