# ********* - STRLIT: scans a string literal to determine its length, calls the memory allocation routine to reserve space, then either saves the string into string storage or creates a pointer to the string in the BASIC input text buffer (at $200 / 512).

Scan and Set Up Pointers to a String in Memory

This routine calculates the length of the string, and calls the
routine that allocates space in memory.  It then saves the string, or
creates a pointer to its location in the BASIC text input buffer at
512 ($200).
