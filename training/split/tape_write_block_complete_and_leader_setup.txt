# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Handles the end-of-block completion and post-block setup. Decrements copies count ($BE); if more copies remain it continues, otherwise it stops the cassette motor (JSR $FCCA). Sets the tape-write leader count ($A7 = #$50), prepares the leader-vector index (LDX #$08), disables interrupts (SEI) and sets the tape vector (JSR $FCBD) before the final branch back to restore/exit.
