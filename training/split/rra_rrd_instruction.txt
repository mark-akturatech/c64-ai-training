# NMOS 6510 - Undocumented RRA (also shown as RRD) instruction family — a combination instruction that performs ROR on memory followed by ADC into A with the same addressing mode. Covers the instruction type, sample opcodes and mnemonics for zero page, zero page,X, (zp,X), (zp),Y, and absolute addressing modes ($67 RRA zp, $77 RRA zp,X, $63 RRA (zp,X), $73 RRA (zp),Y, $6F RRA abs). Includes the function semantics ({addr} = ROR {addr} then A = A ADC {addr}), and the table entries for byte size, cycle counts, and affected flags (status flags layout).
