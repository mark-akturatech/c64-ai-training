# Contents - Describes bit ordering (spread horizontally), defines the least significant bit (LSB) on the right and most significant bit (MSB) on the left. Explains that each bit position has a value 2^N where N is the number of bits from the LSB, gives the LSB example (N=0 => value 1) and next bit (2^1), and explains how to compute a group's numeric value by summing the values of ON bits, using a nibble's max (15) as an example.

in the group. Spreading the bits out horizontally, the 
bit on the right is called the least significant bit 
(LSB). The bit on the left is called the most signifi- 
cant bit (MSB). The location of each bit in the byte 
is given a value of 2 A N, where N is the number of 
bits from the LSB that the location in question is. 
For instance the LSB is located on itself so its 
distance (N) would be O. Therefore, the LSB can 
have a value of or 1 depending on the state of its 
bit. The next bit on the left would have a value of 
2 A 1. 

The group of four bits could have sixteen values, 
through 15, as you have seen. As discussed earlier, 
the value of the bit depends on its location in the 
group and its state. To compute the value of the 
group of bits, you simply add together the value of 
each location in the group whose corresponding bit 
is ON. By summing the total of all of the positions 
in a group, the maximum value of a group can be 
determined. In the case of a nibble, the maximum 
value would be 15.
