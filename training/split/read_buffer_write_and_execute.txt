# byRiclianll - Read, assemble and transfer buffer to the drive, then execute: REM READ section sets JOB=128 and GOSUB 570 to read the sector(s), nested FOR loops collect bytes into buffer variables (D*(J) ...), then a sequence of PRINT#15 'M-W' commands streams the assembled data to the drive memory (block writes), followed by the execute sequence (M-W to write the execute vector and M-R to request execution), GET#15 to read execution response, checks on response bytes (including ASC/E checks), CLOSE 15, and final program DONE/END. This chunk performs the data upload of the destructive routine and triggers its execution on the drive.
