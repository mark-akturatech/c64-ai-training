# COMMODORE 64 - Explains per-MOB priority control relative to character and bitmap display data using MnDP bits in register 27 ($1B). Shows priority meanings: MnDP=0 — non-transparent MOB data displayed in front of character/bitmap (MOB in front); MnDP=1 — non-transparent MOB data displayed only instead of Background #0 or multi-color bit pair 01 (MOB behind). Includes a small priority matrix and notes that MOB data bits of '0' (or '00' in multi-color) are transparent. Describes fixed MOB-to-MOB priority (MOB 0 highest, MOB 7 lowest) and that MOB-vs-MOB priority is resolved before MOB vs. character/bitmap priority.

  PRIORITY

    The priority of each MOB may be individually controlled with respect to
  the other displayed information from character or bit map modes. The
  priority of each MOB is set by the corresponding bit (MnDP) of register
  27 ($1B) as follows:

     REG BIT  |          PRIORITY TO CHARACTER OR BIT MAP DATA
  ------------+------------------------------------------------------------
        0     |  Non-transparent MOB data will be displayed (MOB in front)
        1     |  Non-transparent MOB data will be displayed only instead of
              |  Bkgd #0 or multi-color bit pair 01 (MOB behind)


                          MOB-DISPLAY DATA PRIORITY
                       +--------------+--------------+
                       |   MnDP = 1   |   MnDP = 0   |
                       +--------------+--------------+

                       |  Foreground  |  MOBn        |
                       |  Background  |  Background  |

  MOB data bits of "0" ("00" in multi-color mode) are transparent, always
  permitting any other information to be displayed.
    The MOBs have a fixed priority with respect to each other, with MOB 0
  having the highest priority and MOB 7 the lowest. When MOB data (except
  transparent data) of two MOBs are coincident, the data from the lower
  number MOB will be displayed. MOB vs. MOB data is prioritized before
  priority resolution with character or bit map data.
