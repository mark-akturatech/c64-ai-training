# 6502 Multiplication and Division Algorithms - Source: llx.com - Explains that multiplying by 4, 8, 16, ... is done by repeating the multiply-by-2 operation. Shows example code for multiplying a one-byte value by 4 and a two-byte value by repeated ASL/ROL operations.



Multiplying by 4, 8, 16, or higher powers of two is simply a matter
of multiplying by two enough times to get the result.  For example, to
multiply a one-bye number by four:


ASL NUM
        ASL NUM


Or for two-byte numbers:


ASL NUM
        ROL NUM+1
        ASL NUM
        ROL NUM+1
