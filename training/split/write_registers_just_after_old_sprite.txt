# Sprite Multiplexing Techniques by Cadaver (Lasse Oorni) - Method 2.4.2: 'Just after the old sprite'—write the first 8 sprites at frame top; then, for each subsequent virtual sprite, wait for the raster line just below the sprite being replaced and write new values. If Y is written last, glitches are prevented because a delayed write just results in the new sprite not being displayed (clean failure). Simpler and cleaner, but may drop sprites in tight formations (unacceptable in some games).

2.4.2 Just after the old sprite

For this method, the first 8 sprites have to be written at the top of the
frame. Then, we wait for the rasterline just below the first sprite, and write
the new sprite register values to re-use it. Repeat for the second sprite and
on until the last virtual sprite's register values have been written.

If we write the Y-coordinate last, we will actually ensure that no glitches
are possible: in the case the new sprite is too close to the old or writes are
otherwise delayed, the new sprite simply won't be displayed at all!

This method is simpler & cleaner, but in games where close sprite packing is
inevitable (like Green Beret), missing sprites to avoid glitches might not be
acceptable.
