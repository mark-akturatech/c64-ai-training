# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Important sprite registers: $07F8..$07FF sprite pointers, $D015 sprite enable bits, X coordinate registers $D000, $D002.., Y coordinate registers $D001, $D003..; X high bit for each sprite stored in $D010. Sprite colour registers at $D027/$D028 etc. Single-colour sprites use those colour registers.

Important Addresses
Now we move on to how you set coordinates and colours and turn on sprites. Turning the sprites on is simple. The sprites are numbered from 0 up to 7. The sprite whose pointer you set when you poke values into $07f8 is 0, the one at $07f9 is 1, and so on. You turn on the sprites by setting the corresponding bits in $d015. So, to turn on sprite number 0, you poke the value 1 into $d015. To turn on sprites 0 and 1, put 3 in $d015.

Setting the coordinates of the sprites are equally simple, with one small catch. The x coordinate registers are $d000 (sprite 0), $d002 (sprite 1) and so on, and the y coordinate registers are $d001, $d003 etc. As these registers can only store one byte each, you can only set coordinates between 0 and 255. But the visible portion of the screen is 320 pixels wide! The solution is that there's an 8th bit for each x register in $d010. So, if bit 0 in $d010 is set, sprite 0's x coordinate is 256, plus the value in $d000. This might sound a bit complicated, but you'll get used to it pretty quickly.

Setting the colours is the easiest part. For single colour sprites, you just poke the colour value of each sprite into the addresses $d027, $d028 etc. Read your favourite VIC reference for information on other stuff that you can do with sprites...
