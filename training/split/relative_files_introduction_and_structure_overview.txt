# ********* - Chapter 7.1: Introduction to RELative files — design for record/field structured data, side sectors and pointers, capacity (up to 720 records * up to 254 chars), and how DOS organizes side sectors and data blocks for relative access.




7. RELATIVE FILES

[ 7.1 INTRODUCTION ]

RELative files allow you to easily zero in on exactly the piece of
data that you want from the file.  It is more convenient for data
handling because it allows you to structure your files into records,
and into fields within those records.

The DOS keeps track of the tracks and blocks used, and even allows
records to overlap from one block to the next.  It is able to do this
because it establishes side sectors, a series of pointers for the
beginning of each record.  Each side sector can point to up to 120
records, and there may be 6 side sectors in a file.  There can be up
to 720 records in a file, and each record can be up to 254 characters,
so the file could be as large as the entire diskette.
