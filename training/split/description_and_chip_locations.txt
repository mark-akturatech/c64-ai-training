# CIA 6526 Complex Interface Adapter - Comprehensive Reference - Overview of the MOS 6526 Complex Interface Adapter (CIA): a 65XX-bus compatible peripheral providing flexible timing and I/O. Notes that two CIA chips are used in the Commodore 64: CIA 1 at $DC00-$DCFF (56320-56575) which triggers IRQ, and CIA 2 at $DD00-$DDFF (56576-56831) which triggers NMI. Also mentions other systems using the CIA (C128, SX64, 1570/71/81 disk drives).


=============================================================
1. DESCRIPTION
=============================================================

The 6526 Complex Interface Adapter (CIA) is a 65XX bus compatible
peripheral interface device with extremely flexible timing and I/O
capabilities. It is manufactured by MOS Technology / Commodore
Semiconductor Group.

Two CIA chips are used in the Commodore 64:
  - CIA 1 at $DC00-$DCFF (56320-56575) - triggers IRQ
  - CIA 2 at $DD00-$DDFF (56576-56831) - triggers NMI

The CIA is also used in the C128, SX64, and 1570/71/81 disk drives.
