# MACHINE - Table of three major kernal subroutines used in following examples: $FFD2 CHROUT (output ASCII character), $FFE4 GETIN (input ASCII character), $FFE1 STOP (checks RUN/STOP key). Notes on using CHROUT to print to the screen.

                                                                         :25:

The three major kernal subroutines that we will deal with in the next few
chapters are shown here:

Address     Name       What it does
-------------------------------------------------
$FFD2       CHROUT     Output an ASCII character
$FFE4       GETIN      Gets an ASCII character
$FFE1       STOP       Checks the RUN/STOP key

With the first two subroutines, we can input and output data easily.  The
third allows us to honor the RUN/STOP key, to guard against certain types of
programming error.  In this chapter, we'll use CHROUT to print information to
the screen.
