# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Intro to graphics on the C-64: need to know VIC registers, screen memory (default $0400), and colour RAM ($D800). Subsequent sections cover sprites, character graphics and bitmap graphics.

Graphics
Now it's time to move on to some more interesting stuff, making things happen on the screen. Of course, things have been happening with the screen in all the above examples, but not in a very controlled way.

To get things to happen on the screen, you need to know which VIC registers to put which values into. There's also the screen memory, which is normally located at $0400, and the colour memory, which is located at $d800, and works like the screen memory, but doesn't contain character codes, but colour values of the characters on the screen. But the VIC is the most important thing, so we'll start with some VIC basics.
