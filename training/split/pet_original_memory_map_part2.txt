# MACHINE - Continuation of the PET original memory map covering jiffy clock, keyboard buffer, IRQ/BRK vectors, ST status, file tables, tape buffers, and available RAM regions. Lists many zero-page and low-memory system locations and their uses, and ROM/Kernal ranges such as F000-FFFF for Kernal ROM.
