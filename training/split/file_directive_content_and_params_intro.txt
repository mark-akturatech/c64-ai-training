# Kick Assembler - Explains that .file uses an intermediate segment for content making it flexible; name parameter is mandatory and other parameters optional. Introduces Table 11.1 listing file directive parameters.


Like in the .file directive you can use %o notation to get the name of the sourcefile. You fill in extra parameters
as a comma separated list. Here we add a disk name and an id, which is displayed in the top of the directory:
.disk [filename="MyDisk.d64", name="THE DISK", id="2021!" ]
{
}
