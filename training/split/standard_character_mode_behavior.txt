# COMMODORE 64 - Standard character mode (MCM = BMM = ECM = 0): interpretation of 8 sequential bytes from the character base as 8 raster lines; bit-to-color mapping where a '0' bit selects the global background (#0 from register 33 ($21)) and a '1' bit selects the character's foreground color from the 4-bit color nybble stored in the video matrix. Explains that each character has a unique foreground color (4-bit nybble) while all characters share the common background color.

  STANDARD CHARACTER MODE (MCM = BMM = ECM = 0)

    In the standard character mode, the 8 sequential bytes from the
  character base are displayed directly on the 8 lines in each character
  region. A "0" bit causes the background #0 color (from register 33 ($21))
  to be displayed while the color selected by the color nybble (foreground)
  is displayed for a "1" bit (see Color Code Table).

                | CHARACTER |
     FUNCTION   |    BIT    |               COLOR DISPLAYED
  --------------+-----------+----------------------------------------------
    Background  |     0     |  Background #0 color
                |           |  (register 33 ($21)
    Foreground  |     1     |  Color selected by 4-bit color nybble


    Therefore, each character has a unique color determined by the 4-bit
  color nybble (1 of 16) and all characters share the common background
  color.
