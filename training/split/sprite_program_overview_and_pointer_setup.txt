# COMMODORE 64 - Introduces the minimal sprite program and its 'ingredients'. Explains that POKE numbers come from the SPRITEMAKING CHART, identifies the program as defining sprite 0 (a solid square), and gives line-by-line start: LINE 10 clears the screen; LINE 20 sets the sprite pointer (sprite 0 at 2040 ... sprite 7 at 2047) and provides an alternate single-line FOR loop (20 FOR SP=2040TO2047:POKE SP,13:NEXT SP) to set all pointers.


    This program includes the key "ingredients" you need to create any
  sprite. The POKE numbers come from the SPRITEMAKING CHART on Page 176.
  This program defines the first sprite... sprite 0... as a solid white
  square on the screen. Here's a line-by-line explanation of the program:

    LINE 10 clears the screen.

    LINE 20 sets the "sprite pointer" to where the Commodore 64 will read
  its sprite data from. Sprite 0 is set at 2040, sprite 1 at 2041, sprite
  2 at 2042, and so on up to sprite 7 at 2047. You can set all 8 sprite
  pointers to 13 by using this line in place of line 20:

    20 FOR SP=2040TO2047:POKE SP,13:NEXT SP
