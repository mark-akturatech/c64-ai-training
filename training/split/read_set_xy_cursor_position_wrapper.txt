# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Wrapper at $FFF0 that JMPs to $E50A to read/set cursor X,Y position. Called with carry set to read XY into registers, carry clear to set cursor from XY.

                                *** read/set X,Y cursor position
                                this routine, when called with the carry flag set, loads the current position of
                                the cursor on the screen into the X and Y registers. X is the column number of
                                the cursor location and Y is the row number of the cursor. A call with the carry
                                bit clear moves the cursor to the position determined by the X and Y registers.
