# VIC-II Memory Banking and Address Configuration Guide - Important practical notes and caveats:
1) When changing banks, update the KERNAL screen page pointer at address 648/$0288 so BASIC/KERNAL I/O write to the correct screen location. Set it to (screen_address / 256).
2) In banks 0 and 2 the ROM charset is mapped into a 4 KB window; any data placed at those addresses (sprites, custom charset, screen) will be invisible to the VIC-II.
3) Color RAM at $D800-$DBE7 is independent of VIC bank selection and remains at the same addresses.
4) Sprite data pointers are stored in the last 8 bytes of screen memory (screen base + $03F8 to $03FF). Moving screen memory moves sprite pointers with it.
5) Always use read-modify-write when changing $DD00 to avoid disrupting the serial bus and other CIA-2 functions.

Important Notes
----------------

1. When changing banks, you must also update the KERNAL screen page pointer
   at address 648/$0288 so that BASIC and KERNAL I/O routines write to the
   correct screen location. Set it to: screen_address / 256.

2. In banks 0 and 2, the ROM character set is mapped into a 4 KB window.
   Any data (sprites, custom charset, screen) placed at those addresses
   will be invisible to the VIC-II -- it sees the ROM charset instead.

3. The color RAM at $D800-$DBE7 is independent of bank selection and is
   always at the same address regardless of which VIC bank is selected.

4. Sprite data pointers are stored in the last 8 bytes of screen memory
   (screen base + $03F8 to $03FF). When you move screen memory, the sprite
   pointers move with it.

5. Always use read-modify-write when changing $DD00 to avoid disrupting
   the serial bus and other CIA-2 functions.
