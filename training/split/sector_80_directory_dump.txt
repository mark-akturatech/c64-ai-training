# byRiclianll - Hex/ASCII dump of the data block labeled '80:'. Contains repeated placeholder bytes (displayed as 'XX'), numeric/ASCII fragments such as '59', 'N64. VI . Y', short numeric lines (88, : 54, 53, 50, 52, 49, 54, 45, 53) and the ASCII identifier 'TSPRITES'. Demonstrates a block with mixed arbitrary padding and readable text fragments that could come from previous buffer contents.
