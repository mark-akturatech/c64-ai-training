# ********* - STAL ($C1-$C2) — Two-byte pointer to the I/O start address. Points to the beginning address in RAM currently being LOADed or SAVEd. For tape I/O it points to the cassette buffer; subsequent data blocks are loaded/saved directly to/from RAM. STAL indicates the RAM area used for blocks after the initial header.

I/O Start Address

This location points to the beginning address of the area in RAM which
is currently being LOADed or SAVEd.  For tape I/O, it will point to
the cassette buffer, and the rest of the data is LOADed or SAVEd
directly to or from RAM.  This location points to the beginning
address of the area of RAM to be used for the blocks of data that come
after the initial header.
