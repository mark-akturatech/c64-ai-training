# NMOS 6510 - Documents LAX ($AB, lines 1475–1479) and ANE ($8B, lines 1485–1489) undocumented opcodes. Shows opcode bytes and high-level semantics: LAX sets A and X from memory with a bitmask/style (A,X = (A | CONST) & #{imm}); ANE performs A = (A | CONST) & X & #{imm}. Also lists the reported flag effects for these opcodes (lines 1481–1493).
