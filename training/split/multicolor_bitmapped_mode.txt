# Contents - Multicolor bitmap mode: enable by turning on bitmap graphics and then setting bit 5 of YSCRL ($D011) (MULTON/MULTOF macros). In this mode each byte is interpreted as 4 bit-pairs (each pair selects one of 4 colors). Color sources: BCOLO ($D021) background, upper/lower nibbles of character RAM for two colors, and color RAM for the fourth color. Effective resolution halved horizontally (160x200).




Multicolor Bitmapped Mode 

To turn on the multicolor bit mapped mode, you 
must first turn on the bit mapped graphics mode 
as shown above. Then you must set bit 5 of the 
YSCRL register. You can turn off the multicolor 
mode by clearing bit 5 of the YSCRL register. The 
macros MULTON and MULTOF can be used to 
turn on and off the multicolor modes. 

In the multicolor mode, four colors can be 
displayed in each 4 by 8 group of pixels. Each byte 
in graphics memory is broken down into 4 bit pairs. 
Each bit pair specifies where the color information 
will be found for each pixel. In addition to the two 
colors that are defined in text memory, the color 
RAM is used in this mode to hold one more color. 
The fourth color is the background color that is 
stored in BCOLO ($D021). The correspondence be- 
tween the bit pairs in graphics RAM and where the 
color is found is shown in the following chart:
