# COMMODORE 64 - NOT <expression>: logical operator that complements bits of its operand (bitwise NOT) producing two's-complement integer result; operands converted to 16-bit signed integers (fractions lost). Also used to reverse boolean comparisons. Example of numeric NOT and relation to two's-complement: note showing X = (-(X+1)) to compute NOT.

  NOT

  TYPE: Logical Operator
  FORMAT: NOT <expression>

    Action: The NOT logical operator "complements" the value of each bit
  in its single operand, producing an integer "twos-complement" result. In
  other words, the NOT is really saying, "if it isn't. When working with a
  floating-point number, the operands are converted to integers and any
  fractions are lost. The NOT operator can also be used in a comparison to
  reverse the true/false value which was the result of a relationship test
  and therefore it will reverse the meaning of the comparison. In the first
  example below, if the "twos-complement" of "AA" is equal to "BB" and if
  "BB" is NOT equal to "CC" then the expression is true.

  EXAMPLES of NOT Operator:

    10 IF NOT AA = BB AND NOT(BB = CC) THEN...

    NN% = NOT 96: PRINT NN%
    -97

  | NOTE: TO find the value of NOT use the expression X=(-(X+1)). (The    |
  | two's complement of any integer is the bit complement plus one.)      |
