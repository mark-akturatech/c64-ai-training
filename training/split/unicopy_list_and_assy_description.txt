# MACHINE - UNICOPY LIST and ]UNICOPY ASSY: assembly listing and data file for UNICOPY. The listing is of special interest because UNICOPY is written in machine language and performs tasks often more conveniently done in BASIC (file open/close etc.). The listing uses symbolic addresses and supports output to screen or printer; cassette output uses ROM routines.

                                                                        :311:

  UNICOPY LIST
  ]UNICOPY ASSY

An assembly listing of program UNICOPY.  Because UNICOPY is written entirely
in machine language, a number of tasks are performed in the program that are
often more conveniently done in BASIC.  For example, files are opened and
closed by machine language.  This makes the program listing particularly
interesting for students of these techniques.

Assembly listings have a somewhat different appearance from the machine
language programs this book has dealt with.  The most visible difference is
the use of symbolic addresses.  If there is any confusion, concentrate on the
machine language half of the listing; that will clarify what's going on.
Program UNICOPY LIST allows output to the screen or to a Commodore printer.

For cassette tape output, direct calls to the ROM routines are made; that's
usually not a good practice, but there's little choice here.
