# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - Subtracts paired zero page bytes: performs SEC then subtracts $AE from $AC and $AF from $AD (A5 AC / SBC $AE ; A5 AD / SBC $AF ; RTS). Used to compute relative offsets or lengths between pointer pairs.

.,FCD1 38       SEC
.,FCD2 A5 AC    LDA $AC
.,FCD4 E5 AE    SBC $AE
.,FCD6 A5 AD    LDA $AD
.,FCD8 E5 AF    SBC $AF
.,FCDA 60       RTS
