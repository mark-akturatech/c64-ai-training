# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Issue UNTALK and UNLISTEN commands on the IEC bus: disable interrupts, pull clock low, set ATN low (UNTALK = $5F, UNLISTEN = $3F), send control character, set ATN high again, perform a short delay, then set clock/data lines high and return.

                                *** command serial bus to UNTALK
.,EDEF 78       SEI             disable the interrupts
.,EDF0 20 8E EE JSR $EE8E       set the serial clock out low
.,EDF3 AD 00 DD LDA $DD00       read VIA 2 DRA, serial port and video address
.,EDF6 09 08    ORA #$08        mask xxxx 1xxx, set the serial ATN low
.,EDF8 8D 00 DD STA $DD00       save VIA 2 DRA, serial port and video address
.,EDFB A9 5F    LDA #$5F        set the UNTALK command
.:EDFD 2C       .BYTE $2C       makes next line BIT $3FA9

.,EE00 20 11 ED JSR $ED11       send a control character
.,EE03 20 BE ED JSR $EDBE       set serial ATN high
                                1ms delay, clock high then data high
.,EE06 8A       TXA             save the device number
.,EE07 A2 0A    LDX #$0A        short delay

.,EE0D 20 85 EE JSR $EE85       set the serial clock out high
.,EE10 4C 97 EE JMP $EE97       set the serial data out high and return
