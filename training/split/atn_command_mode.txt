# Commodore IEC Serial Bus Protocol Reference - pagetable.com - ATN (Attention) command mode: controller pulls ATN to force all devices into receiver (command) mode. Command bytes use same byte transmission mechanics; EOI is NOT used during commands. Devices typically respond within 1000 µs (ATN response timing).

Command Transmission (ATN):
  When the controller needs to broadcast commands to all devices:
    - Controller pulls the ATN line
    - ALL devices are forced into receiver mode regardless of current state
    - Byte transmission uses identical mechanics to data transfer
    - EOI signaling is NOT used during command transmission
    - Devices typically respond within 1000 microseconds (ATN Response Timing)
