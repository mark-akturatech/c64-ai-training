# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - EA24: Computes the colour-RAM pointer for the current screen line: reads current screen line pointer low/high ($D1/$D2), saves low into $F3, masks the high byte to line page (AND #$03), ORs with the colour memory page (ORA #$D8), and saves the resulting high byte to $F4. Returns (RTS).

.,EA24 A5 D1    LDA $D1         get current screen line pointer low byte
