# NMOS 6510 - Detailed code sequences for variants c..f which use absolute addressing to fetch background colour values and then write them to $D021. Covers: c (mid-grey) — LDY abs, STY $D021, NOP; d (light green) — LDA abs, STA $D021, NOP; e (light blue) — LDX abs, STX $D021, NOP; f (light grey) — LAX abs, SAX $D021, NOP. Each variant shows opcode bytes (abs addressing with a base like $03b0 + <background colour>), cycle counts and padding. This chunk completes the enumeration of all 16 per-nibble variants used in the Blackmail FLI trick.
