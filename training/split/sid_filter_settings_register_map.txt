# COMMODORE 64 - SID FILTER SETTINGS table mapping the memory locations used for SID filter configuration: locations 54293-54296 ($D41D-$D420). Specifies the contents of each location: low cutoff (54293), high cutoff (54294), resonance and per-voice filter enable bits (54295), and filter type bits plus global volume (54296). Includes surrounding spacing and footer lines from the source.
