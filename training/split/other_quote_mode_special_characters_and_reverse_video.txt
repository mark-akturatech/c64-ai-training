# COMMODORE 64 - Additional quote-mode special characters not readily available from keyboard: SHIFT+RETURN (<SHIFT+M>) (causes a CR without ending string), switches for case and case-switching enable/disable (letters N, SHIFT+N, H, I in reversed form). How to insert by editing, using RVS ON/OFF for reverse video (CTRL+RVS), terminating reverse video with CHR$(146) or CR. Notes about printer character set switching when sending reversed 'N' to printer, and that LIST editing becomes near-impossible when these special characters are embedded.

    There are some other characters that can be printed for special func-
  tions, although they are not easily available from the keyboard. In order
  to get these into quotes, you must leave empty spaces for them in the
  line, press <RETURN>, and go back to edit the line. Now you hold down
  the <CTRL> (ConTRoL) key and type <RVS ON> (ReVerSe-ON) to start typing
  reversed characters. Type the keys as shown below:


    Key Function                Key Entered         Appearance

    Shifted RETURN              <SHIFT+M>
    Switch to upper/lower case  <N>
    Switch to upper/graphics    <SHIFT+N>


    Holding down the <SHIFT> key and hitting <RETURN> causes a carriage-
  return and line-feed on the screen but does not end the string. This
  works with LIST as well as PRINT, so editing will be almost impossible if
  this character is used. When output is switched to the printer via the
  CMD statement, the reverse "N" character shifts the printer into its
  upper-lower case character set and the <SHIFT> "N" shifts the printer
  into the upper-case/graphics character set.
    Reverse video characters can be included in strings by holding down
  the ConTRoL <CTRL> key and pressing ReVerSe <RVS>, causing a reversed R
  to appear inside the quotes. This will make all characters print in
  reverse video (like a negative of a photograph). To end the reverse
  printing, press <CTRL> and <RVS OFF> (ReVerSe OFF) by holding down the
  <CTRL> key and typing the <RVS OFF> key, which prints a reverse R.
  Numeric data can be printed in reverse video by first printing a
  CHR$(18). Printing a CHR$(146) or a carriage-return will cancel reverse
  video output.
