# NMOS 6510 - Assembly listing demonstrating use of the undocumented LAX immediate opcode (AB). Shows LDA #$00 followed by LAX #$FF (AB FF), a subsequent DCP instruction that accesses memory $FF97,X, and an RTS. Comments record the observed effect: A and X become (($00 | CONST) & $FF) = $EE (magic-constant behaviour) and the accumulator value ($EE).
