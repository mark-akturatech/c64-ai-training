# Contents - Explanation of resolution tradeoff in multicolor text: characters become 4x8 pixel cells (horizontal halved). Each pair of bits in a character's byte encodes one of 4 color sources. Mapping: Bit pair 00 = BCOL0, 01 = BCOL1, 10 = BCOL3, 11 = lower 3 bits of COLOR RAM (note: BCOL registers referenced).


As stated earlier, you sacrifice 1 /2 of the 
horizontal resolution of the normal text mode when 
you select the multicolor mode. This means that 
each character will be made up of an array of 4 by 
8 pixels. It still takes 8 bytes to define a character, 
but instead of each bit corresponding to a pixel on 
the screen, each PAIR of bits represents one of 4 
registers to use to find the color for the bit pair. The 
following chart shows the correlation between bit 
pairs and registers.
