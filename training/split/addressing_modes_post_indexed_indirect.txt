# 6502 Microprocessor - Post-indexed indirect: LDA (zp),Y — zero-page address supplies pointer (two bytes), add Y to that pointer to get effective address, then load. Only Y is used in this mode. Example step-by-step provided.

  10) Post-indexed indirect
  In this mode the contents of a zero-page address (and the following byte)
  give the indirect addressm which is added to the contents of the Y-register
  to yield the actual address of the operand. Again, inassembly language,
  the instruction is indicated by parenthesis.
  eg.  LDA ($4C), Y
  Note that the parenthesis are only around the 2nd byte of the instruction
  since it is the part that does the indirection.
  Assume the following -        byte       value
                                $004C      $00
                                $004D      $21
                                Y-reg.     $05
                                $2105      $6D
  Then the instruction above executes by:
  (i)   getting the address in bytes $4C, $4D = $2100
  (ii)  adding the contents of the Y-register = $2105
  (111) loading the contents of the byte $2105 - i.e. $6D into the
        accumulator.
  Note: only the Y-register is used in this mode.
