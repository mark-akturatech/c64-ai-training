# byRiclianll - Seek logic and job dispatch: REM SEEK section that normalizes the sector number (wraps S to NS if zero, decrements S for zero-based indexing), sets JOB to the line number handling the actual seek (JOB=176) and calls the job-queue routine via GOSUB 570. This chunk prepares a drive-side seek job for the selected track/sector.
