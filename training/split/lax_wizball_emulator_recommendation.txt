# NMOS 6510 - Empirical notes from testing Wizball binaries in emulation: specific magic-constant immediate values that cause game crashes ($63, $64, $67, $68, $69, $6A, $D1, $D2, $EF). Concludes $EF likely didn't occur on real C64s. Recommends emulators use $EE (not $EF) for the undocumented LAX magic constant in both normal and RDY cycles. Notes that one known program ('Blackmail FLI') uses LAX #imm and may break but was historically flaky.

Some different Wizball binaries have been tested (in Emulation) with all possible “magic
constants”, and the following values result in misbehaviour (crash) of the game: $63, $64, $67,
$68, $69, $6A, $D1, $D2, $EF – So we can assume these ($EF in particular) did not occur on
real C64s - at least no horror stories from the 80s about Wizball not working (randomly) are known
to exist.
Emulation

Due to the above, emulators are advised to use $EE (not $EF) for the “magic constant” in both
normal and RDY cycles. This will break at least one other program that is known to use LAX #imm
– the “Blackmail FLI” mentioned in the appendix – however, that program was known to be flaky
even back in the days, and the use of LAX #imm might very well be the reason for that.
