# CA65 Assembler - Control Commands (.FATAL .FEATURE - Emulation Features)

11.41 .FEATURE
This directive may be used to enable one or more compatibility features of the assembler. While the use of .FEATURE should be avoided when possible, it may be useful when porting sources written for other assemblers. After the feature name an optional '+' or '-' may specify whether to enable or disable the feature (enable if omitted). Multiple features may be enabled, separated by commas. Examples:


        ; enable c_comments
        .feature   c_comments
        .feature   c_comments +
        ; enable force_range, disable underline_in_numbers, enable labels_without_colons
        .feature   force_range, underline_in_numbers -, labels_without_colons +
        .feature   force_range +, underline_in_numbers off, labels_without_colons on
  
The following features are available:


at_in_identifiers
Accept the at character ('@') as a valid character in identifiers. The at character is not allowed to start an identifier, even with this feature enabled.

bracket_as_indirect
Use [] instead of () for the indirect addressing modes. Example:


        lda     [$82]
        lda     [$82,x]
        lda     [$82],y
        jmp     [$fffe]
        jmp     [table,x]
    
Note: This should not be used in 65186 mode because it conflicts with the 65816 instruction syntax for far addressing. See the section covering address sizes for more information.
c_comments
Allow C like comments using /* and */ as left and right comment terminators. Note that C comments may not be nested. There's also a pitfall when using C like comments: All statements must be terminated by "end-of-line". Using C like comments, it is possible to hide the newline, which results in error messages. See the following non working example:


        lda     #$00  /* This comment hides the newline
*/      sta     $82
    
dollar_in_identifiers
Accept the dollar sign ('$') as a valid character in identifiers. The dollar character is not allowed to start an identifier, even with this feature enabled.

dollar_is_pc
The dollar sign may be used as an alias for the star ('*'), which gives the value of the current PC in expressions. Note: Assignment to the pseudo variable is not allowed.

force_range
Force expressions into their valid range for immediate addressing and storage operators like .BYTE and .WORD. Be very careful with this one, since it will completely disable error checks.

labels_without_colons
Allow labels without a trailing colon. These labels are only accepted, if they start at the beginning of a line (no leading white space).

leading_dot_in_identifiers
Accept the dot ('.') as the first character of an identifier. This may be used for example to create macro names that start with a dot emulating control directives of other assemblers. Note however, that none of the reserved keywords built into the assembler, that starts with a dot, may be overridden. When using this feature, you may also get into trouble if later versions of the assembler define new keywords starting with a dot.

line_continuations
Switch on or off line continuations using the backslash character before a newline. The option is off by default. Note: Line continuations do not work in a comment. A backslash at the end of a comment is treated as part of the comment and does not trigger line continuation.

Example:


          .feature line_continuations +   ; Allow line continuations

          lda     \
                  #$20                    ; This is legal now
    
For backward compatibility reasons, the .LINECONT + control command is also supported and enables the same feature.

long_jsr_jmp_rts
Affects 65816 mode only.

Allows jsr and jmp to produce long jumps if the target address has been previously declared in a far segment, or imported as far. Otherwise jsl and jml must be used instead.

Also allows .SMART to convert rts to a long return rtl when the enclosing scope or memory model indicates returning from a far procedure.

This permits compatibility with the old behavior of this assembler, or other assemblers which similarly allowed jsr and jmp to be used this way.

loose_char_term
Accept single quotes as well as double quotes as terminators for char constants.

loose_string_term
Accept single quotes as well as double quotes as terminators for string constants.

missing_char_term
Accept single quoted character constants where the terminating quote is missing.

        lda     #'a
    
Note: This does not work in conjunction with .FEATURE loose_string_term, since in this case the input would be ambiguous.
org_per_seg
This feature makes relocatable/absolute mode local to the current segment. Using .ORG when org_per_seg is in effect will only enable absolute mode for the current segment. Ditto for .RELOC.

pc_assignment
Allow assignments to the PC symbol ('*' or '$' if dollar_is_pc is enabled). Such an assignment is handled identical to the .ORG command (which is usually not needed, so just removing the lines with the assignments may also be an option when porting code written for older assemblers).

string_escapes
Allow C-style backslash escapes within string constants to embed special characters. The following escapes are accepted:

\\ backslash ($5C)
\' single quote ($27)
\" double quote ($22)
\t tab ($09)
\r carriage return ($0D)
\n newline ($0A)
\xNN ($NN)
Note that string escapes are converted to platform-specific characters in the same way that other characters are converted.

ubiquitous_idents
Allow the use of instructions names as names for macros and symbols. This makes it possible to "overload" instructions by defining a macro with the same name. This does also make it possible to introduce hard to find errors in your code, so be careful!

underline_in_numbers
Allow underlines within numeric constants. These may be used for grouping the digits of numbers for easier reading. Example:

        .feature        underline_in_numbers
        .word           %1100001110100101
        .word           %1100_0011_1010_0101    ; Identical but easier to read
    
It is also possible to specify features on the command line using the --feature command line option. This is useful when translating sources written for older assemblers, when you don't want to change the source code.

As an example, to translate sources written for Andre Fachats xa65 assembler, the features


        labels_without_colons, pc_assignment, loose_char_term
  
may be helpful. They do not make ca65 completely compatible, so you may not be able to translate the sources without changes, even when enabling these features. However, I have found several sources that translate without problems when enabling these features on the command line.
