# MACHINE - Compact reference list of 6502/Commodore 64 instruction mnemonics with short descriptions. Covers arithmetic and logical ops (ADC, AND, EOR, ORA, SBC), shifts and rotates (ASL, LSR, ROL, ROR), branch instructions (BCC, BCS, BEQ, BMI, BNE, BPL, BVC, BVS), status/flag control (CLC, CLD, CLI, CLV, SEC, SED, SEI), compare instructions (CMP, CPX, CPY), increment/decrement and memory modify (INC, INX, INY, DEC, DEX, DEY), bit test (BIT), jumps and subroutine control (JMP, JSR, RTS, RTI, BRK), loads and stores (LDA, LDX, LDY, STA, STX, STY), stack operations (PHA, PHP, PLA, PLP), transfer instructions between registers and stack pointer (TAX, TAY, TSX, TXA, TXS, TYA), and the NOP instruction. Includes surrounding blank lines and page markers as they appear in the original listing.
