# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL ROM Disassembly (English, "CBM") - List and brief explanation of all zero-page variables used by the cassette read routines: REZ, RER, DIFF, SYNO, SNSW1, DATA, MYCH, FIRT, SVXT, TEMP, PRTY, PRP, FSBLK, SHCNL, RDFLG (modes MI/VS/NE), SAL, SHCNH, BAD table, PTR1/PTR2, VERCHK, CMP0, DPSW, PCNTR, STUPID, KIKA26 and their roles in timing capture, dipole/byte decoding, parity and pass management.
