# ********* - Patched area in later Kernal versions (locations $FF5B-$FF7F area) used to detect PAL vs NTSC and compensate timing so the 1/60s IRQ is accurate on both systems.

Location Range: 65371-65407 ($FF5B-$FF7F)
Patches Added to Later Kernal Versions

This area contains additional code not found in the original version
of the Kernal.  It is used to test whether a European (PAL) or U.S.
(NTSC) standard monitor is used, and to compensate so that the
sixtieth of a second interrupt will be accurately timed on either
system.
