# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Get a byte from the RS-232 device: call the RS-232 get-byte routine, handle its error flag (BCS), test for null return and, if null, examine RS-232 status ($0297) for DSR/other status bits, looping or returning [EOL] as appropriate. Implements the higher-level loop around the Rx buffer retrieval for RS-232 devices.
