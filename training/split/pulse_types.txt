# Datassette Encoding - Defines the three pulse length categories and their nominal durations for NTSC and PAL: Short (NTSC 176 µs, PAL 182.7 µs), Medium (NTSC 256 µs, PAL 265.7 µs), Long (NTSC 336 µs, PAL 348.8 µs).

Pulse Types
-----------

Three pulse types are used:

    Type      NTSC         PAL
    Short     176 µs       182.7 µs
    Medium    256 µs       265.7 µs
    Long      336 µs       348.8 µs
