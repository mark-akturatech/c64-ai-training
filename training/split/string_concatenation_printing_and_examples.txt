# Kick Assembler - Concatenation and printing: using + to append strings and combine with numeric values, examples (.var x=25; .var myString = "X is " + x), using .print to output strings during assembly for debugging, printing label values (recommend converting to hex with toHexString), and a short example assembly snippet showing label usage.

Every object has a string representation and you can concatenate strings with the + operator. For example:
.var x=25
.var myString= “X is “ + x

// Gives myString = "X is 25"

You can use the .print directive to print a string to the console while assembling. This is useful when debugging.
Printing x and y can be done like this:
.print "x="+x
.print "y="+y

You can also print labels to see which location they refer to. If you do this, it's best to convert the label value
to hexadecimal notation first:
.print “int1=$”+toHexString(int1)
int1:

sta regA+1
stx regX+1
sty regY+1
lsr $d019
// Etc.

Here is a list of functions/operators defined on strings:
