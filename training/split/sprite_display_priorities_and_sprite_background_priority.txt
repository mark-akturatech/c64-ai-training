# COMMODORE 64 - Explains sprite priorities: sprite-to-sprite priority is fixed by sprite number (lower-numbered sprite drawn in front). Sprite-to-background priority is controlled by SPRITE-BACKGROUND PRIORITY register at 53275 ($D01B): each sprite has a bit; 0 -> sprite in front of background, 1 -> sprite behind background. Note that 'window' effects can occur when higher priority sprites have transparent 'holes' showing lower-priority sprites or background.


  SPRITE DISPLAY PRIORITIES

    Sprites have the ability to cross each other's paths, as well as cross
  in front of, or behind other objects on the screen. This can give you a
  truly three dimensional effect for games.
    Sprite to sprite priority is fixed. That means that sprite 0 has the
  highest priority, sprite 1 has the next priority, and so on, until we get
  to sprite 7, which has the lowest priority. In other words, if sprite 1
  and sprite 6 are positioned so that they cross each other, sprite 1 will
  be in front of sprite 6.
    So when you're planning which sprites will appear to be in the fore-
  ground of the picture, they must be assigned lower sprite numbers than
  those sprites you want to put towards the back of the scene. Those
  sprites will be given higher sprite numbers,

  | NOTE: A "window" effect is possible. If a sprite with higher priority |
  | has "holes" in it (areas where the dots are not set to 1 and thus     |
  | turned ON), the sprite with the lower priority will show through. This|
  | also happens with sprite and background data.                         |
  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

    Sprite to background priority is controllable by the SPRITE-BACK-
  GROUND priority register located at 53275 ($D01B). Each sprite has a bit
  in this register. If that bit is 0, that sprite has a higher priority
  than the background on the screen. In other words, the sprite appears in
  front of background data. If that bit is a 1, that sprite has a lower
  priority than the background. Then the sprite appears behind the back-
  ground data.
