# MACHINE - Project suggestion: extend the simple addition program to allow two-digit results (max 18). Compare for result > 9 and, if so, print '1' then subtract ten, etc.

we want the main routine, remember?

Give the SYS 850 command.  Tap a couple of numeric keys that total nine or
less.  Watch the result appear instantly on the screen.

                                                                         :68:

If you like, set up a BASIC loop and call the routine several times.

Project for enthusiasts:  You couldn't resist, could you?  You had to type in
two digits that totaled over 9 and got a silly result.  OK, your project is
to try to expand the above code to allow for two-digit results.  It's not
that hard, since the highest possible total is 9+9 or 18; so if there are two
digits, the first one must be the digit 1.  You'll need to compare for the
result over binary nine, and then arrange for printing the one and
subtracting ten if necessary.  Sounds like fun.
