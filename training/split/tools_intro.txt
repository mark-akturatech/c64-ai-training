# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Overview of essential tools: a monitor and/or assembler (Turbo Assembler recommended for examples). Pros and cons of monitor vs assembler for demo coding.

Tools
Before we jump straight to demo programming, I need to introduce some tools. The necessary tools are a monitor and/or an assembler. You can choose to do your programming either in a monitor or an assembler. Which choice is the best is up to you. People have different opinions, but these days most people would probably say that an assembler is the best choice, because it makes programming more easy, as you can move stuff around, insert code into already existing code, add comments and use labels. On the other hand, if you program in a monitor, you know exactly where in memory your code is and you know where the page borders are, something which is really important when it comes to writing code that needs perfect timing.

Anyway, I'll try to describe how you can do some stuff with a monitor and with an assembler. All the example code in this text is in Turbo Assembler format, so maybe it's easiest for you to use Turbo Assembler to start with. The reason why I use Turbo Assembler format is that most people in the scene use Turbo Assembler, and I use it myself.
