# COMMODORE 64 - BASIC example (page130.prg) demonstrating scrolling text onto the bottom of the screen: go to 24-row mode, clear screen, position cursor to bottom, set Y scroll to 7 (POKE 53265,(PEEK(53265)AND248)+7), print text and loop decrementing scroll position with delays to animate scrolling.

    To scroll text onto the screen from the bottom, you would step the low-
  order 3 bits of location 53265 from 0-7, put more data on the covered
  line at the bottom of the screen, and then repeat the process. To scroll
  characters onto the screen from left to right, you would step the low-
  order 3 bits of location 53270 from 0 to 7, print or POKE another column
  of new data into column 0 of the screen, then repeat the process.
    If you step the scroll bits by -1, your text will move in the opposite
  direction.

  EXAMPLE: Text scrolling onto the bottom of the screen:

start tok64 page130.prg
  10 poke53265,peek(53265)and247        :rem go into 24 row mode
  20 printchr$(147)                     :rem clear the screen
  30 forx=1to24:printchr$(17);:next     :rem move the cursor to the bottom
  40 poke53265,(peek(53265)and248)+7:print :rem position for 1st scroll
  50 print"     hello";
  60 forp=6to0step-1
  70 poke53265,(peek(53265)and248)+p
  80 forx=1to50:next                    :rem delay loop
  90 next:goto40
stop tok64
