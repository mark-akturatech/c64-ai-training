# MACHINE - Warnings about modifying the IRQ vector: avoid leaving it in an inconsistent state (half old/half new address) and the need to prevent interrupts while updating a two-byte vector.

A warning about interrupt programs:  changing the IRQ vector is likely to
make it difficult to load and save programs.  You may need to put the vector
back to its original state before you attempt any of these activities.
