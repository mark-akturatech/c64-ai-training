# byRiclianll - Notes that example disk images (1541TEST/DEMO) have no sequential files; explains that a sequential file is designated by $81 in the directory. Introduces the 'DIRECTORY' sequential file on the C-64 DISK BONUS PACK and shows its directory entry (track 18 sector 01 and starting block information).

No  sequential  files  appear  on  the  1541TEST/DEMO.  (The  file  named  SEQUENTIAL 
FILE  is  a  program  file  demonstrating  the  sequential  access  method.)  The  C-64  DISK 
BONUS  PACK  does  come  with  one  sequential  file  on  it.  The  file  named  "  DIREC- 
TORY "  appears  as  a  SEQ  when  displaying  the  directory.  "  DIRECTORY  " 
can  be  found  at  track  18,  sector  01  on  the  C-64  DISK  BONUS  PACK.  Let's  take  a  peek 
at  the  directory  entry  for  this  file: 

TRACK   18  -  SECTOR  01 

.  20:  GO  OO  81    11   Ol   20  20  20   

.  28:  44  49  52  45  43  54  4F  52  DIRECTOR 

.  30:  59  20  20  20  AO  OO  00  OO  Y  ... 

.  38:  OO  OO  OO  OO  OO  OO  02  00   


DIRECTORY     "  is  the  second  file  entry  in  the  directory. 

.    20:    OO  00  81  11   01   20  20  20   

**  ** 

.    28:    44  49  52  45  43  54  4F  52  DIRECTOR 

.    30:    59  20  20  20  AO  00  OO  OO  Y   

.    38:    OO  OO  OO  OO  OO  OO  02  OO   


A  sequential  file  is  designated  by  an  $81  in  the  directory.  The  first  block  of  this  file 
is  stored  on  track  17  ($11),  sector  1  ($01).  We  also  see  that  "  DIRECTORY  "  is 
two  blocks  long  (2  +  0*  256).  Let's  take  a  look  at  the  first  half  of  the  starting  data  block.
