# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - SYSTEM HARDWARE VECTORS ($FFFA-$FFFE and padding). Contains the three standard hardware vectors: NMI vector ($FFFA-$FFFB -> $FE43), RESET vector ($FFFC-$FFFD -> $FCE2) and IRQ vector ($FFFE-$FFFF -> $FF48). Also includes a padding 4-byte signature at $FFF6 (bytes 52 52 42 59). These vectors point to ROM routines that perform indirect JMPs to RAM-based handlers.

                                *** SYSTEM HARDWARE VECTORS
                                This table contains jumpvectors for system reset, IRQ, and
                                NMI. The IRQ and NMI vectors points to addresses which
                                contains an indirect jump to RAM, to provide user defined
                                routines.
