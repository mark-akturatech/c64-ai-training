# Contents - Standard bitmapped mode: enable by setting bit 5 of YSCRL ($D011) (GRAPH macro). To disable, clear bit 5 (TEXT macro). In standard bitmap mode, color for each 8x8 block is stored in text memory: high 4 bits = color when pixel bit is 1, low 4 bits = background color when pixel bit is 0. Color RAM is not used in standard bitmap mode.


To turn on the standard bitmapped mode, you 
must set bit 5 of the YSCRL register. The GRAPH 
macro will perform this function for you. To turn 
off the bitmapped mode, you must clear bit 5 of the 
YSCRL register. You can use the TEXT macro to 
perform this function. 

In the standard bitmapped mode, the colors for 
each 8 by 8 group of pixels are stored in text 
memory. The high 4 bits control the color of a pix- 
el if its associated memory bit is on, while the lower 
4 bits specify the color of a pixel if its bit is off. Color 
RAM is not used in the standard bitmapped mode.
