::Foreword::

This is a memory map of the Commodore 64 personal computer.  But it's
much more than that.  It's a reference book which every programmer who
uses the 64 will find invaluable.  What is a memory map?  It's a list
of the memory locations in a computer.  But Mapping the Commodore 64
is a memory amp that goes much further.  It explains the purpose of
each location and shows you how to change the contents of many of
them.  You can make the computer do what you want it to.  If you're a
BASIC programmer, you'll find easy-to-understand explanations of how
to use the advanced features of the Commodore 64, and how to include
these features in your own programs.  If you're already using machine
language to write your own programs, you'll use this guide over and
over again, referring to specific memory locations and routines.
You'll have the most complete guide to the Commodore 64's memory
available.

As with all COMPUTE! books, the explanations are clear and easy to
understand.  Beginning and advanced programmers alike will find
Mapping the Commodore 64 a valuable resource.
