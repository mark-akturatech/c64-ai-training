# MACHINE - Continues the Commodore 64 memory map: details zero-page pointer meanings ($003B-$0070 areas), accumulators, file tables, tape pointers, cassette buffer, default IRQ/BRK/NMI/USR vectors, cassette buffer region, available RAM and ROM mapping including character sets, VIC/VIA/CIA/I/O addresses (e.g., $9000-$91FF for VIC/VIA on VIC-20 mapping earlier), and notes on chip-direction registers at $0000-$0001 for 6510 bank switching.
