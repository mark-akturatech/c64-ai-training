# Datassette Encoding - Compatibility note between PAL and NTSC systems: despite different clock frequencies (PAL 985,248 Hz vs NTSC 1,022,727 Hz ≈ 3.8% difference), the synchronization algorithm and variable motor speed compensation allow tapes to be swapped between systems without issues.

PAL/NTSC Compatibility
----------------------

Despite the different PAL and NTSC clock frequencies (985248 Hz vs 1022727 Hz),
there is no issue with swapping tapes between systems. The synchronization
algorithm and variable motor speeds compensate for the approximately 3.8%
clock difference.
