# ********* - Section 3.7: VERIFY command format (VERIFY name$, device#) — byte-by-byte comparison between memory and disk file including line links; limitations when verifying across different machine memory configurations (e.g., VIC 20 vs C64).



3.7 VERIFY

The VERIFY command works to check the program currently in memory
against the program on disk.  You must include a device# with the
VERIFY command.  The computer does a byte-by-byte comparison of the
program, including line links -- which may be different for different
memory configurations.  For instance, if a program was SAVED to disk
from a 5K VIC 20, and re-LOADed on an 8K machine, it wouldn't VERIFY
properly because the links point to different memory locations.

FORMAT FOR VERIFY COMMAND:

   VERIFY name$, device#
