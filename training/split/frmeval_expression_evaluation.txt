# ********* - FRMEVAL ($AD9E) — Evaluate expressions: the main expression-evaluation entry point and group of subroutines used across BASIC. Responsibilities include tokenizing ASCII expression text, separating operators and terms, error checking, performing operations to combine terms, handling string and numeric types (including variables and constants), and producing a single resulting value. Sets flags indicating string vs numeric result and whether numeric result is integer or floating-point.

Evaluate Expression

This is the beginning point of a very powerful group of subroutines
which are used extensively by BASIC.

The main purpose of these routines is to read in the ASCII text of
BASIC expressions, separate the operators and terms of the expression,
check them for errors, combine the individual terms by performing the
indicated operations, and obtain a single value which the BASIC
program can use.

This can be a very complex task, and expressions an be of the string
or numeric type, and can contain any type of variable, as well as
constants.

At the end, the flag which shows whether the resulting value is string
or numeric at 13 ($D) is set, and if the value is numeric, the flag at
14 ($E) is set as well, to show if it is an integer or floating point
numer.

- "let_statement_variable_assignment" which expands on LET uses FRMEVAL to compute right-hand expressions
- "if_statement" which expands on IF uses FRMEVAL to evaluate its conditional expression
- "frmnum_numeric_evaluation_and_type_check" which expands on FRMNUM works with FRMEVAL to perform type checking on evaluated values
