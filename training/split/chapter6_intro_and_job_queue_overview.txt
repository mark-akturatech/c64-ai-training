# byRiclianll - Chapter 6 introduction to intermediate direct-access programming: describes passing requests directly to the Floppy Disk Controller (FDC) via the job queue. Explains that the IP parses C64 commands into jobs which are poked into the job queue and are scanned by the FDC every 10 ms. Lists the high-level jobs FDC can perform (read sector, write sector, verify, seek, bump head, jump to routine, execute routine) and introduces that each job has a job code.


The  hexadecimal  and  decimal  equivalents  for  each  job  request  as  seen  by  the  FDC  are: 


Job  Code 

Description 

$80  (128) 

READ 

$90  (144) 

WRITE 

$A0  (160) 

VERIFY 

$B0  (176) 

SEEK 

$C0  (192) 

BUMP 

$D0  (208) 

JUMP 

$E0  (224) 

EXECUTE 

If  the  FDC  finds  a  job  request  in  the  job  queue,  it  attempts  to  carry  it  out.  Once  the 
job  is  complete  or  aborted  the  FDC  replaces  the  job  code  with  an  error  code.  The  error 
codes  returned  by  the  FDC  to  the  IP  are  listed  below.  The  IP  error  codes  and  their
