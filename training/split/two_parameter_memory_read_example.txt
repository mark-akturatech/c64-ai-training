# byRiclianll - Two-parameter memory-read example: selects buffer #0 ($0300-$03FF) via OPEN 2,8,2,"#0", performs PRINT#15,"U1";2;0;18;0 to read track 18 sector 0 into that buffer, then loops 0-255 issuing PRINT#15,"M-R" CHR$(i) CHR$(3) to retrieve bytes indexed into the buffer; uses GET#15 to transfer each byte to C64 (command channel), converts nulls to CHR$(0), and prints ASCII values/characters within printable range. Demonstrates indexed memory-read and using GET# on the command channel for memory-read responses.


Line  Range  Description 


150  Opens  logical  file  number  2  to  device  8  with  a  secondary 

address  of  2  assigning  buffer  number  0  ($0300  -  $03FF) 
as  a  workspace. 

160  Reads  the  block  from  drive  0,  track  18,  sector  0  into 

channel  2  buffer  area  ($0300  -  $03FF). 

190  Begin  loop  to  read  256  bytes  ($0300  -  $03FF). 

200  Indexed  memory-read  command  ($0300  -  $03FF). 

210  Transfer  a  byte  from  channel  2  buffer  area  to  C64 

memory  via  the  command  channel  (GET#15,).
