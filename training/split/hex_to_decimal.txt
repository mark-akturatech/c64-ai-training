# MACHINE - Algorithm to convert hexadecimal to decimal: stepwise multiply-then-add method illustrated on $12AC, with explanation about speaking hex digits (say 'one two A C' rather than 'twenty-four').

Hexadecimal to Decimal
----------------------

As we have seen, hexadecimal and binary numbers are easily interchangeable.
Although we will usually write values in "hex," occasionally we will need to
examine them in their true binary state to see a particular information bit.

Hexadecimal isn't hard to translate into decimal.  You may recall that in
early arithmetic we were taught that the number 24 meant, "two tens and four
units."  Similarly, hexadecimal 24 means "two sixteens and four units," or a
decimal value of 36.  By the way, it's better to say hex numbers as "two
four" rather than "twenty-four," to avoid confusion with decimal values.

                                                                          :7:

The formal procedure, or algorithm, to go from hex to decimal is as follows.

  Step 1:  Take the leftmost digit; if it's a letter A to F, convert it to
           the appropriate numeric value (A equals 10, B equals 11, and so
           on).

  Step 2:  If there are no more digits, you're finished; you have the number.
           Stop.

  Step 3:  Multiply the value so far by sixteen.  Add the next digit to the
           result, converting letters if needed.  Go back to step 2.

Using the above steps, let's convert the hexadecimal number $12AC.

  Step 1:  The leftmost digit is 1.

  Step 2:  There are more digits, so we'll continue.

  Step 3:  1 times 16 is 16, plus 2 gives 18.

  Step 2:  More digits to come.

  Step 3:  18 times 16 is 288, plus 10 (for A) gives 298.

  Step 2:  More digits to come

  Step 3:  298 x 16 is 4768, plus 12 (for C) gives 4780.

  Step 2:  No more digits:  4780 is the decimal value.

This is easy to do by hand or with a calculator.
