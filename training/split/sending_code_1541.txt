# A 256 Byte Autostart Fast Loader for the Commodore 64 - 1541-side encoding: the drive uses a 16-byte lookup table to encode signals and correct for inverted return lines. Example table pattern: "1111, 0111, 1101, 0101..." that interleaves four bits with inversion.


Sending Code (1541 side):

The 1541 drive encodes data using a 16-byte lookup table, correcting for
inverted signal lines on the return path. The table entry
"1111, 0111, 1101, 0101..." interleaves four bits with inversion.
