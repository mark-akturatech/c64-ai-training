# - C64 RAM Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $02A1 ENABL: RS-232 'interrupts enabled' flag byte (holds active NMI flag from CIA #2 Interrupt Control Register). Lists bit meanings: Bit 4 (16) = system waiting for receiver edge; Bit 1 (2) = system receiving data; Bit 0 (1) = system transmitting data.

$02A1        ENABL   RS-232 Interrupts Enabled
                     
                     This location holds the active NMI interrupt flag byte from CIA #2
                     Interrupt Control Register (56589, $DD0D).  The bit values for this
                     flag are as follows:
                     
                     |Bit|Value| |
                     |---|-----|-|
                     | 4 | 16  | 1 = System is Waiting for Receiver Edge |
                     | 1 | 2   | 1 = System is Receiving Data            |
                     | 0 | 1   | 1 = System is Transmitting Data         |
