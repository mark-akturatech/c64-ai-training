# NMOS 6510 - Overview of what the document provides: opcode charts for illegal opcodes, cycle-by-cycle addressing breakdowns, per-opcode formal descriptions (flags, behavior), test code references (VICE test-programs), examples and notes on dummy memory accesses and other CPU quirks.


Cycle by cycle breakdown of the 'illegal' addressing modes

•

For every 'illegal' opcode:
◦ Formal description of each opcode, including flags etc.
◦ General description of operation and eventual quirks
◦ equivalent 'legal' code
◦ All documented behaviour backed up by test code. The referenced test code can be
found in the VICE test-programs repository at
https://sourceforge.net/p/vice-emu/code/HEAD/tree/testprogs/
◦ examples for real world usage, if available

•

Some hints on using decimal mode in (not only) unintended ways

•

Description of the so called “dummy” memory accesses and some examples on how to
(ab)use them

•

A short description of all other unintended bugs and quirks of the CPU
