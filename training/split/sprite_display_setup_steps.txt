# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Steps required to display a sprite after placing shape data in memory and setting Sprite Data Pointer: enable sprite in Sprite Display Enable register ($D015 / 53269), set horizontal/vertical position registers ($D000-$D010 / 53248-53264), and set sprite color in Sprite Color Registers ($D027-$D02E / 53287-53294).

                          Even after the sprite shape data has been placed in memory, and the
                          Sprite Data Pointer has been set to display that block of data bytes
                          as the sprite shape, there are still several steps that must be taken
                          in order to display the sprite on the screen.

                          The proper bit of the Sprite Display Enable Register at 53269 ($D015)
                          must be set to 1 in order to turn on the sprite display.  A horizontal
                          and vertical screen position must be selected for the sprite by means
                          of the horizontal and vertical position registers (53248-53264,
                          $D000-$D010).  Finally, the color value of the sprite should be placed
                          in the appropriate Sprite Color Register (53287-53294, $D027-$D02E).
