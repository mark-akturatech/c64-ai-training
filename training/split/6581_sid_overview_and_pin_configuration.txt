  6581 SOUND INTERFACE DEVICE (SID)
  CHIP SPECIFICATIONS


  CONCEPT

    The 6581 Sound Interface Device (SID) is a single-chip, 3-voice elec-
  tronic music synthesizer/sound effects generator compatible with the 65XX
  and similar microprocessor families. SID provides wide-range, high-
  resolution control of pitch (frequency), tone color (harmonic content),
  and dynamics (volume). Specialized control circuitry minimizes software
  overhead, facilitating use in arcade/home video games and low-cost
  musical instruments.


  FEATURES

  o 3 AMPLITUDE MODULATORS
        Range: 48 dB
  o 3 ENVELOPE GENERATORS
        Exponential response

        Decay Rate: 6 ms-24 s
        Sustain Level: 0-peak volume
        Release Rate: 6 ms-24 s
  o OSCILLATOR SYNCHRONIZATION
  o RING MODULATION
  o PROGRAMMABLE FILTER
        Cutoff range: 30 Hz-12 kHz
