# 6502 Instruction Set - Rev. A 6502 'ROR bug' historical note: Rev A chips (Sep 1975–Jun 1976) lacked ROR implementation (not wired) resulting in an ASL-like behavior without carry update, and ROR being undocumented/illegal on Rev A. Introduction to WDC W65C02(S) extensions: CMOS static design, 69 instructions, 16 address modes, new address modes (zeropage indirect ($LL), absolute indexed indirect ($LLHH,X)), and behavioral changes. Mentions G65SC02 similarity but without bit-manipulation instructions.

                      These instructions freeze the CPU.
                      The processor will be trapped infinitely in T1 phase with
                      $FF on the data bus. — Reset required.
                      Instruction codes: 02, 12, 22, 32, 42, 52, 62, 72, 92, B2, D2, F2
                 Have a look at this table of the instruction layout in order to see how most of these
                 "illegal" instructions are a result of executing both instructions at c=1 and c=2 in
                 a given slot (same column, rows immediately above) at once.
                 Where c is the lowest two bits of the instruction code. E.g., "SAX abs", instruction
                 code $8F, binary 10001111, is "STA abs", 10001101 ($8D) and "STX abs", 10001110 ($8E).
          Rev. A 6502 (Pre-June 1976) "ROR Bug"
                 Famously, the Rev. A 6502 as delivered from September 1975 to June 1976 had a
                 "ROR bug". However, the "ROR" instruction isn't only missing from the original
                 documentation, as it turns out, the chip is actually missing crucial control lines,
                 which would have been required to make this instruction work. The instruction is
                 simply not implemented and it wasn't even part of the design. (This was actually
                 added on popular demand in Rev. B, as rumor has it, demand by Steve Wozniak. Even,
                 if not true, this makes for a good story. And how could there be a page on the 6502
                 without mentioning "Woz" once?) So, for all means, "ROR" is an undocumented or
                 "illegal" instruction on the Rev. A 6502.
                 And this is how ROR behaves on these Rev. A chips, much like ASL: it shifts all bits
                 to the left, shifting in a zero bit at the LSB side, but, unlike ASL, it does not
                 shift the high-bit into the carry. (So there are no connections to the carry at all.)
                 ROR  Rev. A (pre-June 1976)
                      As ASL, but does not update the carry.
                      N and Z flags are set correctly for the operation
                      performed.
