# COMMODORE 64 - Using the INPUT statement: explanation of variables as storage compartments for user input, difference between numeric and string variables (suffixes), examples demonstrating INPUT into variables and using them in calculations or PRINT statements, including prompts and concatenated print output; notes on message formatting and example programs.

      outside the range of +32767 thru -32768, the BASIC error message
      ?ILLEGAL QUANTITY will occur.



  USING THE INPUT STATEMENT

    Now that you know what variables are, let's take that information an
  put it together with the INPUT statement for some practical program-
  ming applications.
    In our first example, you can think of a variable as a "storage com-
  partment" where the Commodore 64 stores the user's response to your
  prompt question. To write a program which asks the user to type in a
  name, you might assign the variable N$ to the name typed in. Now
  every time you PRINT N$ in your program, the Commodore 64 will
  automatically PRINT the name that the user typed in.
    Type the word NEW on your Commodore 64. Hit the <RETURN> key
  and try this example:

    10 PRINT"YOUR NAME": INPUT N$
    20 PRINT"HELLO",N$

  In this example you used N to remind yourself that this variable stands
  for "NAME". The dollar sign ($) is used to tell the computer that you're
  using a string variable. It is important to differentiate between the two
  types of variables:

    1) NUMERIC
    2) STRING

    You probably remember from the earlier sections that numeric vari-
  ables are used to store number values such as 1, 100, 4000, etc. A
  numeric variable can be a single letter (A), any two letters (AB), a
  letter and a number (AI), or two letters and a number (AB1). You can save
  memory space by using shorter variables. Another helpful hint is to use
  letters and numbers for different categories in the same program (AI,
  A2, A3). Also, if you want whole numbers for an answer instead of
  numbers with decimal points, all you have to do is put a percent sign
  (%) at the end of your variable name (AB%, AI%, etc.)
  Now let's look at a few examples that use different types of variables
  and expressions with the INPUT statement.

    10 PRINT"ENTER A NUMBER": INPUT A
    20 PRINT A

    10 PRINT"ENTER A WORD": INPUT A$
    20 PRINT A$

    10 PRINT"ENTER A NUMBER": INPUT A
    20 PRINT A "TIMES 5 EQUALS" A*5
  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
  |   NOTE: Example 3 shows that MESSAGES or PROMPTS are inside the       |
  | quotation marks (" ") while the variables are outside. Notice, too,   |
  | that in line 20 the variable A was printed first, then the message    |
  | "TIMES 5 EQUALS", and then the calculation, multiply variable A by 5  |
  | (A*5).                                                                |
  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

    Calculations are important in most programs. You have a choice of using
  "actual numbers" or variables when doing calculations, but if you're
  working with numbers supplied by a user you must use numeric variables.
  Begin by asking the user to type in two numbers like this:

    10 PRINT"TYPE 2 NUMBERS": INPUT A: INPUT B

                                               BASIC PROGRAMMING RULES   19
