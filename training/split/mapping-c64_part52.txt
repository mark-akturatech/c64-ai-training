* For all modes, the screen border color is controlled by POKEing
location 53280 with the low nybble color value.

+ In exteded color mode, Bits 6 and 7 of each byte of screen memory
serve as the bit-pair controlling background color.  Because only Bits
0-5 are available for character selection, only characters with screen
codes 0-63 can be used in this mode.

++ In the bitmapped modes, the high and low nybble color values are
ORed together and POKEd into the same location in memory to control
the colors of the corresponding cell in the bitmap.  For example, to
control the colors of cell 0 of the bitmap, OR the high and low
nybbles and POKE the result into location 0 of screen memory.
