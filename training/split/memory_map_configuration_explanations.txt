# COMMODORE 64 - Detailed explanations of the numbered memory maps (1) through (9): what each configuration provides (default BASIC map, 60K RAM map, character ROM accessibility, softload languages map, full 64K RAM map, BASIC expansion ROM map, ROM-based app maps, and ULTIMAX video game memory map with note about expansion RAM access).

        (1)   This is the default BASIC memory map which provides
              BASIC 2.0 and 38K contiguous bytes of user RAM.

        (2)   This map provides 60K bytes of RAM and I/O devices.
              The user must write his own I/O driver routines.

        (3)   The same as 2, but the character ROM is not
              accessible by the CPU in this map.

        (4)   This map is intended for use with softload languages
              (including CP/M), providing 52K contiguous bytes of
              user RAM, I/O devices, and I/O driver routines.

        (5)   This map gives access to all 64K bytes of RAM. The
              I/O devices must be banked back into the processor's
              address space for any I/O operation.

        (6)   This is the standard configuration for a BASIC system
              with a BASIC expansion ROM. This map provides 32K
              contiguous bytes of user RAM and up to 8K bytes of
              BASIC "enhancement".

        (7)   This map provides 40K contiguous bytes of user RAM
              and up to 8K bytes of plug-in ROM for special ROM-
              based applications which don't require BASIC.

        (8)   This map provides 32K contiguous bytes of user RAM
              and up to 16K bytes of plug-in ROM for special
              applications which don't require BASIC (word
              processors, other languages, etc.).

        (9)   This is the ULTIMAX video game memory map. Note that
              the 2K byte "expansion RAM" for the ULTIMAX, if
              required, is accessed out of the COMMODORE 64 and
              any RAM in the cartridge is ignored.
