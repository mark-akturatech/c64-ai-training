# MACHINE - Introduces the distinction between signed and unsigned single-byte numbers. Explains programmer's choice, single-byte signed range (-128..+127) vs unsigned (0..255), and that the machine does not treat them differently except for how the programmer tests flags (e.g., N for sign).

Numbers:  Signed and Unsigned
-----------------------------

We have looked briefly at the question of signed versus unsigned numbers.
The most important concept is that you, the programmer, choose whether or not
a number is to be considered a signed number (for a single byte, in the
decimal range -128 to +127) or an unsigned integer (single-byte range 0 to
255).

It makes no difference to the computer.  If you consider a number signed, you
may wish to test the sign using the N flag.  If not, you won't do such a
test.
