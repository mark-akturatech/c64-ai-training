# A 256 Byte Autostart Fast Loader for the Commodore 64 - IEC handshake details: drive signals readiness by pulling CLK=0, C64 signals readiness by pulling both CLK and DATA low. After transfer both release lines. The drive's check loop timing (example: ldx $1800; bne wait_c64) yields up to 10 cycles delay before the C64 reads; the C64 delays exactly 10 cycles after signaling via PHA/PLA/BIT $00.


Handshake Protocol
------------------

Both devices signal readiness through the IEC bus:

  - Drive sets CLK=0 when ready to send
  - C64 sets both CLK and DATA to 0 when ready to receive
  - After transfer, both reset to not-ready state

Precise timing ensures the drive's check loop completes before the C64
starts reading:

    ldx $1800       ; 4 cycles
    bne wait_c64    ; 2-3 cycles (branch decision)
    ; maximum delay: 10 cycles before C64 reads

The C64 delays exactly 10 cycles after signaling readiness using
PHA/PLA/BIT $00.
