# ********* - Character ROM image seen by VIC-II when using memory bank 0 (locations 4096-8191 / $1000-$1FFF). Describes that VIC-II can see character ROM here while CPU sees RAM; explains that VIC-II banking (bank 0 default) can make RAM at these addresses inaccessible to CPU for character data and sprite blocks 64-127. Notes implications for bitmap mode and character shape sourcing.

A quick review of the BASIC pointers starting at 43 ($2B) reveals that
the layout of the BASIC program area (going from lower memory
addresses to higher) is as follows:

BASIC Program Text
Non-Array Variables and String Descriptors
Array Variables
Free Area (Reported by FRE(0))
String Text Area (Strings build from top of memory down into free area)
BASIC ROM

It is interesting to note that the NEW command does not zero out the
text area but rather replaces the first link address in the BASIC
program with two zeros, indicating the end of the program.  Therefore,
you can recover a program from a NEW by replacing the first link
adress, finding the address of the two zeros that actually mark the
end of the program, and setting the pointers at 45, 47, and 49 (which
all point to the end of a BASIC program before the program is RUN) to
the byte following these zeros.

Character ROM Image for VIC-II Chip When Using Memory Bank 0 (Default)

Though the VIC-II chip shares memory with the 6510 processor chip, it
does not always see that memory in exactly the same way as the main
microprocessor.

Although the 6510 accesses RAM at these locations, when the VIC-II is
banked to use the first 16K of RAM (which is the default condition),
it sees the character ROM here (the 6510 cannot access this ROM unless
it is switched into its memory at 49152 ($C000)).  This solves the
riddle of how the VIC-II chip can use the character ROM at 49152
($C000) for character shape data and RAM at 1024 ($400), when it can
only address memory within a 16K range.  It also means that the RAM at
4096-8191 cannot be used for screen display memory or user-defined
character dot data, and sprite data blocks 64-127 are not accessible.

You can verify this by turning on bitmap graphics with the screen
memory set to display addresses from 0 to 8192.  You will see that the
bottom portion of the screen shows all of the text character shapes
stored in the ROM.  For more information on the format of text
character data storage, see the description of the Character ROM at
49152 ($C000).
