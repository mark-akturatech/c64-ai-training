PET--Original ROM
-----------------

The first PET.  It can be recognized by the message seen at power up:

  *** COMMODORE BASIC ***

using asterisks but with no identifying number after the word BASIC.

The original machine may be upgraded to Upgrade ROM by fitting a new set of
ROM chips.  This is a good idea, since the original logic cannot handle disk,
does a poor job on cassette data files, has no built-in machine language
monitor, and has a zero page architecture that differs significantly from all
later PET/CBM's.  The BASIC language on this unit is also limited; arrays may
not contain over 256 elements, for example.

This early machine is becoming rare.
