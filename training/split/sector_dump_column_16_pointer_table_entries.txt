# byRiclianll - Lines contain the hex/byte dump rows dominated by the ':  16' column marker. This section lists repeated row markers and byte values for column 16, including hex identifiers (OA, OB, OC, OD, OE, OF) and sequential byte entries (01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 12, 09, etc.), plus interleaved numeric offsets/row labels (70, 78, 80, 88, 90). It represents the central pointer-table area where column-16 entries and their offsets are shown in the sector body.
