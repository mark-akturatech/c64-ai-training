# MACHINE - VIC/Commodore 64 uncrash notes: try holding RUN/STOP and tapping RESTORE; otherwise use a reset switch (available on some cartridge-motherboard accessories) to perform nondestructive reset (memory preserved). If monitor entry location is known, use appropriate SYS to recover monitor. Emphasizes nondestructive memory test on reset.

VIC/Commodore 64
----------------

You might try holding down the RUN/STOP key and tapping the RESTORE key to
see if that will bring the machine to its senses.  Otherwise, you must do a
more serious reset.

You must depend on the fact that the computer does a nondestructive memory
test during reset.  There are various commercially available interfaces for
the cartridge port--usually "mother boards" that are fitted with reset
switches.

When the reset switch is pressed, the computer starts from the beginning; but
memory is not disturbed.  If you have logged the entry location of the
machine language monitor, you can bring it back with the appropriate SYS
command.
