  SAVE"NAME"    Saves a program on tape
  LOAD"NAME",8  Loads a program from disk
  SAVE"NAME",8  Saves a program to disk

  PEEK(X)       Returns contents of memory location X
  POKE X,Y      Changes contents of location X to value Y
  SYS xxxxx     Jumps to execute a machine language program,
                starting at xxxxx
