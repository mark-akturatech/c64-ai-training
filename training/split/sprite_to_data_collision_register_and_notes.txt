# COMMODORE 64 - Sprite-to-data (sprite-to-background) collisions are detected in register 53279 ($D01F). Each sprite has a bit set to 1 if it collides with non-zero background data. Bits are latched until read (PEEK) which clears them. Note: multi-color data '01' is considered transparent for collisions even though it displays; when designing backgrounds make non-collision areas '01' in multicolor mode if needed.


  SPRITE TO DATA COLLISIONS

    Sprite to data collisions are detected in the sprite to data collision
  register at location 53279 ($D01F in HEX) of the VIC-II chip control
  register.
    Each sprite has a bit in this register. If that bit is a 1 , then that
  sprite is involved in a collision. The bits in this register remain set
  until read (PEEKed). Once read, the register is automatically cleared, so
  it is a good idea to save the value in a variable until you are finished
  with it.

  | NOTE: MULTI-COLOR data 01 is considered transparent for collisions,   |
  | even though it shows up on the screen. When setting up a background   |
  | screen, it is a good idea to make everything that should not cause a  |
  | collision 01 in multi-color mode.                                     |
