4.6 INITIALIZE

At times, an error condition on the disk will prevent you from
performing some operation you want to do.  The INITIALIZE command
returns the disk drive to the same state as when powered up.  You must
be careful to re-match the drive to the computer (see chapter 2).

FORMAT FOR INITIALIZE COMMAND:

   PRINT# 15, "INITIALIZE"

or abbreviated as

   PRINT# 15, "I"
