# byRiclianll - Section 4.5 heading and introduction: explains that PRG (program) files are the most common and designated by $82 in the directory. Diagrammatic description of the first sector in a PRG file: bytes 0-1 are forward pointer to next block, bytes 2-3 are the load address (lo-byte, hi-byte), bytes 4-255 hold the first 252 bytes of program data.


The  most  common  type  of  file  is  a  program  file,  PRG.  It  is  designated  by  an  $82  in  the 
directory.  Program  file  structure  is  quite  simple.  Diagrammatically,  the  first  sector  (block) 
in  a  program  file  looks  like  this.
