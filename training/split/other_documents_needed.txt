# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - References and recommended additional documents to study beyond this tutorial; encourages learning from demos and extracting techniques by inspection.

Other Documents
You'll need other documents, besides this little tutorial, or course. Below I list some references and some magazines with articles about demo coding.

Of course you'll also have to learn from the masters. When you watch a demo, try to figure out how the stuff you see on the screen is implemented, eg. what's done with chars and what's done with sprites, or where scrolling is used and where the graphics data is updated in realtime. See the URLs below for places where you can find demos.
