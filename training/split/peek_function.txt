# COMMODORE 64 - PEEK(location): returns integer 0–255 read from memory location (0–65535). Error ?ILLEGAL QUANTITY if out of range. Examples: reading border color at 53280 and reading BASIC variable table address using PEEK(45)+PEEK(46)*256.

  PEEK

  TYPE: Integer Function
  FORMAT: PEEK(<numeric>)

    Action: Returns an integer in the range of 0 to 255, which is read
  from a memory location. The <numeric> expression is a memory location

  error message ?ILLEGAL QUANTITY occurs.

  EXAMPLES of PEEK Function:

    10 PRINT PEEK(53280) AND 15   (Returns value of screen border color)

    5 A%=PEEK(45)+PEEK(46)*256    (Returns address of BASIC variable table)
