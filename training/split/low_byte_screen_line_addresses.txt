# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - Table of low bytes of screen line addresses (eight-bit low bytes). The high byte is derived from the page on which the screen starts. Notes that some PET models had an additional high-byte table. Lists the low bytes for successive screen lines.

                                *** LOW BYTE SCREEN LINE ADDRESSES
                                This is a table of the low bytes of screen line addresses.
                                The high byte of the addresses is obtained by derivation
                                from the page on which the screen starts. There was an
                                additional table of high byte addresses on the fixed
                                screen PETs.
