# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - CIA #2 Timer registers overview ($DD04-$DD07): four timer bytes (Timer A low/high, Timer B low/high) control CIA timers. The C64 OS primarily uses CIA #2 timers for RS-232 send/receive timing; Serial Bus uses CIA #1 Timer B.

$DD04-$DD07               Timer A and B Low and High Bytes

                          These four timer registers are used to control Timers A and B.  For
                          details on the operation of these timers, see the entry for Location
                          Range 56324-56327 ($DC04-$DC07).

                          The 64 Operating System uses the CIA #2 Timers A and B mostly for
                          timing RS-232 send and receive operations.  Serial Bus timing uses CIA
                          #1 Timer B.
