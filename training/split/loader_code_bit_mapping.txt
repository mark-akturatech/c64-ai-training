# Analyzing C64 tape loaders - Reports mapping of bit-0 and bit-1 waveform byte values observed in TAP file: Bit 0 byte = $36, Bit 1 byte = $65 (example from the analyzed TAP). Also mentions possible presence of trailer pulses in TAP file.

By looking at the TAP file, we can also say that:

<code>
Code:
Bit 0: $36
Bit 1: $65
</code>

A small analysis on the TAP file will also tell us if this loader uses any trailer pulse.\\
