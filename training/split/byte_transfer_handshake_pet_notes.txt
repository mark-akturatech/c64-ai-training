# Commodore IEC Serial Bus Protocol Reference - pagetable.com - IEEE-488 byte transfer mechanism: 3-wire handshake (NRFD, DAV, NDAC). PET-specific implementation notes: REN grounded, SRQ unused in software, default timeout (64 microseconds) and ability to disable via KERNAL SETTMO.

  Byte Transfer Mechanism:
    The protocol implements a 3-wire-handshake where receivers signal readiness
    (NRFD = 0), the sender places data on DIO and signals validity (DAV = 1),
    and receivers acknowledge acceptance (NDAC = 0).

  PET-Specific Implementation Notes:
    - REN remains grounded (logically true)
    - No software support for SRQ line
    - Default timeout implementation (64 microseconds) for sender/receiver ops
    - Timeouts can be disabled via KERNAL call SETTMO
