# 6502 Instruction Set - Overview of ADC (add with carry) and SBC (subtract with carry), the role of the carry flag for multi-byte arithmetic, and preparation steps (CLC before ADC, SEC before SBC). Example sequences for multi-byte (16-bit) addition and subtraction (load low byte, ADC/SBC low, store; then high byte chain). Note on CLD to force binary mode. Explanation of two's complement representation for signed values, how to form negatives (invert+1) and ranges of signed bytes (-128..+127), plus examples of signed arithmetic and how overflow and carry differ conceptually.

                   Indirect Jumps on Page Boundaries
                   Indirect JMP instructions with a look-up address low-byte of $FF (as in
                   $11FF) now execute as expected, but there's an extra cycle added to the
                   exuction time when address bytes are on different memory pages.
                 Behavioral Changes
                   Modified reset and interrupt sequence: the decimal flag is now reset (D=0)
                   and the processor set to binary mode.
                                                                  6502 Instruction Set
                   No undefinded opcodes (all unused instruction codes execute as NOPs,
                   instead).
                   For ADC and SBC N, V, and Z flags are set correctly in decimal mode, but
                   there is now an extra 1-cycle penalty for decimal mode with certain
                   instructions.
                   Indexed addressing across page boundaries now results in an extra read of
                   the last instruction byte, instead of the extra read of an invalid address
                   (NMOS).
                   Indirect jumps, fetching the address from the last byte of a page now fetch
                   the high-byte correctly from the next page. (E.g., "JMP ($11FF)" will fetch
                   the low-byte of the effective address from $11FF and the high-byte from
                   $1200. The NMOS version didn't increment the high-byte of the fetch address
                   in these cases.) An extra cycle is added in these cases.
                   Read-modify-write instructions do not write back the initial value to the
                   address (as with the NMOS 6502), but perform a dummy read instead. So there
                   are now two read cycles and one write cycle, while there were two write and
                   one read cycle on the NMOS 6502. (Caveat: for indexed addressing, this dummy
                   read is performed on the base address before indexing.)
                   Read-modify-write instructions with absolute indexed addresses that do not
                   cross page boundaries perform now in one cycle less (6 instead of 7 on the
                   NMOS CPU).
                   BRK instruction are fully executed before any interrupt. (On the NMOS
                   version, if an interrupt occured while a BRK instruction was fetching the
                   interupt vector, this would be overwritten and the interrupt executed,
                   instead.)
                   The signal on the RDY pin is now bidrectional. While it was just an input on
                   the NMOS version, it is now also pulled low by the WAI instruction.
          Rockwell R65000/11 •/12 •/15 Extensions
                 While the Rockwell R6500 family is very similar to the MOS 6502,
                 types /11, /12, and /15 add four instructions for bit manipulation,
                 which were later included in the WDC instruction set.
                 (Hence, these instructions are the same on the respective Rockwell
                 and WDC processors.)
                 Rockwell R6500 family processors also add additional interrupts,
                 registers and ports for I/O communication, counters, and
                 respective control registers. These are accessed and controlled
                 by reserved addresses and have no impact on the instruction set.
                 (See the respective datasheets for details.)

                 BBR  Branch on Bit Reset
                      This branch instruction tests a given bit of
                      the accumulator and branches, if this bit is
                      not set. This is an entire family of eight
                      instructions in total, testing one of bits #0
                      to #7, each. Individual mnemonics designate the
                      tested bit, as in BBRn, where n = 0..7.
                      As with all branch instructions, the address
                      mode is relative, taking a signed single-byte
                      offset as operand.
