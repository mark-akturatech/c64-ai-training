# Kick Assembler - Shows label scope behavior for .if directives. Placing a label before an .if creates access to labels defined only in the taken branch. If the condition is false and no else-branch exists, references to symbols in the taken branch raise 'symbol undefined'. Example: jmp myIf.label myIf: .if (true) { label: lda #0 } else { label: nop }

*=$8021 "Insert jump"
jmp $8044

Segments can also be used for outputting code in alternative formats. Here is an example writing code for a
cartridge with 4 banks:
.segment CARTRIDGE_FILE [outBin="myfile.bin"]
.segmentout [segments ="BANK1"]
.segmentout [segments ="BANK2"]
.segmentout [segments ="BANK3"]
.segmentout [segments ="BANK4"]
.segmentdef BANK1 [min=$1000, max=$1fff, fill]
.segmentdef BANK2 [min=$1000, max=$1fff, fill]
.segmentdef BANK3 [min=$1000, max=$1fff, fill]
.segmentdef BANK4 [min=$1000, max=$1fff, fill]
.segment BANK1
..code for segment 1 goes here...
