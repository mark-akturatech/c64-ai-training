# Contents - Video interrupts: VIRQ ($D019) holds interrupt status bits (raster, sprite-background collision, sprite-sprite collision, light pen, and a 'any enabled interrupt' flag). To clear an interrupt bit you must write a 1 to that bit. Interrupts are only signaled to the CPU if corresponding bits are set in the video interrupt mask register VIRQM ($D01A); however VIRQ can still be read even if VIRQM doesn't enable CPU interrupts.


VIDEO INTERRUPTS 

Different conditions within the VIC chip can 
generate interrupts. The interrupt status can be read 
by reading the video interrupts register, VIRQ 
($D019). The bits have the following meanings: 



Bit Type of Interrupt 

RASTER 

1 SPRITE TO BACKGROUND 
COLLISION 

2 SPRITE TO SPRITE COLLISION 

3 LIGHT PEN 

7 SET ON ANY ENABLED 
INTERRUPT 

Once an interrupt bit has been set, a 1 must be 
written to that bit position in order to clear it. This 
allows you to process interrupts one at a time, 
without having to store the data elsewhere. 

Interrupts will only be sent to the 
microprocessor if the corresponding bit in the video 
interrupt mask register, VIRQM ($D01A), is set. You 
will still be able to read the interrupts from the 
VIRQ register, but if the appropriate bit in the 
VIRQM register is not set, no interrupts will be 
generated. See the section on using interrupts for
