# MACHINE - Exercises and suggested projects: extend numeric/alphabetic acceptance, accept alphabetic characters only and modify high bit with ORA #$80 before printing, accept numeric digits only and AND #$FE before printing (ask what happens), reinforcing chapter concepts through practice.

Questions and Projects
----------------------

Write extra coding to allow both numeric and alphabetic characters, but
nothing else.

Write a program to accept only alphabetic characters.  As each ASCII
character is received, turn on its high bit with ORA #$80 and then print it.
How has the character been changed?

Write a program to accept only numeric digits.  As each ASCII character is
received, turn off its lowest bit with AND #$FE and then print it.  What
happens to the numbers?  Can you see why?
