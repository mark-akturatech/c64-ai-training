# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Initialise the RS232 output port and VIA settings: disables interrupts, programs VIA2 ICR, sets DTR/RTS outputs via VIA2 DDRB/DRB, ensures Tx data line is high by OR'ing VIA2 DRA, and clears the RS232 interrupt-enable byte at $02A1. Returns to caller.
