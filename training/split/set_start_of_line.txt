# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - Given X=line number, loads the low byte of the screen-line address from a ROM table and derives the high byte from the screen link table and HIBASE ($0288). Stores the computed low/high bytes into $D1/$D2 (current screen line address pointer).

                                *** SET START OF LINE
                                On entry, (X) holds the line number. The low byte of the
                                address is set from the ROM table, and the highbyte
                                derived from the screen link and HIBASE.
