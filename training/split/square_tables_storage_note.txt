# 6502 Multiplication and Division Algorithms - Source: llx.com - Notes that the square tables required for the square-table multiplication are too long to show in the document and are provided separately. Reminder that tables must be page-aligned or the (indirect),Y indexing won't work.

The tables necessary to make this work are too long to show here, so
I've provided them in a separate text file.
Remember, the tables have to be page-aligned, or the above code won't
work.


(The above routine is based on some code I found on a
Commodore-64-related web page, which, unfortunately, I haven't been able
locate again.  The method doesn't seem to have been widely known among
Apple II programmers.)
