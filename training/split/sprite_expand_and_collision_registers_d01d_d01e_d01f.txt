# ********* - Sprite Horizontal Expansion Register ($D01D) bits for doubling width; Sprite collision detection registers ($D01E Sprite-Sprite, $D01F Sprite-Foreground) explanation: reading clears latched collisions, rules for what causes collisions (only nonzero shape bits count; multicolor 01 bit-pair treated as background and doesn't cause collisions), collisions can happen off-screen and in border-covered areas.

these registers, you must multiply the value in the high byte by 8,
and add the value of the low three bits.  The range of cutoff
freqnencies represented by these 2048 values stretches from 30 Hz to
about 12,000 Hz.  The exact frequency may be calculated with the
formula:

FREQUENCY=(REGISTER VALUE*5.8)+30Hz

An additional element in filtering is the resonance control.  This
allows you to peak the volume of the frequency elements nearest the
cutoff frequency.

54293         $D415          CUTLO

Bits 0-2:  Low portion of filter cutoff frequency
Bits 5-7:  Unused

54294         $D416          CUTHI
Filter Cutoff Frequency (high byte)

54295         $D417          RESON
Filter Resonance Control Register

Bit 0:  Filter the output of voice 1?  1=yes
Bit 1:  Filter the output of voice 2?  1=yes
Bit 2:  Filter the output of voice 3?  1=yes
Bit 3:  Filter the output from the external input?  1=yes
Bits 4-7:  Select filter resonance 0-15

Bits 0-3 are used to control which of the voices will be altered by
the filters.  If one of these bits is set to 1, the corresponding
voice will be processed through the filter, and its harmonic content
will be changed accordingly.  If the bit is set to 0, the voice will
pass directly to the audio output.  Note that there is also a
provision for processing an external audio signal which is brought
through pin 5 of the Audio/Video Port.

Bits 4-7 control the resonance of the filter.  By placing a number
from 0 to 15 in these four bits, you may peak the volume of those
frequencies nearest the cutoff.  This creates an even sharper
filtering effect.  A setting of 0 causes no resonance, while a setting
of 15 gives maximum resonance.

54296         $D418          SIGVOL
Volume and Filter Select Register

Bits 0-3:  Select output volume (0-15)
Bit 4:  Select low-pass filter, 1=low-pass on
Bit 5:  Select band-pass filter, 1=band-pass on
Bit 6:  Select high-pass filter, 1=high-pass on
Bit 7:  Disconnect output of voice 4, 1=voice 3 off

Bits 0-3 control the volume of all outputs.  The possible volume
levels range from 0 (no volume) to 15 (maximum volume).  Some level of
volume must be set here before any sound can be heard.

Bits 4-6 control the selection of the low-pass, band-pass, or
high-pass filter.  A 1 in any of these bits turns the corresponding
filter on.  These filters can be combined, although only one cutoff
frequency can be chosen.  In order for the filter to have any effect,
at least one of the voices must be routed through it using the Filter
Resonance Control Register at 54295 ($D417).

When Bit 7 is set to 1,  it disconnects the output of voice 3.  This
allows you to use the output of the oscillator for modulating the
frequency of the other voices, or for generating random number,
without any undesired audio output.

Game Paddle Inputs

These registers allow you to read the game paddles that plug into
joystick Controller Ports 1 and 2.  Each paddle uses a variable
resistor (also known as a potentiometer or pot), whose resistance is
controlled by turning a knob.  The varying resistance is used to vary
the voltage to two pins of the SID chip between 0 and +5 volts.
Analog-to-digital (A/D) converters in the chip interpret these voltage
levels as binary values and store the values in these registers.
These registers return a number from 0 (minumum resistance) to 255
(maximum resistance) for each paddle in either of the ports, depending
on the position of the paddle knob.

Since these registers will read the paddle values for only one
controller port, there is a switching mechanism which allows you to
select which of the two ports to read.  By writing a bit-pair of 01
(bit value of 64) to the last two bits of CIA #1 Data Port A (56320,
$DC00), you select the paddles on joystick Controller Port 1.  By
writing a bit-pair of 10 (bit value of 128), you select the paddles on
Controller Port 2.

If you look at the description of Data Port A (56320, $DC00), however,
you will notice that it is also used in the keyboard scanning process.
By writing to this port, you determine which keyboard column will be
read.

Since the IRQ interrupt keyboard scan routine and the routine that
checks for the STOP key are putting values into this location 60 times
per second, you cannot reliable select the pair of paddles you wish to
read from BASIC without first turning off the keyboard IRQ.  This can
be done with a POKE 56333,127.  You can then read the paddles with the
