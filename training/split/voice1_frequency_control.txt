# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $D400-$D401 Voice 1 Frequency Control (low/high bytes): 16-bit frequency range and formula FREQUENCY = (REGISTER VALUE * CLOCK / 16777216) Hz; given NTSC clock ~1022730 yields FREQUENCY = REGISTER_VALUE * 0.060959458 Hz. Explains combining low and high bytes (value = low + 256*high).

$D400-$D401               Voice 1 Frequency Control

                          Together, these two locations control the frequency or pitch of the
                          musical output of voice 1.  Some frequency must be selected in order
                          for voice 1 to be heard.  This frequency may be changed in the middle
                          of a note to achieve special effects.  The 16-bit range of the
                          Frequency Control Register covers over eight full octaves, and allows
                          you to vary the pitch from 0 (very low) to about 4000 Hz (very high),
                          in 65536 steps.  The exact frequency of the output can be determined
                          by the equation

                          FREQUENCY=(REGISTER VALUE*CLOCK/16777216)Hz

                          where CLOCK equals the system clock frequency, 1022730 for American
                          (NTSC) systems, 985250 for European (PAL), and REGISTER VALUE is the
                          combined value of these frequency registers.  That combined value
                          equals the value of the low byte plus 256 times the value of the high
                          byte.  Using the American (NTSC) clock value, the equation works out
                          to

                          FREQUENCY=REGISTER VALUE*.060959458 Hz
