The Commodore Peripheral Bus family spans from 1977 to 1991, covering these
variants:

  Part 1: IEEE-488         [PET/CBM Series; 1977]
  Part 2: The TALK/LISTEN Layer (bus arbitration, shared across all variants)
  Part 3: The Commodore DOS Layer (file system, shared across all variants)
  Part 4: Standard Serial (IEC)  [VIC-20, C64; 1981]
  Part 5: TCBM             [C16, C116, Plus/4; 1984]
  Part 6: JiffyDOS         [1985]
  Part 7: Fast Serial      [C128; 1986]
  Part 8: CBDOS            [C65; 1991]
