# Contents - Continued diagram material including address labels (e.g., FFFF, E000, D000, C000, $8000) and annotations for KERNAL ROM, I/O, 4K RAM, 16K RAM, and the LORAM/HIRAM control bits. Includes the caption for Figure 7-3 (presented as 'Fig. 7-3. 52K RAM memory map' in the OCR text) showing an alternate memory configuration where ROM and I/O occupy the top region and lower RAM regions are indicated.
