# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Wrapper at $FFD5 that JMPs to $F49E to load RAM from a device (or verify). Accumulator=0 for load, 1 for verify. SETLFS and SETNAM must be called first. Returns highest loaded RAM address.

                                *** load RAM from a device
                                this routine will load data bytes from any input device directly into the memory
                                of the computer. It can also be used for a verify operation comparing data from a
                                device with the data already in memory, leaving the data stored in RAM unchanged.
                                The accumulator must be set to 0 for a load operation or 1 for a verify. If the
                                input device was OPENed with a secondary address of 0 the header information from
                                device will be ignored. In this case XY must contain the starting address for the
                                load. If the device was addressed with a secondary address of 1 or 2 the data will
                                load into memory starting at the location specified by the header. This routine
                                returns the address of the highest RAM location which was loaded.
                                Before this routine can be called, the SETLFS, $FFBA, and SETNAM, $FFBD,
                                routines must be called.
