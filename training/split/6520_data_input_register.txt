# MACHINE - 6520 Data Input Register behavior: when the CPU writes data to the PIA, the data on the bus is latched into the Data Input Register and transferred into internal registers to ensure glitch-free transitions on peripheral output lines; this makes transitions smooth and maintains stable voltages on outputs except when changing state.

Data Input Register
-------------------

When a microprocessor writes data into the 6520, the data which appears on
the data bus is latched into the Data Input Register.  It is then transferred
into one of six internal register of the 6520.  This assures that the data on
the peripheral output lines will not "glitch," i.e., the output lines will
make smooth transitions from high to low or from low to high and the voltage
will remain stable except when it is going to the opposite polarity.
