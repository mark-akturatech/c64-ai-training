# Kick Assembler - Explains registering plugins: ensure compiled Java class is visible on Java classpath. Two ways to tell Kick Assembler about plugin: use .plugin directive (e.g., .plugin "test.plugins.macros.MyMacro") for project-specific or add fully qualified class names to KickAss.plugin file for global availability.
