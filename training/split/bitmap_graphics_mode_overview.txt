# ********* - Bitmap (hi-res) graphics mode enabled by Bit 5 of $D011: 320x200 dots, 1 bit per dot; mapping of bitmap and color memory within VIC-II 16K bank controlled by $D018; multicolor bitmap variations, color memory requirements (1K), differences from text mode layout.

display area, and a position 355 ($158) the whole sprite has moved out
of sight, off the right edge of the screen.

These registers are all intialized to 0 at power-up.

Most Significant Bits of Sprites 0-7 Horizontal Position

Bit 0:  Most significant bit of Sprite 0 horizontal position
Bit 1:  Most significant bit of Sprite 1 horizontal position
Bit 2:  Most significant bit of Sprite 2 horizontal position
Bit 3:  Most significant bit of Sprite 3 horizontal position
Bit 4:  Most significant bit of Sprite 4 horizontal position
Bit 5:  Most significant bit of Sprite 5 horizontal position
Bit 6:  Most significant bit of Sprite 6 horizontal position
Bit 7:  Most significant bit of Sprite 7 horizontal position

Setting one of these bites to 1 adds 256 to the horizontal position of
the corresponding sprite.  Resetting one of these bits to 0 restricts
the horizontal position of the corresponding sprite to a value of 255
or less

53265         $D011          SCROLY
Vertical Fine Scrolling and Control Register

Bits 0-2:  Fine scroll display vertically by X scan lines (0-7)
Bit 3:  Select a 24-row or 25-row text display (1=25 rows, 0=24 rows)
Bit 4:  Blank the entire screen to the same color as the background
  (0=blank)
Bit 5:  Enable bitmap graphics mode (1=enable)
Bit 6:  Enable extended color text mode (1=enable)
Bit 7:  High bit (Bit 8) of raster compare register at 53266 ($D012)

This is one of the two important multifunction control registers on
the VIC-II chip.  Its defaule value is 155, which sets the high bit of
the raster compare to 1, selects a 25-row display, disables the
blanking feature, and uses a vertical scrolling offset of three scan
lines.

Bits 0-2.  These bits control vertical fine scrolling of the screen
display.  This feature allows you to move the entire text display
smoothly up and down, enabling the display area to act as a window,
scrolling over a larger text or character graphics display.

Since each row of text is eight scan lines high, if you simply move
each line of text up one row, the characters travel an appreciable
distance each time they move, which gives the motion a jerky quality.
This is called coarse scrolling, and you can see an example of it when
LISTing a program that is too long to fit on the screen all at one
time.

By placing a number from 1 to 7 into these three bits, you can move
