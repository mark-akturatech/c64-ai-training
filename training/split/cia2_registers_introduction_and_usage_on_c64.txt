# ********* - Overview of CIA #2 (56576-56591 $DD00-$DD0F). CIA #2 is identical in chip function to CIA #1 but on C64 is used for Serial Bus, RS-232, and the User Port. Data Port A selects the 16K bank of VIC-II memory for video. CIA #2's interrupt line is wired to the 6510 NMI line (not IRQ), so its interrupts cannot be masked by SEI; use the NMI vector for routines driven by this chip.

Complex Interface Adapter (CIA) #2 Registers

Locations 56576-56591 ($DD00-$DD0F) are used to address the Complex
Interface Adapter chip #2 (CIA #2).  Since the chip itself is
identical to CIA #1, which is addressed at 56320 ($DC00), the
discussion here will be limited to the use which the 64 makes of this
particular chip.  For more general information on the chip registers,
please see the corresponding entries for CIA #1.

One of the significant differences between CIA chips #1 and #1 is the
use to which Data Ports A and B are put.  The peripheral input and
output devices that CIA #2 controls are those on the Serial Bus (such
as the 1541 Disk Drive and 1525 printer), the RS-232 device (which is
used for telecommunications), and the User Port, an eight-bit parallel
port that can be turned to whatever purpose the user desires.  In
addition, Data Port A has the important task of selecting the 16K bank
ofmemory that will be used by the VIC-II chip for graphics.

Another significant difference between CIA chips #1 and #2 is that the
interrupt line of CIA #1 is wired to the 6510 IRQ line, while that of
CIA #2 is wired to the NMI line.  This means that interrupts from this
chip cannot be masked by setting the Interrupt disable flag (SEI).
They can be disabled from CIA's Mask Register, though.  Be sure to use
the NMI vector when setting up routines to be driven by interrupts
generated by this chip.
