# NMOS 6510 - Introduces unintended memory accesses on the 6502 (every cycle is a memory access; some are dummy fetches) and covers dummy-fetch behavior for single-byte and accumulator addressing-mode instructions. Notes that single-byte instructions fetch PC+1 after the opcode and shows the accumulator-operation listing (ASL, LSR, ROL, ROR) with the associated opcode-fetch / PC+1 dummy fetch cycle diagram and the '(*) fetch after opcode' remark.

Unintended memory accesses
Due to how the 6502 works internally, every execution cycle is always a memory access – either
read or write. In some cases those accesses are “dummies” and are not related to what the
instruction is actually supposed to do. Usually these accesses can be ignored, however they can also
be (ab)used and sometimes they may cause unwanted side effects, eg when dealing with I/O
registers.

Dummy fetches
Single byte instructions
Single byte instructions will always fetch the PC+1 after the opcode fetch (like any other
instruction).
