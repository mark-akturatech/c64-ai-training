# NMOS 6510 - Header and explanation for the ARR flag-mapping table. Includes column labels for 'Input before ROR' (Carry, Bit 7, Bit 6) and 'Output' (Bit 7, Bit 6, Carry, Overflow), and the formulas that define each resulting output/flag in terms of the inputs: Output Bit 7 = Input Bit 7; Output Bit 6 = Input Bit 7 ^ Input Bit 6; Output Carry = Input Carry; Output Overflow = Input Bit 7.

Input before ROR
Carry

Bit 7

Output

Bit 6

Carry

Overflow

Bit 7

Bit 6

= Input Bit 7

= Input Bit 7 ^ Input Bit 6

= Input Carry

= Input Bit 7
