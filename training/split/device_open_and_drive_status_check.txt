# byRiclianll - Drive I/O setup and status check: OPEN 15,8,15 to the 1541, send the '10' (status) command with PRINT#15, read the drive response via INPUT#15 into EN*, EM*, ET*, ES*, test for EN* = "00" (OK) and handle/report errors, then CLOSE 15 and END if a fatal error occurs. This chunk ensures the drive is ready before destructive actions.
