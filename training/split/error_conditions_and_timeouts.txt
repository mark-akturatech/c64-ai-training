# Commodore IEC Serial Bus Protocol Reference - pagetable.com - IEC error conditions and timeouts: device-not-present (DATA remains unpulled after 256 µs), receiver timeout (no DATA pull within 1000 µs after byte sent), sender timeout (CLK not pulled within 512 µs for empty stream).

Error Conditions and Timeouts:
  Device not present:  DATA remains unpulled after 256 microseconds
  Receiver timeout:    No DATA pull within 1000 microseconds after byte sent
  Sender timeout:      CLK not pulled within 512 microseconds (empty stream)
