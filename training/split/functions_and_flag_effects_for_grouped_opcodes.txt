# NMOS 6510 - Gives the high-level functional semantics for the grouped undocumented opcodes (e.g., {addr} = {addr} * 2, A = A or {addr}, {addr} = rol {addr}, A = A and {addr}, etc., lines 1327–1335). Lists the processor status flag columns (N V - B D I Z C) and the observed/affected flag behavior for each function (1337–1355). Continues with additional functions for SAX/LAX/DCP/ISC variants (1356–1363) and their flag effects (1365–1378). This chunk maps the opcode groups to what they do and how they affect CPU flags.
