# ********* - Mechanical/file-level drive test: prints 'drive pass' and starts 'mechanical test'; sets tt, opens a sequential file for writing on the drive (OPEN 2,8,2,"0:test file,s,w"), calls the I/O status routine for open (GOSUB 1840), invokes the write-data routine (ch=2; GOSUB 1930), closes via status messages (GOSUB 1840), reopens for reading (OPEN ... "s,r"), calls the read-data routine (GOSUB 1990), then issues a scratch file command (PRINT#1,"s0:test file") and reports the scratch with GOSUB 1840.
