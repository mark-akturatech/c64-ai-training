# C64 KERNAL API (Lee Davison) - $FF99 — Read/Set the top of memory. With carry=1 loads pointer to top-of-RAM into X/Y; with carry=0 saves X/Y as the top-of-memory pointer, changing available RAM top.

$FF99          read/set the top of memory
               
               This routine is used to read and set the top of RAM. When this routine is called
               with the carry bit set the pointer to the top of RAM will be loaded into XY. When
               this routine is called with the carry bit clear XY will be saved as the top of
               memory pointer changing the top of memory.
