# byRiclianll - Final portion of TRACK 17 SECTOR 11 containing DO-/FO-style labels, repeated placeholder bytes, short ASCII fragments (examples include partial strings resembling 'MOR' / 'TGAGE' / 'TGAGE...' depending on alignment), sequences like 82 05 02 followed by ASCII-like runs, and final zero-padding and trailing sector bytes. This chunk represents the tail of the sector: small labeled blocks, miscellaneous data fragments and filler that close out the sector dump.
