# COMMODORE 64 - NEW: deletes program in memory and clears all variables. Advises using NEW in direct mode before typing a new program. Warns of trouble debugging if NEW used inside program (erases everything). Examples.

  NEW

  TYPE: Command
  FORMAT: NEW

    Action: The NEW command is used to delete the program currently in
  memory and clear all variables. Before typing in a new program, NEW
  should be used in direct mode to clear memory. NEW can also be used in
  a program, but you should be aware of the fact that it will erase
  everything that has gone before and is still in the computer's memory.
  This can be particularly troublesome when you're trying to debug your
  program.

  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | BE CAREFUL: Not clearing out an old program before typing a new one   |
  | can result in a confusing mix of the two programs.                    |
  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

  EXAMPLES of NEW Command:

    NEW             (Clears the program and all variables)
    10 NEW          (Performs a NEW operation and STOPs the program.)
