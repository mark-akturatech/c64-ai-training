# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Wrapper at $FFB4 that JMPs to $ED09 to command a device on the serial bus to TALK. Accumulator must hold device number (4..30).

                                *** command serial bus device to TALK
                                to use this routine the accumulator must first be loaded with a device number
                                between 4 and 30. When called this routine converts this device number to a talk
                                address. Then this data is transmitted as a command on the Serial bus.
