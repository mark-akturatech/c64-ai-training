# MACHINE - Using multiple bytes to hold larger numbers; carry flag signals overflow from lower bytes; programmer must write code to handle multi-byte arithmetic and carries.


Big Numbers:  Multiple Bytes
----------------------------

You may use more than one byte to hold a number.  Again, it's your decision.
If you think the numbers may go up to a million, you might allocate three
bytes (or more or fewer).  If you are doing arithmetic on multi-byte numbers,
the computer will help you by signaling in the carry flag that there's
something to be carried across from a lower byte to a higher one.  But it's
up to you to write the code to handle the extra bytes.
