    The two open I/O slots are for general purpose user I/O, special pur-
  pose I/O cartridges (such as IEEE), and have been tentatively designated
  for enabling the Z-80 cartridge (CP/M option) and for interfacing to a
  low-cost high-speed disk system.
    The system provides for "auto-start" of the program in a Commodore 64
  Expansion Cartridge. The cartridge program is started if the first nine
  bytes of the cartridge ROM starting at location 32768 ($8000) contain
  specific data. The first two bytes must hold the Cold Start vector to be
  used by the cartridge program. The next two bytes at 32770 ($8002) must
  be the Warm Start vector used by the cartridge program. The next three
  bytes must be the letters, CBM, with bit 7 set in each letter. The last
  two bytes must be the digits "80" in PET ASCII.


  COMMODORE 64 MEMORY MAPS

    The following table lists the various memory configurations available
  on the COMMODORE 64, the states of the control lines which select each
  memory map, and the intended use of each map.
    The leftmost column of the table contains addresses in hexadecimal
  notation. The columns aside it introduce all possible memory
  configurations. The default mode is on the left, and the absolutely most
  rarely used Ultimax game console configuration is on the right. Each
  memory configuration column has one or more four-digit binary numbers as
  a title. The bits, from left to right, represent the state of the /LORAM,
  /HIRAM, /GAME and /EXROM lines, respectively. The bits whose state does
