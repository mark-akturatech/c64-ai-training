# ********* - SIGN (put sign of FAC1 into .A: 0 for zero, 1 for positive, 255 for negative), SGN (convert sign into a floating point number in FAC1), ABS (make FAC1 positive), and FCOMP (compare FAC1 to a five-byte floating point number in memory, returning 0/1/255 in .A). Covers sign extraction, sign-to-FP conversion, absolute value, and comparison semantics.

48171         $BC2B          SIGN
Put the Sign of Accumulator #1 into .A Register

On exit from this routine the Accumulator will hold a 0 if FAC1 is 0,
a 1 if it is positive, and a value of 255 ($FF) if it is negative.

48185         $BC39          SGN
Perform SGN

The SGN routine calls the above routine to put the sign of FAC1 into
.A, and then converts that value into a floating point number in FAC1.

48216         $BC58          ABS
Perform ABS

The FAC1 sign byte at 102 ($66) is shifted right by this command, so
that the top bit is a 0 (positive).

48219         $BC5B          FCOMP
Compare FAC1 to Memory

On entry to this routine, .A and .Y point to a five-byte floating
point number to be compared to FAC1.  After the comparison, .A holds 0
if the two are equal, a 1 if the value of FAC1 is greater than that in
the memory location, and 255 ($FF) if the value of FAC1 is less than
that in the memory location.
