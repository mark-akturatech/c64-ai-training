# ca65 Users Guide - The -o name option: set the output file name. By default the output is the input filename with extension replaced by .o and placed in the same directory as source; -o supplies an explicit path/name.

-o name
The default output name is the name of the input file with the extension replaced by ".o". If you don't like that, you may give another name with the -o option. The output file will be placed in the same directory as the source file, or, if -o is given, the full path in this name is used.
