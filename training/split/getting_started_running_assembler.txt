# Kick Assembler - Chapter 2 intro and section 2.1: How to run Kick Assembler on Java 8+, basic command line usage (java -jar kickass.jar myCode.asm) and checking Java installation.

Chapter 2
Getting Started
This chapter is written to quickly get you started using Kick Assembler. The details of the assembler's functionalities will be presented later.

2.1. Running the Assembler
Kick Assembler run on any platform with Java8.0 or higher installed. Java can be downloaded for free on
Javas website (http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp). To assemble the file myCode.asm simply go to a command
prompt and write:
java –jar kickass.jar myCode.asm

And that's it.
Having problems with Java? Some Windows users found that Java couldn't be reached from the command
prompt after installation. If this is the case you have to insert it in your path environment variable. You can test
it by writing:
java –version

Java will now display the Java version if it's correctly installed.
