# Kick Assembler - Section 5.2: .if directive behavior — executing a following directive or a block {..} based on a boolean expression, .else blocks, examples for conditional code generation and error handling with .error inside .if/.else.


And are used like this:
.var allTrue = 10HigherThan100 && aEqualsB // Is true if the two boolean
// arguments are true.

Like in languages like C++ or Java, the && and || operators are short circuited. This means that if the first
argument of an && operator is false, then the second argument won't be evaluated since the result can only be
false. The same happens if the first argument of an || operator is true.

5.2. The .if directive
If-directives work like in standard programming languages. With an .if directive you have the proceeding directive executed only if a given boolean expression is evaluated to true. Here are some examples:
// Set x to 10 if x is higher that 10
.if (x>10) .eval x=10
// Only show rastertime if the ‘showRasterTime’ boolean is true
.var showRasterTime = false
.if (showRasterTime) inc $d020
jsr PlayMusic
.if (showRasterTime) dec $d020

You can group several statements together in a block with {…} and have them executed together if the boolean
expression is true:
// If IrqNr is 3 then play the music
.if (irqNr==3) {
inc $d020
jsr music+3
dec $d020
}

By adding an else statement you can have an expression executed if the boolean expression is false:
// Add the x’th entry of a table if x is positive or
// subtract it if x is negative
.if (x>=0) adc zpXtable+x else sbc zpXtable+abs(x)

// Init an offset table or display a warning if the table length is exceeded
.if (i<tableLength) {
lda #0
sta offset1+i
sta offset2+i
} else {
.error "Error!! I is too high!"
}

Additional information can be found by searching:
- "ternary_if_question_mark" which expands on short conditional expression form (condition ? trueExpr : falseExpr)
- "console_output_and_error_reporting" which expands on using .error and .errorif together with conditionals
