# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - CLEAR ATN: Clears the ATN (attention) line on the serial bus so subsequent data is not interpreted as a command. Reads serial port at $DD00, AND# $F7 to clear bit 4 (ATN high/false), writes back to $DD00, and returns (RTS).

                                *** CLEAR ATN
                                The ATN, attention, line on the serial bus is set to 1,
                                ie. ATN is now false and data sent on the serial bus will
                                not be interpreted as a command.
