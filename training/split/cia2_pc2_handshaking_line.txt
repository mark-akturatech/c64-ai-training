# ********* - Describes CIA #2 PC2 handshaking line: it is accessible from the User Port and goes low for one cycle following a read or write of CIA #2 Port B. It signals external devices when data has been read or written.

One of the handshaking lines on the above chart, PC2, was not covered
in the discussion of CIA #1, because that line of CIA #1 is not
connected to anything.  The CIA #2 PC line is accessible from the User
Port, however.  This line will go low for one cycle following a read
or write of Port B on CIA #2.  This signal lets external devices know
when data has been read or written.
