# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Optimization overview for demo coding: keep screen updating each frame, optimize per-iteration cycle counts, prefer algorithmic improvements and then instruction-level optimizations for effects where computations exceed frame time.

A Few Words About Optimization
As a general rule of thumb, you want the screen to be updated each frame, even if you do effects that use complex computations. With some effects, this isn't trivial. If you've written a nice effect, but the computations take more raster time than what's available in one frame, you have to optimize your code, or live with an effect that doesn't look as nice as it could have.


What to Optimize
There's a lot to be said about optimization, and I can't cram it all into a document like this. Furthermore, not every optimization is applicable to C-64 code.

If you ask a computer scientist, he or she will tell you that you should first improve your algorithms, and then, if it's still necessary, improve the constant times that each iteration takes. This makes perfect sense, if you want to sort 10000 numbers, you shouldn't spend time optimizing your bubble sort routine, but instead implement some faster algorithm, like quick sort or merge sort.

But the algorithm usually isn't the problem with demo effects. The algorithm itself is most of the time pretty straightforward, and the problem is to get each computation as fast as possible. There's no way to decrease the number of iterations, but instead you have to decrease the time each iteration takes. This is the common case, I'd say, but there are lots of exceptions.
