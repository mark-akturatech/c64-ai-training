# byRiclianll - Begins section 7.3: Description of DOS error messages. Introduces the order in which errors are evaluated by the DOS during a read (and the subsequent write table): table headers for READ ERRORS including columns for FDC job request, FDC error code, IP error code, and the resulting error message. Starts listing specific seek/read entries and corresponding codes.
