# MACHINE - Absolute addressing specifies a full 16-bit memory address ($0000-$FFFF) and accesses a single memory location. JSR and JMP use absolute addressing. Limitations: absolute reaches one fixed location only (no range).

A Single Address:  Absolute Mode
--------------------------------

An instruction might specify any address within memory--from $0000 to $FFFF--
and handle information from that address.  Giving the full address is called
absolute addressing; if you like, you can deal with information absolutely
anywhere in memory.

We have used absolute addresses several times.  When we exchanged the
contents of memory locations $0380 and $0381, we named these addresses as we
used them.  When we stored a value from the keyboard, we named location
$03C0.  We have also used absolute addresses for program control:
subroutines at $FFD2 and $033C were called up simply by giving the address.

The JSR (jump subroutine) instruction calls up a subroutine anywhere in
memory by using absolute addressing.  There is also a JMP (jump) instruction,
which can transfer program execution to any location in memory; it's similar
to the BASIC GOTO statement.  JMP can use absolute addressing--it can go
anywhere.

There's a limitation to absolute addressing, however.  Once you have written
the instruction, you can go only to the address stated.  You cannot reach a
range of locations; only one.

                                                                         :76:

One-location addressing can be good for any of several jobs.  On the PET/CBM,
we might want to switch between text and graphics modes by manipulating
address 59468 (hexadecimal E84C).  On the VIC-20, we might like to set the
volume level of the sound generator by placing a value into location 36878
(hex 900E).  On a Commodore 64, the screen's background color can be changed
by manipulating address 53281 (hex D021).  In each case, it's one specific
address that we want; absolute addressing will do the job for us.  And we
will also use absolute addressing to reference the various RAM locations that
we have picked for our own program "variables."
