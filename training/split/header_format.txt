# A Minimal C64 Datasette Program Loader - File header format (192 bytes, recorded and encoded like any file with leader and countdown). Header layout: Offset 0 file type (1 byte, $01 or $03 for PRG), Offset 1..2 start address (low/high), Offset 3..4 end address (low/high), Offset 5..20 filename (16 bytes), Offset 21..191 unused. Header types: $01 relocatable BASIC, $03 non-relocatable (ML).

A 192-byte header precedes each file. The header itself is encoded exactly
like a 192 byte file and recorded just before the file data: with a leader
and a countdown.
