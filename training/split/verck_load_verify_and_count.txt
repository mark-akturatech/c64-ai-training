# ********* - VERCK ($0A) and COUNT ($0B) usage: VERCK is a flag set by BASIC (0 for LOAD, 1 for VERIFY) passed to the Kernal LOAD routine; COUNT is used as an index into the BASIC input buffer at $200 during tokenization and also stores the number of array subscripts when building or referencing arrays. Explains how COUNT ends up equal to the tokenized line length after conversion.

10            $A             VERCK
Flag: LOAD or VERIFY

BASIC uses one Kernal routine to perform either the LOAD or VERIFY
function, depending on whether the Accumulator (.A) is set to 0 or 1
upon entry to the routine.  BASIC sets the value of VERCK to 0 for a
LOAD, or 1 for a VERIFY.  Its contents are passed to the Kernal LOAD
routine, which in turn stores it in location 147 ($93).

11            $B             COUNT
Index into the Text Input Buffer/Number of Array Subscripts

The routines that convert the text in the input buffer at 512 ($200)
into lines of executable program tokes, and the routines that link
these program lines together, use this location as an index into the
input buffer area.  When the job of converting text to tokens is
finished, the value in this location is equal to the length of the
tokenized line.

The routines which build an array or locate an element in an array use
this location to calculate the number of DIMensions called for and the
amount of storage required for a newly created array, or the number of
subscripts specified when referencing an array element.
