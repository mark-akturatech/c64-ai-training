# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Wrapper at $FFD8 that JMPs to $F5DD to save RAM to a device. Uses indirect page-zero address and XY target address. SETLFS/SETNAM required; special notes for device 1 (cassette).

                                *** save RAM to a device
                                this routine saves a section of memory. Memory is saved from an indirect address
                                on page 0 specified by A, to the address stored in XY, to a logical file. The
                                SETLFS, $FFBA, and SETNAM, $FFBD, routines must be used before calling this
                                routine. However, a file name is not required to SAVE to device 1, the cassette.
                                Any attempt to save to other devices without using a file name results in an error.
                                NOTE: device 0, the keyboard, and device 3, the screen, cannot be SAVEd to. If
                                the attempt is made, an error will occur, and the SAVE stopped.
