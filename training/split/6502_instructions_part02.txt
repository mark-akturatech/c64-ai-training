          Registers
            PC .... program counter              (16 bit)
            AC .... accumulator                   (8 bit)
                                                                 6502 Instruction Set
             X .... X register                    (8 bit)
             Y .... Y register                    (8 bit)
             SR .... status register [NV-BDIZC]   (8 bit)
             SP .... stack pointer                (8 bit)
          Note: The status register (SR) is also known as the P register,
          the accumulator (AC) as just A, the stack pointer (SP) as S, and
          X and Y registers as XR and YR, respectively.
          Contemporary machine language monitors (here, Commodore PET) show
          them typically like,
              B*
                   PC IRQ SR AC XR YR SP
              .;  0401 E62E 32 04 5E 00 F8
              .
          ("IRQ" is not a register, but the interrupt request vector, see below.)
            The accumulator is the main rgister of the 6502. Its content
            is typically used by the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) for the
            first operand and results are deposited in the accumulator
            again. Thus its name, as results accumulate in this register.
