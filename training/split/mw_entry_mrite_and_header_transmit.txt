# byRiclianll - The first M-W (memory-to-disk / write) entry routine labeled MRITE. Initializes the PART pointer (TEMP) with LDA #*00 / STA TEMP, then L00P3 loads TEMP, adds #*20 (increments the PART pointer by $20), stores back to TEMP and branches to DONE if it wraps (BEQ DONE). Prepares channel 15 for output (LDX #*0F; JSR CHKOUT) and transmits the "M-W" command header and parameters by looping L00P4: LDX #*00; L00P4 LDA MW,X; JSR CHROUT; INX; CPX #*06; BNE L00P4 — sending 6 bytes from the MW table.
