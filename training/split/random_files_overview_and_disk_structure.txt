# ********* - Chapter 6.1: Overview of random access files, motivation (direct record access vs sequential scans), basic disk geometry (35 tracks, blocks per track vary by track number), total blocks and DOS commands for direct block access.



6. RANDOM FILES

[ 6.1 Explanation ]

Sequential files are fine when you're just working with a continuous
stream of data, but some jobs require more than that.  For example,
with a large mailing list, you would not want to have to scan through
the entire list to find a person's record.  For this you need some
kind of random access method, some way to get to any record inside a
file without having to read through the entire file first.

There are actually two different types of random access files on the
Commodore disk drive.  The relative files discussed in the next
chapter are more convenient for data handling operations, although the
random files in this chapter have uses of their own, especially when
working with machine language.

Random files on the Commodore disk drive reach the individual 256-byte
blocks of data stored on the disk.  As was mentioned in the first
chapter, there are a total of 683 blocks on the diskette, of which 664
are free on a blank diskette.

The diskette is divided into tracks, which are laid out as concentric
circles on the surface of the diskette.  There are 35 different tracks,
starting with track 1 at the outside of the diskette to track 35 at
the center.  Track 18 is used for the directory, and the DOS fills up
the diskette from the center outward.

Each track is subdivided into blocks.  Because there is more room on
the outer tracks, there are more blocks there.  The outer tracks
contain 21 blocks each, while the inner ones only have 17 blocks each.
The table below shows the number of blocks per track.


       Table 6.1: Track and Block Format
 +--------------+-------------+-------------+
 | TRACK NUMBER | BLOCK RANGE | TOTAL BLOCK |
 +--------------+-------------+-------------+
 |    1 to 17   |   0 to 20   |      21     |
 |   18 to 24   |   0 to 18   |      19     |
 |   25 to 30   |   0 to 17   |      18     |
 |   31 to 35   |   0 to 16   |      17     |
