# Datassette Encoding - Complete byte format and parity: a byte begins with the byte marker (long+medium), followed by 8 bits recorded LSB first, then an odd parity bit (parity = XOR of all 8 data bits XOR 1 yields 1 for odd parity). Each recorded byte takes ~8.96 ms. Compact representation: L/M (marker), S/M bit0, S/M bit1, ..., S/M bit7, M/S parity.

Byte Encoding
-------------

The byte marker indicates the start of a byte. The bits are recorded with the
least significant bit (LSB) first and a parity bit (odd parity) follows.

Odd parity means the total count of "1s" in data bits plus the parity bit
equals an odd number, calculated by XORing a "1" with all eight payload bits.

Each byte takes 8.96 ms to record.
