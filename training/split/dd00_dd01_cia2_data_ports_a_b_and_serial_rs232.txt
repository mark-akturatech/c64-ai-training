# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - CIA #2 Data Ports A and B ($DD00-$DD01): Data port A used for Serial Bus signals (bits 5 & 7 for data out/in, bits 4 & 6 for clock out/in, bit 3 ATN), and bit 2 for RS-232 data output (connected to User Port). RS-232 heavily uses Port B pins (DSR, CTS, DCD, RI, DTR, RTS, SIN). User Port exposes Port B pins and PA2. Serial Bus/RS-232 are slower serial protocols; CIA-2 timers used for RS-232 timing (CIA-1 Timer B used by Serial Bus).

$DD00-$DD01               CIA #2 Data Ports A and B

                          These registers are where the communication with the Serial Bus,
                          RS-232 device, and User Port take place.  The Serial Bus is like the
                          IEEE bus which is used by the PET, in that it allows more than one
                          device to be connected to the port at a time, in a daisychain
                          arrangement.  Since each byte of data is sent one bit at a time,
                          however, the Serial Bus is at least eight times slower than the IEEE.
                          It is presently used to control the 1541 Disk Drive and 1525 printer,
                          and other devices (such as printer interface for Centronics- type
                          parallel printers and stringy floppy wafer tape storage units) can be
                          placed on this bus.

                          Data Port A is used for communication with the Serial Bus.  Bits 5 and
                          7 are used for Serial Bus Data Output and Input, respectively, and
                          Bits 4 and 6 are used for the Serial Bus Clock Pulse Output and Input.
                          Bit 3 of Data Port A is used to send the ATN signal on the Serial Bus.

                          The 64 has built-in software to handle RS-232 communications through a
                          modem or other device plugged in the RS-232/User Port.  The RS-232
                          device uses Bit 2 of Data Port A for data output (it is the only line
                          from Port A that is connected to the RS-232/User Port jack).  It also
                          makes heavy use of Port B, using Bit 7 for the Data Set Ready (DSR)
                          signal, Bit 6 for the Clear to Send (CTS), Bit 4 for the Carrier
                          Detect (DCD), Bit 3 for the Ring Indicator (RI), Bit 2 for Data
                          Terminal Ready (DTR), Bit 1 for Request to Send (RTS), and Bit 0 for
                          data input.  See locations 659-660 ($293-$294) for more details on the
                          RS-232 device.

                          All of the data lines which the RS-232 device uses are also available
                          to the user as part of the User Port.  All of the Port B data lines,
                          and Bit 2 of Port A, are brought out to the User Port connector on the
                          back of the 64.  These data bits are utilized in the normal way:  The
                          port connections are made to TTL-level input or output devices, and
                          the direction of data is determined by the Data Direction Registers.

                          In addition, the User Port has pins connected to the two CIA Serial
                          Ports (whose eight-bit shift registers are well-suited for
                          serial-to-parallel and parallel-to-serial conversion),and the two CNT
                          lines which aid in the operation of the Serial Ports.  The CNT lines
                          can also be used in conjunction with the CIA Timers, and allow them to
                          be used as frequency counters, event counters, interval timers, etc.
                          The advanced features of the CIA chip make almost any type of
                          interfacing application possible, and in the near future we will
                          probably see many interesting applications for the User Port on the
                          64.  A pin description of the User Port connector is provided below:
