# The MOS 6567/6569 video controller (VIC-II) and its application in the Commodore 64 - ECM=1, BMM=1, MCM=0 invalid bitmap mode 1: displays black screen but internal graphics can be scanned with sprite collision trick. Structure resembles standard bitmap but g-address bits 9 and 10 are forced to zero due to ECM, causing repeated sections in displayed bitmap (graphics repeated four times). g-data ends up black.

3.7.3.7. Invalid bitmap mode 1 (ECM/BMM/MCM=1/1/0)
--------------------------------------------------

This mode also only displays a black screen, but the pixels can also be
read out with the sprite collision trick.

The structure of the graphics is basically as in standard bitmap mode, but
the bits 9 and 10 of the g-addresses are always zero due to the set ECM bit
and so the graphics is - roughly said - made up of four "sections" that are
each repeated four times.
