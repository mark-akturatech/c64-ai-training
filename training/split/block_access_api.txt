# Commodore IEC Serial Bus Protocol Reference - pagetable.com - Block access API: 256-byte logical blocks identified by track/sector. '#' channel syntax allocates a buffer for direct block access. Commands include U1 (UA) read block, U2 (UB) write block, B-A allocate block in BAM, B-F free block in BAM. Example sequence to read track 18 sector 0 into a buffer via channel 2.

Block Access API:
  The block system uses 256-byte logical blocks identified by track/sector.
  The "#" channel syntax allocates a buffer for direct block access.

  Commands:
    U1 (UA)  - Read a block into buffer
    U2 (UB)  - Write a block from buffer
    B-A      - Allocate a block in the BAM (Block Availability Map)
    B-F      - Free a block in the BAM

  Example: Reading track 18, sector 0 via channel 2:
    OPEN 2,8,2,"#"       ; Allocate buffer on channel 2
    PRINT#15,"U1:2,0,18,0" ; Read track 18, sector 0 into buffer
    ; ... read data from channel 2 ...
    CLOSE 2
