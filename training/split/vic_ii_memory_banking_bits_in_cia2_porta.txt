# ********* - Explains that Bits 0-1 of CIA #2 Port A select the 16K VIC-II video memory bank (00=bank3 $C000-$FFFF, 01=bank2 $8000-$BFFF, 10=bank1 $4000-$7FFF, 11=bank0 $0000-$3FFF). Describes default power-on bank (bottom 16K) and why you might change banks. Overview of what each 16K block contains and issues when VIC-II sees ROMs under certain banks (character generator ROM mapping), and notes the technique to change banks from BASIC.

Bits 0 and 1 of CIA #2 Port A have an extremely important function.
As mentioned in the section on the VIC-II chip (53248, $D000), the
video chip can address only 16K of memory at a time, and all graphics
data must be stored in that 16K block in order to be displayed.
Within this area, sprite graphics data may be placed in any of 256
groups of 64 bytes each.  Character data can be stored in any of eight
2K blocks.  Text screen memory may be in any of 16 1K areas, and
bitmap screen memory may be in either of two 8K sections.

When you turn the power on, the VIC-II uses the bottom 16K of memory
for graphics.  Unfortunately, this block of memory is also used
extensively for other important purposes.  Though some means of
eliminating these conflicts are discussed above, in many situations
you will want to change from the default 16K bank at the low end of
memory.

Bits 0 and 1 select the current 16K bank for video memory from the
four possible choices using the following bit patterns:

00 (bit value of 0) Bank 3 (49152-65535, $C000-$FFFF)
01 (bit value of 1) Bank 2 (32768-49151, $8000-$BFFF)
10 (bit value of 2) Bank 1 (16384-32767, $4000-$7FFF)
11 (bit value of 3) Bank 0 (0-16383, $0-$3FFF)

The technique for making this change from BASIC is discussed below.
But before we go ahead and start changing banks, let's briefly review
the contents of these areas, and the considerations for using them for
graphics.

Block 0.  This is normally used for system variables and BASIC program
text.  Locations 1024-2047 ($400-$7FF) are reserved for the default
position of screen memory.

There is an addition limitation on memory usage of this block, as the
VIC-II sees the character generator ROM at 4096-8191 ($1000-$1FFF),
making this portion of memory unavailable for other graphics data.
Generally, there is little free space here for graphics display data.
Locations 679-767 ($2A7- $2FF) are unused, and could hold one sprite
shape (number 11) or data for 11 characters.  The area from 820-1023
($334-$3FF), which includes the cassette I/O buffer, is available for
graphics memory, and is large enough to hold three sprite shapes
(numbers 13, 14, and 15), or data for 25 characters (numbers 103-127).
But getting enough memory for bitmap graphics requires that you either
