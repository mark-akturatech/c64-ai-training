# C64 PAL/NTSC Raster Timing Reference - Definition of 'raster time' (duration to render one byte / 8 pixels) and basic frame calculations: PAL example (63 cycles x 312 lines = 19,656 cycles ~50.12 Hz) and NTSC example (65 cycles x 263 lines = 17,095 cycles ~59.83 Hz). Explains that each raster line includes visible pixels plus horizontal blanking and that total raster lines include vertical blanking.

SECTION 3: RASTER TIME BASICS
=============================================================================

"Raster time" is the duration it takes the VIC-II to render one byte of graphic
data (8 pixels) onto the screen. It is measured in raster lines or CPU cycles.

One complete screen frame consists of:
  - PAL:  63 cycles x 312 lines = 19,656 cycles per frame (~50.12 Hz)
  - NTSC: 65 cycles x 263 lines = 17,095 cycles per frame (~59.83 Hz)

Each raster line includes visible pixels plus horizontal blanking (borders
and retrace). Similarly, the total raster lines include visible lines plus
vertical blanking.
