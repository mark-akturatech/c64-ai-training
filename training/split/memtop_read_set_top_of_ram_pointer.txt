Read/Set Top of RAM Pointer

This is a documented Kernal routine, which can be entered through the
jump table at location 65433 ($FF99).

It can be used to either read or set the top of RAM pointer.  If
called with the Carry flag set, the address in the pointer will be
loaded into the .X and .Y registers.  If called with the Carry flag
cleared, the pointer will be changed to the address found in the .X
and .Y registers.
