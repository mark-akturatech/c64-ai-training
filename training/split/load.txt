# Commodore 64 KERNAL Functions Reference - LOAD ($FFD5). Loads or verifies a file (requires SETLFS/SETNAM). Input: A = operation (0 = load, 1-255 = verify); X/Y = load address if secondary address = 0. Output: Carry flag (0 = success, 1 = error); A = error code if Carry=1; X/Y = last byte address if Carry=0. Uses A, X, Y registers. Real address: $F49E.
