# MACHINE - Options for placing ML programs: cassette buffer for short tests (190 bytes); move down TOM to install permanent ML near top-of-memory (requires pointer changes); place ML after end-of-BASIC and move SOV upward so variables don't overwrite ML—each method's tradeoffs and persistence discussed.



Where to Put Your ML Program
----------------------------

First, you may put your program in the cassette buffer.  Providing you are
not performing input/output activity, your program will be safe.  Your space
here is limited to 190 characters or so.


                 SOB        SOV   SOA   EOA   BOS   TOM
                  |          |     |     |     |     |
  -+========+----+----------+-----+-----+-- --+-----+--
   |C.B.====|    | BASIC... | VAR | ARR | ... | STR |
  -+========+----+----------+-----+-----+-- --+-----+--

Second, move down the top-of-memory pointer and place the program in the
space that has been freed.  Your space here is unlimited.  Programs placed
here will take up permanent residence until the power is turned off.  Many
monitors, such as Supermon, live here.
