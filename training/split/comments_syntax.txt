# Kick Assembler - Section 3.10: Supported comment styles — line comments with // and block comments /* ... */; example placements of comments and note that traditional 65xx semicolon comments (;) are not supported because ';' is used in .for loops.

3.10. Comments
Comments are pieces of the program that are ignored by the assembler. Kick Assembler supports line and block
comments known from languages such as C++ and Java. When the assembler sees ‘//’ it ignores the rest of that
line. C block comments ignores everything between /* and */.

rts

Traditional 65xx assembler line comments (;) are not supported since the semicolon is used in for-loops in the
script language.
