# Contents - Explains enabling and disabling sprites using SPREN ($D015): each bit in SPREN corresponds to a sprite; set the bit to enable that sprite (visible only if X/Y are on-screen), clear the bit to disable it.

Enabling a sprite. Before a sprite can be 
seen, it must be enabled. The register SPREN 
($D015), has an enable bit for each sprite. If the bit 
is set, the sprite will be enabled. The sprite will only 
be seen if the X and Y positions are set to the visi- 
ble portion of the screen. A sprite can be disabled 
by clearing the appropriate bit.
