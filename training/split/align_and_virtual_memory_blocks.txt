# Kick Assembler - Shows using 'align' parameter with startAfter to align default memory block, and 'virtual' flag to make memory blocks virtual (thrown away). Example: .segmentdef Virtual100 [startAfter="Code", align=$100, virtual] and usage with .segment Virtual100 "Table" table: .fill $100,0. Memory map shows Virtual100 start aligned to $100 boundary.

A segment can be included in multiple other segment as seen by the 'Code' and 'Data' segment in the above
example.
This can be combined freely with adding code from other sources or directly using commands (lda, sta) inside
the segment.

10.9. Including .prg files
A prg-file contains a start address (the two first bytes) and some data. Prg files can be imported as memory
blocks using the prgFiles parameter when defining the segment:
// Importing prg files when defining segment
.segmentdef Misc1 [prgFiles="data/Music.prg, data/Charset2x2.prg"]

// Another way of producing the same result
.segment Misc2 []
*=$1000 // Here we have to place the block manually
.import c64 "data/Music.prg"
*=$2000 // Here we have to place the block manually
.import c64 "data/Charset2x2.prg"

Again, this can freely be combined with other ways of adding blocks to the segment.

10.10. Including sid files
Sid music files are imported as memory blocks using the 'sidFiles' parameter. Here is an example that plays
a sid tune:
