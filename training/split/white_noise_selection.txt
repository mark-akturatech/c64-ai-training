# COMMODORE 64 - Describes the white noise waveform (ASCII illustration) as useful for sound effects and gives the BASIC change to hear it by setting the program's start number in line 70 to 129 and the stop number in line 90 to 128.

    The last waveform available to you is white noise (shown here).

  changing the start number in line 70 to 129 and the stop number in line
  90 to 128.
