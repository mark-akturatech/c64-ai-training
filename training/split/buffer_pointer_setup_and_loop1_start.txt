# byRiclianll - Continuation of the MRITE/send-to-disk sequence showing setup of buffer pointers and indices and the start of the data processing loop. Contains labels and instructions that store and load buffer-related locations (e.g., STA 1, LDY 1) and the declaration of LOOP1 (incomplete in this excerpt). This chunk covers the transition from header transmit to buffer initialization and the top of the per-buffer loop.
