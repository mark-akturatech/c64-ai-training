# 6502 Addressing Modes - Immediate, Absolute, Zero Page, Implied, Accumulator

  ADDRESSING MODES

   Instructions need operands to work on. There are various ways of
  indicating where the processor is to get these operands. The different
  methods used to do this are called addressing modes. The 6502 offers 11
  modes, as described below.

  1) Immediate
  In this mode the operand's value is given in the instruction itself. In
  assembly language this is indicated by "#" before the operand.
  eg.  LDA #$0A - means "load the accumulator with the hex value 0A"
  In machine code different modes are indicated by different codes. So LDA
  would be translated into different codes depending on the addressing mode.
  In this mode, it is: $A9 $0A

  2 & 3) Absolute and Zero-page Absolute
  In these modes the operands address is given.
  eg.  LDA $31F6 - (assembler)
       $AD $31F6 - (machine code)
  If the address is on zero page - i.e. any address where the high byte is
  00 - only 1 byte is needed for the address. The processor automatically
  fills the 00 high byte.
  eg.  LDA $F4
       $A5 $F4
  Note the different instruction codes for the different modes.
  Note also that for 2 byte addresses, the low byte is store first, eg.
  LDA $31F6 is stored as three bytes in memory, $AD $F6 $31.
  Zero-page absolute is usually just called zero-page.

  4) Implied
  No operand addresses are required for this mode. They are implied by the
  instruction.
  eg.  TAX - (transfer accumulator contents to X-register)
       $AA

  5) Accumulator
  In this mode the instruction operates on data in the accumulator, so no
  operands are needed.
  eg.  LSR - logical bit shift right
       $4A

  6 & 7) Indexed and Zero-page Indexed
  In these modes the address given is added to the value in either the X or
  Y index register to give the actual address of the operand.
  eg.  LDA $31F6, Y
       $D9 $31F6
       LDA $31F6, X
       $DD $31F6
  Note that the different operation codes determine the index register used.
  In the zero-page version, you should note that the X and Y registers are
  not interchangeable. Most instructions which can be used with zero-page
  indexing do so with X only.
  eg.  LDA $20, X
       $B5 $20
