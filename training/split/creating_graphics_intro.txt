Chapter 9 
Creating Graphics 



Up until now, this book has been primarily con- 
cerned with background information necessary for 
creating the program that will ultimately become 
a game. This is certainly an important part of learn- 
ing to program a game, but by no means all of it. 
Because a video game is an audio-visual experience, 
it will be necessary to create the graphics data that 
will be operated on by the program. 

There are a number of methods that can be 
used to create and enter graphics information into 
the computer. The method that you choose is pure- 
ly a matter of personal preference. This chapter will 
discuss a few of the options available to you when 
it is time to create graphics data. Also, instructions 
for using the graphics utility programs in Appen- 
dix C are given in this chapter.
