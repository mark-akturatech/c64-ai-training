# Contents - Warns to avoid assemblers that do not print absolute addresses for instructions, data statements, and used hardware/RAM registers; emphasizes that absolute address information is essential for effective debugging.

Beware of an assembler that won't tell you 
where it has put your code or data. Your assembler 
should have in its printout absolute addresses for 
every instruction, data statement, and hardware or 
RAM register that has been used. If your assembler 
does not provide this information, you will find your 
program extremely difficult to debug.
