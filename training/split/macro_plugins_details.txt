# Kick Assembler - Macro plugin details: IMacro interface and MacroDefinition class structure reiterated: IMacro has getDefinition() and execute(IValue[] parameters, IEngine engine). MacroDefinition contains name property. Refer to Quick Example for full implementation.

[..FILE2 PARAMETERS..],
[..FILE3 PARAMETERS..],
....
}

When WRITERNAME matches the name given in the definition the writer is called. Then we have two kinds of
parameters: disk and file parameters. For each of these is a set of all possible parameters and a set of non-optional
parameters. If a parameter is give that is not included in the allParameters set Kick Assembler will generate an
error. The same will happen if a non optional parameter is missing.
The execute method has parameters of two new interfaces:
public interface IDiskData {
IParameterMap getParameters();
List<IDiskFileData> getFiles();
}
public interface IDiskFileData {
