# COMMODORE 64 - SAVE ["file-name"][,device][,address]: stores current program in memory to tape or disk (file type 'prg'). Defaults: cassette device 1 if omitted. SAVEs to tape are stored twice for error checking; optional secondary address controls loading behavior and end-of-tape markers: address 1 causes KERNAL to LOAD tape at original address later; 2 writes end-of-tape marker; 3 combines both. Disk saves require filename. Examples of various SAVE forms.

  SAVE

  TYPE: Command
  FORMAT: SAVE ["<file-name>"][,<device-number>][,<address>]

    Action: The SAVE command is used to store the program that is cur-
  rently in memory onto a tape or diskette file. The program being SAVED
  is only affected by the command while the SAVE is happening. The program
  remains in the current computer memory even after the SAVE operation is
  completed until you put something else there by using another command.
  The file type will be "prg" (program). If the <device-number> is left
  out, then the C64 will automatically assume that you want the program
  saved on cassette, device number 1. If the <device-number> is an <8>,
  then the program is written onto disk. The SAVE statement can be used

  be used in your programs and execution will continue with the next
  statement after the SAVE is completed.
    Programs on tape are automatically stored twice, so that your Com-
  modore 64 can check for errors when LOADing the program back in. When
  saving programs to tape, the <file-name> and secondary <address> are
  optional. But following a SAVE with a program name in quotes ("") or
  by a string variable (---$) helps your Commodore 64 find each program
  more easily. If the file-name is left out it can NOT be LOADed by name
  later on.
    A secondary address of I will tell the KERNAL to LOAD the tape at a
  later time, with the program currently in memory instead of the normal
  2048 location. A secondary address of 2 will cause an end-of-tape marker
  to follow the program. A secondary address of 3 combines both functions.
    When saving programs onto a disk, the <file-name> must be present.


  EXAMPLES of SAVE Command.

    SAVE               (Write to tape without a name)

    SAVE"ALPHA",1      (Store on tape as file-name "alpha")

    SAVE"ALPHA",1,2    (Store "alpha" with end-of-tape marker)

    SAVE"FUN.DISK",8   (SAVES on disk (device 8 is the disk))

    SAVE A$            (Store on tape with the name A$)

    10 SAVE"HI"        (SAVEs program and then move to next program line)

    SAVE"ME",1,3       (Stores at same memory location and puts an
                        end-of-tope marker on)
