# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - POWER RESET ENTRY POINT: Cold start vector ($FFFC) entry. Initializes stack pointer (TXS to #$FF), disables interrupts (SEI), clears decimal mode (CLD), checks for autostart cartridge at $8000 by calling $FD02, performs autostart indirect jump if present, otherwise initializes I/O ($FDA3), system constants ($FD50), KERNAL reset ($FD15) and PAL/NTSC setup ($FF5B). Ends by re-enabling interrupts (CLI) and jumping indirectly to BASIC coldstart ($A000).

                                *** POWER RESET ENTRY POINT
                                The system hardware reset vector ($FFFC) points here. This
                                is the first routine executed when the computer is
                                switched on. The routine firstly sets the stackpointer to
                                #ff, disables interrupts and clears the decimal flag. It
                                jumps to a routine at $fd02 which checks for autostart
                                cartridges. If so, an indirect jump is performed to the
                                cartridge coldstart vector at $8000. I/O chips are
                                initiated, and system constants are set up. Finally the IRQ
                                is enabled, and an indirect jump is performed to $a000,
                                the basic cold start vector.
