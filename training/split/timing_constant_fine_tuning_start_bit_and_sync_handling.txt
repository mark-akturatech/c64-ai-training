# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Fine-tune tape timing constants: load or clear timing-adjust flag ($92), increment/decrement the min timing byte ($B0) based on measured values, handle an embedded .BYTE patch entry, clear the timing-adjust flag, compare saved X ($D7) and branch accordingly, check start-bit detection counters ($A9) and save block synchronization number ($96). Finalize by toggling $9B with EOR and prepare to exit.
