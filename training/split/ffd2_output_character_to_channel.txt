# C64 KERNAL API (Lee Davison) - $FFD2 — Output character to channel. Sends A as a character to the currently opened output channel (set by CHKOUT $FFC9). If omitted, output goes to default device 3 (screen). Channel remains open after call. Warning: data is sent to all open output channels on the serial bus; close other channels first if not desired.

$FFD2          output character to channel
               
               This routine will output a character to an already opened channel. Use the OPEN
               routine, $FFC0, and the CHKOUT routine, $FFC9, to set up the output channel
               before calling this routine. If these calls are omitted, data will be sent to the
               default output device, device 3, the screen. The data byte to be output is loaded
               into the accumulator, and this routine is called. The data is then sent to the
               specified output device. The channel is left open after the call.
               
               NOTE: Care must be taken when using routine to send data to a serial device since
               data will be sent to all open output channels on the bus. Unless this is desired,
               all open output channels on the serial bus other than the actually intended
               destination channel must be closed by a call to the KERNAL close channel routine.
