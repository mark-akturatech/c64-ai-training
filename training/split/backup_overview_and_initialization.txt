# byRiclianll - Title, limitations and parameters for backing up a DOS‑protected diskette, plus the start of the 1541 BACKUP BASIC listing (lines 100–320). Includes the REM header, initial POKE/CLR setup, FOR loops that dimension and initialize the T() table, a READ of SRW/ERW values, program banner/insert‑master prompt, GOSUB to the user‑prompt routine, OPEN15,8,15 to talk to the 1541, initialization of RW and RAM pointers, a short POKE to set up the buffer (POKE 252,34) and initial C=0 flag. (This chunk prepares the program and user for reading the master disk.)

7.17  How  to  Backup  a  DOS  Protected  Diskette 

Limitations:  Does  not  recreate  any  bad  sectors.  Requires  six  passes  to  backup  a  diskette 
(see  the  annotation  below). 

Parameters:  A  formatted  diskette.
