# Contents - Describes the monitor as the final piece of the development system: a program to examine/modify memory, load/save memory areas to disk, and provide a small disassembler to view memory as assembly language. Warns against monitors fixed in a single memory location (such as cartridge monitors) because they can conflict with programs; recommends relocatable monitors or providing multiple monitor versions (high-RAM and low-RAM) so one can be used without preventing program use of memory.

The last piece of an assembly language develop- 
ment system is a monitor. This is a program that 
allows you to examine the computer's memory and 
change or move the contents. It also must allow you 
to load and save areas of memory from the disk
