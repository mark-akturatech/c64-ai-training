# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Demo components: graphics, sound, and code. Focus on graphics effects, music playback is usually simple via standard players; loaders needed for multi-part demos may be used (IRQ loaders).

Demo Programming
Finally, we get to the interesting stuff, ie. demo programming. Now, there are a lot of things you need to know about if you're going to write a demo, so we'll have to decide where to start. A demo consists of graphics, sound and code. Of course, in this document we'll concentrate on producing the code, but you'll still need to know how to display graphics and play sounds.

The sound in most demos is music, and playing music produced with some music editor, like DMC or JCH's editor, is very easy. You don't really need to make the music yourself either, you can always use someone else's music, as long as you give credit to the person who did the music. I'll show you what to do to play a tune in an example below, but first there are some basic concepts we need to cover, like synchronizing things with the screen refresh.

As playing music is so easy (unless you're going to do something really fancy), we'll concentrate on coding graphics effects, because that's really everything you need in a demo.

Of course, if you make a multi-part demo that can't be squeezed into memory, you'll need to load parts from disk. You don't have to write a loader yourself, though, as there are some very good loaders around already.

- "graphics_intro" which expands on graphics primitives (sprites, chars, bitmap)
