# byRiclianll - Step-by-step conversion of a single byte ($12) into GCR: hexadecimal to binary, high-nybble and low-nybble lookup to 5-bit GCR codes, and concatenation into a 10-bit GCR sequence.

Using  the  binary  to  GCR  lookup  table  above,  let's  walk  through  the  necessary  steps 
to  convert  a  $12  (18)  to  GCR  form.

STEP  1.  Hexadecimal  to  Binary  Conversion 

$12  (18)  =  00010010 
STEP  2.  High  Nybble  to  GCR  Conversion 

OOOlxxxx  =  $1  (1)  =  01011 
STEP  3.  Low  Nybble  to  GCR  Conversion 

xxxxOOlO  =  $2  (2)  =  10010 
STEP  4.  GCR  Concatenation 

01011  +  10010  =  0101110010
