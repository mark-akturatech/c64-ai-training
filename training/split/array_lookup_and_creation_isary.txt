45521         $B1D1          ISARY
Find Array Element or Create New Array in RAM

This routine searches for an array.  If it is found, the subscript
value is checked to see if it is valid, and pointers to the array and
element of the array are set.  If it is not found, the array is
created, and the pointers set.
