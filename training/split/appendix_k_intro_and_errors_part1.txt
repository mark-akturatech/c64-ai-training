  APPENDIX K


  ERROR MESSAGES


    This appendix contains a complete list of the error messages generated
  by the Commodore-64, with a description of causes.


  BAD DATA            String data was received from an open file, but the
                      program was expecting numeric data.
  BAD SUBSCRIPT       The program was trying to reference an element of an
                      array whose number is outside of the range specified
                      in the DIM statement.
  BREAK               Program execution was stopped because you hit the
                      <STOP> key.
  CAN'T CONTINUE      The CONT command will not work, either because the
                      program was never RUN, there has been an error, or
                      a line has been edited.
  DEVICE NOT PRESENT  The required I/O device was not available for an
                      OPEN, CLOSE, CMD, PRINT#, INPUT#, or GET#.
  DIVISION BY ZERO    Division by zero is a mathematical oddity and not
                      allowed.
  EXTRA IGNORED       Too many items of data were typed in response to an
                      INPUT statement. Only the first few items were
                      accepted.
  FILE NOT FOUND      If you were looking for a file on tape, and END-OF-
                      TAPE marker was found. If you were looking on disk,
                      no file with that name exists.
  FILE NOT OPEN       The file specified in a CLOSE, CMD, PRINT#, INPUT#,
                      or GET#, must first be OPENed.
  FILE OPEN           An attempt was made to open a file using the number
                      of an already open file.
  FORMULA TOO COMPLEX The string expression being evaluated should be split
                      into at least two parts for the system to work with,
                      or a formula has too many parentheses.
  ILLEGAL DIRECT      The INPUT statement can only be used within a pro-
                      gram, and not in direct mode.
  ILLEGAL QUANTITY    A number used as the argument of a function or
                      statement is out of the allowable range.
