# byRiclianll - Directory entry example for the file 'DIR' on 1541TEST/DEMO (track 18 sector 04): shows entry bytes indicating 'DIR' starts at track 16 ($10) sector 01 and is 4 blocks long. Provides the directory entry hex bytes.

Let's  examine  the  program  file  "DIR"  on  your  1541TEST/DEMO  disk.  DIR  appears 
in  the  directory  on  track  18,  sector  04.  The  directory  entry  looks  like  this: 


49 


TRACK   18  -  SECTOR  04 

.    00:    00  FF  82   10  01   44  49  52   DIR 

.    08:    AO  AO  AO  AO  AO  AO  AO  AO   

.    10:    AO  AO  AO  AO  AO  00  OO  00   

.    18:    00  00  00  00  00  00  04  OO   


From  the  entry  we  see  that  "DIR"  starts  at  track  16  ($10),  sector  01  ($01)  and  that 
the  file  is  four  blocks  long  (4  +  0  *  256). 


.  00:  00  FF  82   lO  01  44  49  52   DIR 

.  08:  AO  AO  AO  AO  AO  AO  AO  AO   

.  10:  AO  AO  AO  AO  AO  00  00  00   

.  18:  00  OO  00  00  00  OO  04  00
