# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $D02F-$D03F — Not connected VIC-II addresses: these 17 addresses don't access memory; they read as $FF and ignore writes.

$D02F-$D03F               Not Connected

                          The VIC-II chip has only 47 registers for 64 bytes of possible address
                          space.  Therefore, the remaining 17 addresses do not access any
                          memory.  When read, they will always give a value of 255 ($FF).  This
                          value will not change after writing to them.
