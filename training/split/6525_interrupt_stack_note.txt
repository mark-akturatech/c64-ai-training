# MACHINE - Important note about the 6525's Interrupt Stack used to maintain priority interrupt information. Explains that a read of AIR pushes the interrupt stack and a write to AIR pops it; warns against extraneous reads/writes to AIR (should only read AIR to respond to an interrupt and write AIR to signal service completion).

  *------------------------------------------------------------------------*
  | NOTE:  It was indicated that the 6525 will maintain Priority Interrupt |
  | information from previously serviced interrupts.                       |
  |                                                                        |
  | This is achieved by the use of an Interrupt Stack.  This stack is      |
  | pushed whenever a read of AIR occurs and is pulled whenever a write to |
  | AIR occurs.  It is therefore important not to perform any extraneous   |
  | reads or writes to AIR since this will cause extra and unwanted stack  |
  | operations to occur.                                                   |
  |                                                                        |
  | The only time a read of AIR should occur is to respond to an interrupt |
  | request.                                                               |
  |                                                                        |
  | The only time a write of AIR should occur is to signal the 6525 that   |
  | the interrupt service is complete.                                     |
