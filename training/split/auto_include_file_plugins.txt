# Kick Assembler - AutoIncludeFile plugins: include source files (e.g. macros) bundled inside an archive. Typical usage places a source file in the jar (e.g. '/include/MyAutoInclude.asm') and adds an AutoIncludeFile entry to the archive specifying jar-name, a class reference used to open the resource, and the resource path. Example provided: .macro SetColor(color) { ... } and AutoIncludeFile("MyArchive.jar", getClass(), "/include/MyAutoInclude.asm"). IAutoIncludeFile interface: AutoIncludeFileDefinition getDefinition(); InputStream openStream(); AutoIncludeFileDefinition contains filePath and jarName.


-binfile

Sets the output to be a bin file instead
of a prg file. The difference between
a bin and a prg file is that the bin file
doesn’t contain the two start address
bytes.

-bytedump

-bytebump

Dumps the assembled bytes in the
file ByteDump.txt together with the
code that generated them.

-bytedumpfile

-bytebumpfile myfile.txt

Same as -bytedump but with an argument specifying the name of the file

-cfgfile

-cfgfile "../../MyConfig.Cfg"

Use additional configuration file
(like KickAss.cfg). Supply the file as
an absolute path, or a path relative
to the source file. You can have as
many additional config files as you
want.

-debug

-debug

For development use. Adds additional debug info, like stacktraces, to the
output.

-debugdump
