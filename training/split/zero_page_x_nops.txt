# NMOS 6510 - Undocumented zero-page,X NOPs (DOP, SKB, IGN): opcodes $14, $34, $54, $74, $D4, $F4. Each listed as 'NOP zp, x' with 'Fetch {addr}', size = 2 bytes, cycles = 4. Operation note: NOP zp and NOP zp,x perform a memory read (the fetched value is discarded), i.e., they have the timing/read behavior of the addressing mode but no effect on registers or flags.

Operation: NOP zp and NOP zp,x actually perform a read operation. It's just that the value read
is not stored in any register.
