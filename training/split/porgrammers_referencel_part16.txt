  OR

  TYPE: Logical Operator
  FORMAT: <operand> OR <operand>


  Action: Just as the relational operators can be used to make decisions
  regarding program flow, logical operators can connect two or more re-
  lations and return a true or false value which can then be used in a
  decision. When used in calculations, the logical OR gives you a bit
  result of I if the corresponding bit of either or both operands is 1.
  This will produce an integer as a result depending on the values of the
  operands. When used in comparisons the logical OR operator is also used
  to link two expressions into a single compound expression. If either of
  the expressions are true, the combined expression value is true (-1). In
  the first example below if AA is equal to BB OR if XX is 20, the
  expression is true.
    Logical operators work by converting their operands to 16-bit, signed,
  two's complement integers in the range of -32768 to +32767. If the
  operands are not in the range an error message results. Each bit of the
  result is determined by the corresponding bits in the two operands.



  EXAMPLES of OR Operator:


    100 IF (AA=BB) OR (XX=20) THEN...

    230 KK%=64 OR 32: PRINT KK%         (You typed this with a bit
                                         value of 1000000 for 64
                                         and 100000 for 32)

    96                                  (The computer responded with
                                         bit value 1100000.
                                         1100000=96.)

  PEEK

  TYPE: Integer Function
  FORMAT: PEEK(<numeric>)

    Action: Returns an integer in the range of 0 to 255, which is read
  from a memory location. The <numeric> expression is a memory location
  which must be in the range of 0 to 65535. If it isn't then the BASIC
  error message ?ILLEGAL QUANTITY occurs.

  EXAMPLES of PEEK Function:

    10 PRINT PEEK(53280) AND 15   (Returns value of screen border color)

    5 A%=PEEK(45)+PEEK(46)*256    (Returns address of BASIC variable table)


  POKE

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: POKE <location>,<value>

  Action: The POKE statement is used to write a one-byte (8-bits) binary
  value into a given memory location or input/output register. The
  <location> is an arithmetic expression which must equal a value in the
  range of 0 to 65535. The <value> is an expression which can be reduced to
  an integer value of 0 to 255. If either value is out of its respective
  range, the BASIC error message ?ILLEGAL QUANTITY occurs.
    The POKE statement and PEEK statement (which is a built-in function
  that looks at a memory location) are useful for data storage, controlling
  graphics displays or sound generation, loading assembly language sub-
  routines, and passing arguments and results to and from assembly language
  subroutines. In addition, Operating System parameters can be examined
  using PEEK statements or changed and manipulated using POKE statements.
  A complete memory map of useful locations is given in Appendix G.

  EXAMPLES of POKE Statement:

    POKE 1024, 1         (Puts an "A" at position 1 on the screen)
    POKE 2040, PTR       (Updates Sprite #0 data pointer)
    10 POKE RED,32
    20 POKE 36879,8
    2050 POKE A,B


  POS

  TYPE: Integer Function
  FORMAT: POS (<dummy>)

    Action: Tells you the current cursor position which, of course, is in
  the range of 0 (leftmost character) though position 79 on an 80-character
  logical screen line. Since the Commodore 64 has a 40-column screen, any
  position from 40 through 79 will refer to the second screen line. The
  dummy argument is ignored.

  EXAMPLE of POS Function:

    1000 IF POS(0)>38 THEN PRINT CHR$(13)


  PRINT

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: PRINT [<variable>][<,/;><variable>]...

    Action: The PRINT statement is normally used to write data items to
  the screen. However, the CMD statement may be used to re-direct that
  output to any other device in the system. The <variable(s)> in the
  output-list are expressions of any type. If no output-list is present, a
  blank line is printed. The position of each printed item is determined by
  the punctuation used to separate items in the output-list.
    The punctuation characters that you can use are blanks, commas, or
  semicolons. The 80-character logical screen line is divided into 8 print
  zones of 10 spaces each. In the list of expressions, a comma causes the
  next value to be printed at the beginning of the next zone. A semicolon
  causes the next value to be printed immediately following the previous
  value. However, there are two exceptions to this rule:

  70   BASIC LANGUAGE VOCABULARY
~


    1) Numeric items are followed by an added space.
    2) Positive numbers have a space preceding them.

    When you use blanks or no punctuation between string constants or
  variable names it has the same effect as a semicolon. However, blanks
  between a string and a numeric item or between two numeric items will
  stop output without printing the second item.
    If a comma or a semicolon is at the end of the output-list, the next
  PRINT statement begins printing on the same line, and spaced accord-
  ingly. If no punctuation finishes the list, a carriage-return and a line-
  feed are printed at the end of the data. The next PRINT statement will
  begin on the next line. If your output is directed to the screen and the
  data printed is longer than 40 columns, the output is continued on the
  next screen line.
    There is no statement in BASIC with more variety than the PRINT
  statement. There are so many symbols, functions, and parameters
  associated with this statement that it might almost be considered as a
  language of its own within BASIC; a language specially designed for
  writing on the screen.

  EXAMPLES of PRINT Statement:

  1)
     5 X = 5
    10 PRINT -5*X,X-5,X+5,X^5

    -25     0     10     3125


  2)
     5 X=9
    10 PRINT X;"SQUARED IS";X*X;"AND";
    20 PRINT X "CUBED IS" X^3

    9 SQUARED IS 81 AND 9 CUBED IS 729


  3)
     90 AA$="ALPHA":BB$="BAKER":CC$="CHARLIE":DD$="DOG":EE$="ECHO"
    100 PRINT AA$BB$;CC$ DD$,EE$

    ALPHABAKERCHARLIEDOG     ECHO

  Quote Mode

    Once the quote mark <SHIFT+2> is typed, the cursor controls stop
  operating and start displaying reversed characters which actually stand
  for the cursor control you are hitting. This allows you to program these
  cursor controls, because once the text inside the quotes is PRINTed they
  perform their functions. The <INST/DEL> key is the only cursor control
  not affected by "quote mode."

  1. Cursor Movement

    The cursor controls which can be "programmed" in quote mode are:

          KEY                             APPEARS AS

        <CLR/HOME>
        <SHIFT+CLR/HOME>
        <CRSR UP/DOWN>
        <SHIFT+CRSR UP/DOWN>
        <CRSR LEFT/RIGHT>
        <SHIFT+CRSR LEFT/RIGHT>


    If you wanted the word HELLO to PRINT diagonally from the upper left
  corner of the screen, you would type:

  PRINT"<HOME>H<DOWN>E<DOWN>L<DOWN>L<DOWN>O"

  2. Reverse Characters

    Holding down the <CTRL> key and hitting <9> will cause <R> to appear
  inside the quotes. This will make all characters start printing in
  reverse video (like a negative of a picture). To end the reverse printing
  hit <CTRL+0>, or else PRINT a <RETURN> (CHR$(13)). (Just ending the PRINT
  statement without a semicolon or comma will take care of this.)

  3.Color Controls

    Holding down the <CTRL> key or <C=> key with any of the 8 color keys
  will make a special reversed character appear in the quotes. When the
  character is PRINTed, then the color change will occur.
