# Contents - Immediate addressing: operand prefixed by '#' supplies the literal value to load into the accumulator (e.g., LDA #$00 or LDA #BLACK if BLACK equated to $00). Immediate mode does not access memory locations.

Immediate Mode Addressing 

In the immediate mode, the data that follows 
the # character will be loaded into the accumulator. 
Instead of entering data to be loaded, you could 
enter a label that has previously been equated to 
a value. For example, if you had defined the label 
BLACK to equal O, the following statements would 
be identical: 

LDA #$00 
LDA #BLACK 

In either case, a is loaded into the accumulator. 
In all of the other modes, data is loaded from a 
memory location as indicated by the operand.
