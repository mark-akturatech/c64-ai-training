# Analyzing C64 tape loaders - The Read Byte subroutine used throughout the loader to gather bits/bytes from tape. Covers: comment header; LDA #$07 and STA $F8 to set bit counter; JSR $02D4 to align/read bits; ROL $F7 to collect bits into the MSb-first buffer (carry retrieved from the bit-read handler at $02E1); border flashing via INC $D020; loop decrement of $F8 and BPL back to JSR $02D4 until 8 bits read; final LDA $F7 and RTS; trailing separator and two zero bytes then closing </code> tag.
