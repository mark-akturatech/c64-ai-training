# 6502 ADDRESSING MODES - Immediate addressing: operand is 1 byte of data (format #aa) indicated by a leading '#'. Examples: LDA #48 loads literal value $48; LDA #'H' uses a character literal.

Immediate		#aa

The operand is a 1 byte data item (not an address).  It is indicated by a hash symbol (#).

LDA	#48	Load the accumulator with the value $48 (which happens to be the ASCII code for H.)
LDA	#’H’	By using single quotes, the assembler will let you use the character itself.
