# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Post-pack bugs: often caused by uninitialized memory assumptions that different packers reveal; try different packers or ensure all memory is initialized before packing.

Everything Works Until I Pack It!
So you get weird bugs after packing your demo? One possibility is a buggy packer. Another is that you're using un-initialized memory. The situation won't be the same after packing, as the memory positions you're counting on always being set to 0 might now have some other value.

If you think the packer or cruncher you're using is buggy, try another one. If your demo looks different with different packers and crunchers, stick to the ones that others recommend. It's not likely that eg. Sledgehammer II or The Cruncher AB have bugs. People have used these tools in thousands of products, so if they'd had bugs people would have discovered and fixed them.
