# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Handle READY return to BASIC after device operations: read I/O status word, mask error bits, branch to error handling if needed. If returning to immediate mode, set the start-of-variables addresses, print 'READY.' and perform the warm start sequence (reset execution state, clear variables, flush stack, rebuild BASIC chain). Otherwise set BASIC execute pointer and rebuild line chaining before returning. (Includes calls to $FFB7, printing READY/OK strings, and jumping to warm start and rebuild routines.)
