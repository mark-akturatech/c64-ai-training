# MACHINE - Zero-page addressing targets addresses $0000-$00FF using a single byte operand (e.g., LDA $90) which is smaller and faster. Zero page is heavily used for system variables and special addressing modes; it's a limited resource often conserved.



Zero-Page Mode
--------------

A hexadecimal address such as $0381 is sixteen bits long and takes up two
bytes of memory.  We call the high byte (in this case, $03), the "memory
page" of the address.  We might say (but usually don't) that this address is
in page 3 at position $81.

  Figure 5.2  Zero-Page Mode Specifies A Single Address from $00 to $FF.


Addresses such as $004C and $00F7 are in page zero; in fact, page zero
consists of all addresses from $0000 to $00FF.  Page-zero locations are very
popular and quite busy.  There's an address mode specifically designed to
quickly get to these locations:  zero-page addressing.  We may think of it as
a short address, and omit the first two digits.  Instead of coding LDA $0090,
we may write LDA $90, and the resulting code will occupy less space and run
slightly faster.

Zero-page locations are so popular that we'll have a hard time finding spare
locations for our own programs.  As a result, we tend to conserve zero-page
locations on Commodore machines.  We'll need the few that are available for a
special addressing mode, indirect, indexed, that will be discussed later.

There are many locations in zero page that are useful to read.  For example,
the BASIC system variable ST, which is important in input/output handling,
may be examined there (location $96 in PET/CBM, location $90 in VIC-20 and
Commodore 64).  If you need to know whether the user is holding down a key,
there's an address in zero page that will tell you that (location $97 in
PET/CBM, $CB in VIC and 64).

Zero-page addressing, like absolute addressing, references one location only.
It's good for a specific value; but for a range of values we need something
more.
