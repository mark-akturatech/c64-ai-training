# COMMODORE 64 - Explains the spritemaking grid (24x21) and how each of the 504 pixels is grouped into 63 bytes (3 groups of 8 columns per row). Describes the 'coloring book' analogy for drawing sprites and references the spritemaking grid figure (blank sprite grid).


  DRAWING A SPRITE

    Drawing a Commodore sprite is like coloring the empty spaces in a
  coloring book. Every sprite consists of tiny dots called pixels. To draw
  a sprite, all you have to do is "color in" some of the pixels.
    Look at the spritemaking grid in Figure 3-6. This is what a blank
  sprite looks like:











                        [THE PICTURE IS MISSING!]













                      Figure 3-6. Spritemaking grid.


  Each little "square" represents one pixel in the sprite. There are 24
  pixels across and 21 pixels up and down, or 504 pixels in the entire
  sprite. To make the sprite look like something, you have to color in
  these pixels using a special PROGRAM... but how can you control over 500
  individual pixels? That's where computer programming can help you. In-
  stead of typing 504 separate numbers, you only have to type 63 numbers
  for each sprite. Here's how it works...
