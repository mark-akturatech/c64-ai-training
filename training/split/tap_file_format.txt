# Datassette Encoding - TAP file format (Per Hakan Sundell, 1997): TAP digitally stores single-pulse time lengths. Each nonzero TAP byte encodes pulse length as Pulse length (microseconds) * C64 PAL frequency / 8, equivalently Pulse length (µs) * 0.123156. Standard CBM pulse TAP values (using PAL-based reference): Short ≈ 43 ($2B), Medium ≈ 63 ($3F), Long ≈ 83 ($53).

TAP File Format
---------------

The TAP file format (designed by Per Hakan Sundell, 1997) digitally represents
tape pulses. Each nonzero byte represents the time length of a single pulse:

    TAP Data Byte = Pulse length (microseconds) * C64 PAL Frequency / 8
    TAP Data Byte = Pulse length (microseconds) * 0.123156

Standard CBM pulses in TAP values:

    Short:  352 * 0.123156 = 43  ($2B)
    Medium: 512 * 0.123156 = 63  ($3F)
    Long:   672 * 0.123156 = 83  ($53)
