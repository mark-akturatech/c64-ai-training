Sprite, Char, Graphics editors
Well, if you're going to make your own graphics, you need editors to produce them. Everything you need is available. If you have the opportunity, get your hands on everything you can find and try everything out. After a while you'll have found some good editors, that you can use. Of course, this goes for all kinds of tools.

The basic stuff you'll need is editors for multi- and single-colour bitmaps, fonts sprites etc. There are also all sorts of conversion programs, to convert between different formats. And as if that wasn't enough, there are also editors for special purpose formats, like combinations of bitmaps and sprites. Some of them can even give you ideas for new effects...
