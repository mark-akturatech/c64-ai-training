# COMMODORE 64 - Full 'Michael's Dancing Mouse' example with explanation and a complete BASIC program that uses three sprites for animation and sound. Covers setup POKEs to sprite pointers and hardware ($D400-style pokes shown as POKES+ offsets and base addresses like 54272 and 53248), loops that move sprites across the screen (including high/low X byte management), conditional calls to sound subroutines, timing delays (POKE 2040,p), and DATA blocks (lines 100–109) that hold sprite bitmaps. Also includes subroutines at lines 200 and 300 that toggle sprite pointer bytes. The listing shows how to load sprites into memory ranges (e.g., 12288–12478) and how the animation main loop is structured.

  THE DANCING MOUSE-A SPRITE PROGRAM EXAMPLE

    Sometimes the techniques described in a programmer's reference manual
  are difficult to understand, so we've put together a fun sprite program
  called "Michael's Dancing Mouse." This program uses three different
  sprites in a cute animation with sound effects-and to help you understand
  how it works we've included an explanation of EACH COMMAND so you can see
  exactly how the program is constructed:
