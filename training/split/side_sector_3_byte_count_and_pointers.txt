# byRiclianll - Analysis of side sector #3 bytes: Byte 1 shows a byte count of 159 ($9F); bytes 16-255 in a side sector are a list of track/sector pointers for up to 120 data blocks; bytes 158 and 159 (interpreted together) point to the last block of the sequential data file (track 23 / $17, sector 12 / $0C); the remainder of the side sector is padded with nulls until the relative file grows. Explains how bytes 160/161 will point to further track/sector pairs, and that when side sector #3 fills, a new side sector #4 is allocated and bytes 0/1 in side sector #3 will then point to side sector #4; additionally bytes 12/13 in side sectors 0–2 will be updated to reflect creation of side sector #4.

Hold  it  right  there  please.  Bytes  0  and  1  should  look  familiar  by  now.  Still  thinking? 
(Hint:  End  of  chain  and  a  byte  count.)

Byte  1  of  side  sector  3  shows  a  byte  count  of  159  ($9F).  Recall  that  bytes  16-255  in  a 
side  sector  are  a  list  of  track  and  sector  pointers  to  120  data  blocks.  As  a  result,  bytes 
158  and  159  must  be  interpreted  together.  They  point  to  the  last  block  in  our  sequential 
data  file  in  this  instance.  The  last  block  is  stored  on  track  23  ($17),  sector  12  ($0C).  Notice 
too,  that  the  remainder  of  the  side  sector  is  padded  with  nulls.  The  remaining  96  bytes 
are  in  limbo  until  our  relative  file  is  expanded.  Bytes  160  and  161  will  then  point  to  the 
next  track  and  sector  of  data  and  so  on.  When  side  sector  3  is  full,  a  new  side  sector 
will  be  created.  Bytes  0  and  1  of  side  sector  3  will  then  point  to  side  sector  4.  Bytes 
12  and  13  in  side  sectors  0,  1,  and  2  will  also  be  updated  to  reflect  the  creation  of  side 
sector  4.
