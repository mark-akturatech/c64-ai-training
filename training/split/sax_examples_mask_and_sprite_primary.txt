# NMOS 6510 - Practical SAX examples: 1) "store values with mask" — using LDX to set up a mask and SAX $80,y to store A & X from memory; 2) "update Sprite Pointers" — a compact sequence demonstrating setting eight sprite pointers using SAX and STA (loads of A and X values, SAX to store masked pointer bytes, and subsequent STA), with comments showing resulting stored byte values.


Example: store values with mask

This opcode is ideal to set up a permanent mask and store values combined with that mask:
LDX #$aa

;set up mask

LDA $1000,y

;load A

SAX $80,y

;store A & $aa

Example: update Sprite Pointers

Often you need to set up all 8 sprite pointers in as few cycles as possible, this could be done like
this:
LDA #$01

;A=%00000001

LDX #$fe

;X=%11111110

SAX screen + $3f8

;$00

STA screen + $3f9

;$01

LDA #$03

;A=%00000011

SAX screen + $3fa

;$02

STA screen + $3fb

;$03

LDA #$05

;A=%00000101

SAX screen + $3fc

;$04

STA screen + $3fd

;$05

LDA #$07

;A=%00000111

SAX screen + $3fe

;$06

STA screen + $3ff

;$07
