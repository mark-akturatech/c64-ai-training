# MACHINE - Machine language monitor .S save format: .S"NAME",device,begin,end+1 (e.g., .S"PROGRAM",01,033C,0361). For disk .S include drive (e.g., .S"0:PROGRAM",08,033C,0361). Note on LOAD from BASIC: use LOAD with ,1 flag to prevent relocation on VIC/C64 (LOAD"PROGRAM",8,1). .L monitor command may load without relocating pointers depending on monitor.

The Machine Language Monitor SAVE
---------------------------------

Now that we're becoming aware of the SOV pitfall, we're ready to discuss how
to save a program in machine language.  You probably understand why I've
been delaying this command until this time.  The MLM save command typically
goes

  .S"PROGRAM",01,033C,0361

This would be the tape format.  The command is .S and is followed by the
program name.  The device is tape, so we type 01--be sure to give two digits.
Next comes the beginning address (in the example $033C) followed by the end
address plus one.  In the last example, the last location saved will be
$0360.  For disk saves, we might want to add the drive number:

                                                                        :100:

  .S"0:PROGRAM",08,033C,0361

These programs, once saved, may be loaded directly from BASIC, but watch the
SOV carefully.  VIC-20 and Commodore 64 BASIC LOAD commands should contain
the extra field to defeat relocation:  LOAD"PROGRAM",8,1 will insist that the
program load back into the same memory locations from which it was saved.
