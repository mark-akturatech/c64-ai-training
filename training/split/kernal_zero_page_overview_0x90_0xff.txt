Location Range: 144-255 ($90-$FF)
Kernal Work Storage Area

This is the zero-page storage area for the Kernal.  The user should
take into account what effect changing a location here will have on
the operation of the Kernal functions before making any such changes.

At power-on, this range of locations is first filled with zeros, and
then initialized from values stored in ROM as needed.
