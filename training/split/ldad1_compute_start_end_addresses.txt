# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL ROM Disassembly (English, "CBM") - LDAD1 - Compute and store start/end addresses for header blocks: calls ZZZ to get the cassette pointer, saves the low start byte (STAL), computes the end-pointer by adding BUFSZ (ADC #$C0) to the start low byte and stores EAL, saves the high start byte (STAH) and computes/stores EAH (handles carry from the low-byte ADC). Leaves pointer bytes in STAL/STAH and EAL/EAH for header writing.
