# byRiclianll - Converts the assembled data block into GCR (Group Code Recording) encoding by calling ROM routines. Initializes pointers/zero page ($30/$31), calls JSR *FE30, restores registers (PLA/TAY/DEY) and calls additional ROM routines (*FDE5, *FDF5, *F5E9, *F78F). Stores conversion results into zero-page locations like *3A.
