# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Setup to round FAC1 by adding 0.5: loads the low/high bytes of a memory pointer pointing at the 0.5 constant and jumps to the routine that adds the memory (AY) operand to FAC1. Includes the blank/separator line after the comment.

                                *** add 0.5 to FAC1 (round FAC1)
.,B849 A9 11    LDA #$11        set 0.5 pointer low byte
.,B84B A0 BF    LDY #$BF        set 0.5 pointer high byte
.,B84D 4C 67 B8 JMP $B867       add (AY) to FAC1
