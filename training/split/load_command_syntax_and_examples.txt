# ********* - Section 3.2: LOAD command format (LOAD name$, device#, command#), explanation of name string, device number (default 8), command number (0 vs 1) and examples demonstrating usage including machine language loads (command# 1) and variable usage.



3.2 LOAD

The BASIC commands used with Programs on the disk drive are the same
as the commands used on the Commodore DATASSETTE-tm recorder.  There
are a few extra commands available for use with disks, however.

First of all, the program name must be given with each command.  On a
DATASSETTE-tm, you could omit the program name in order to just LOAD
the first program there.  On disk, since there are many different
programs that are equally accessible, the program name must be used to
tell the disk drive what to do.  In addition, the disk drive's device
number must be specified.  If no device number is listed, the computer
assumes the program is on tape.

FORMAT FOR THE LOAD COMMAND:

   LOAD name$, device#, command#

The program name is a string, that is, either a name in quotes or the
contents of a given string variable.  Some valid names are: "HELLO",
"PROGRAM #1", A$, NAME$.

The device# is preset on the circuit board to be #8.  If you have more
than one drive, see chapter 9 on how to change the device number. This
book assumes that you're using device number 8 for the disk drive.

The command# is optional.  If not given, or zero, the program is
LOADed normally, that is, beginning at the start of your available
memory for BASIC programs.  If the number is 1, the program will be
LOADed at exactly the same memory locations from which it came.  In
the case of computers with different memory configurations, like VICs
with 5K, 8K, or more memory, the start of BASIC memory is in different
places.  The command# 0 permits BASIC programs to LOAD normally.
Command# 1 is used mainly for machine language, character sets, and
other memory dependent functions.

EXAMPLES

   LOAD "TEST", 8
   LOAD "Program # 1", 8
   LOAD A$, J, K
   LOAD "Mach Lang", 8, 1

NOTE: You can use variables to represent device numbers, commands, and
strings, as long as you've previously defined them in your program.
