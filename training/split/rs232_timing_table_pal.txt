# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - RS232 timing prescaler table for PAL machines (prescaler values for baudrates). Table at $E4EC-$E4FE contains prescalers for 50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 300, 600, 1200, (1800)2400, 2400 baud. NOTE: NTSC table is separate at $FEC2 in KERNAL.

                                *** RS232 TIMING TABLE - PAL
                                Timing table for RS232 NMI for use with PAL machines. This
                                table contains the prescaler values for setting up the
                                RS232 baudrates. The table contains 10 entries which
                                corresponds to one of the fixed RS232 rates, starting with
                                lowest (50 baud) and finishing with the highest (2400
                                baud). Since the clock frequency is different between NTSC
                                and PAL systems, there is another table for NTSC machines
                                at $fec2.
