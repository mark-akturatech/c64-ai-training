# COMMODORE 64 - FREQ LO / FREQ HI (Registers 00,01): Explanation that the two registers form a 16-bit linear frequency control for Oscillator 1; the frequency formula Fout = (Fn * Fclk / 16777216) Hz; example numeric factor for a 1.0 MHz clock (Fout = Fn * 0.059604645 Hz); note on resolution, suitability for musical tuning, portamento, and reference to Appendix E for a complete table.


    Together these registers form a 16-bit number which linearly controls
  the frequency of Oscillator 1 . The frequency is determined by the
  following equation:

                       Fout = (Fn*Fclk/16777216) Hz

    Where Fn is the 16-bit number in the Frequency registers and Fclk is
  the system clock applied to the 02 input (pin 6). For a standard 1.0-MHz
  clock, the frequency is given by:

                       Fout = (Fn*0.059604645) Hz

    A complete table of values for generating 8 octaves of the equally
  tempered musical scale with concert A (440 Hz) tuning is provided in
  Appendix E. It should be noted that the frequency resolution of SID is
  sufficient for any tuning scale and allows sweeping from note to note
  (portamento) with no discernable frequency steps.
