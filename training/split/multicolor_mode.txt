# Contents - Multicolor text mode: allows 4 colors per character position by using character color and BCOL0 ($D021 background), BCOL1 ($D022), BCOL2 ($D023). Selecting multicolor halves horizontal resolution (each character's pixel width halved) so characters are 4x8 pixel cells. Enable by setting bit 4 of XSCRL ($D012) or using MULTON macro; disable with MULTOF or clearing bit. In text mode, multicolor selection is per-character based on color RAM value >= $08. Bitmap bytes are interpreted as bit pairs; mapping of bit pairs to color sources (00 -> BCOL0, 01 -> BCOL1, etc.) starts here.

MULTICOLOR MODE 

To this point, all of the graphics in the text mode 
have been able to use only two colors for each 
character position on the screen. Normally a video 
game will use many more than two colors. To allow 
more colors to be displayed in a given area on the 
screen, the Commodore 64 has a multicolor mode 
that can be selected. In this mode, the character can 
use the character color and the colors in BCOL0 
($D021— the background color), BCOL1 ($D022), or 
BCOL2 ($D023). Using this mode, each pixel in a 
character location can be one of 4 colors. Unfor- 
tunately, you have to sacrifice 1/2 of the horizontal 
resolution to use this mode. This is usually a 
reasonable sacrifice considering how much more 
color can be used. 

In order to tarn on the multicolor mode, you 
must set bit 4 of the XSCRL ($D012) or use the 
MULTON macro. To turn off the multicolor mode, 
you must clear bit 4 of the XSCRL register or use 
the MULTOF macro. In the text mode, the 
multicolor mode is selected individually for each 
character position on the screen. If the color in col- 
or RAM for a given character position is less than 
8, that character position will be in the standard text 
mode. If the color in color RAM is 8 or greater, that 
character position will be in the multicolor mode. 
This allows you to mix standard and multicolor 
modes on the same screen.
