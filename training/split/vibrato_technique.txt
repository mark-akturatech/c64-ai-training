# SID 6581/8580 Sound Interface Device - Programming Guide - Vibrato via Voice 3 oscillator read ($D41B): set Voice3 low frequency (4-7Hz), triangle waveform, mute Voice3 (bit7 $D418), read $D41B each frame and add a scaled value to target voice's frequency registers to produce pitch oscillation. Depth controlled by scaling/division.

10.1 VIBRATO (Frequency Modulation)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vibrato (rapid frequency variation) is achieved by reading the oscillator 3
output ($D41B) and adding it to another voice's frequency register.

Implementation:
  1. Set Voice 3 to a low frequency (the vibrato rate, typically 4-7 Hz)
  2. Select triangle waveform on Voice 3 (smooth modulation)
  3. Mute Voice 3 audio (bit 7 of $D418 = 1)
  4. In the playback loop, read $D41B
  5. Add (scaled) value to the target voice's frequency registers
  6. The target voice's pitch will oscillate smoothly

The depth of vibrato depends on how much of the modulation value is added.
Dividing the read value reduces the vibrato depth.
