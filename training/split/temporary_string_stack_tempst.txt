# ********* - TEMPST ($19-$21): the temporary string descriptor stack itself. Each 3-byte descriptor stores information about temporary (unnamed) strings—examples include literal strings in PRINT statements. The three bytes capture the string length and starting/ending displacements within BASIC string storage.

25-33         $19-$21        TEMPST
Descriptor Stack for Temporary Strings

The temporary string descriptor stack contains information about
temporary strings which hve not yet been assigned to a string
variable.  An examples of such a temporary string is the literal
string "HELLO" in the statement PRINT "HELLO".

Each three-byte descriptor in this stack contains the length of the
string, and its starting and ending locations, expresses as
displacements within the BASIC storage area.
