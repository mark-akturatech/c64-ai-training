# Contents - First half of Table 3-1 showing the mapping of 4-bit binary patterns (nibbles) to their decimal and hexadecimal equivalents for values 0 through 7. This section contains the rows and bit columns corresponding to the lower nibble values and demonstrates how binary bit weights add to form the decimal values and hex digits for 0x0–0x7.
