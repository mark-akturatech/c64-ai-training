Description

floor(x)

Rounds down to the nearest integer.

hypot(a,b)

Returns sqrt(x2+y2).

IEEEremainder(x,y)

Returns the remainder of the two numbers as described
in the IEEE 754 standard.

log(x)

Returns the natural logarithm of x.

log10(x)

Returns the base 10 logarithm of x.

log1p(x)

Returns log(x+1).

max(x,y)

Returns the highest number of x and y.

min(x,y)

Returns the smallest number of x and y.

mod(a,b)

Converts a and b to integers and returns the remainder
of a/b.

pow(x,y)

Returns x raised to the power of y.
