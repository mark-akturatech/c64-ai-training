# ********* - BASIC program text memory area (locations 2048-40959 / $800-$9FFF): stores tokenized BASIC program lines as linked records (next-line pointer low/high, two-byte line number low/high, tokenized program commands, terminated by 0). Describes tokenization (keywords stored as single bytes >=128), and layout of BASIC memory: program text, non-array variables and string descriptors, array variables, free area (FRE(0)), string text area (grows down), BASIC ROM. Notes that NEW does not zero text but replaces first link pointer with zeros allowing program recovery.

BASIC Program Text

This is the area where the actual BASIC program text is stored.  The
text of a BASIC program consists of linked lines of program tokens.
Each line contains the following:

1.  A two-byte pointer to the address of the next program line (in
standard low-byte, high-byte order).  After the last program line, a
link pointer consisting of two zeros marks the end of the program.

2.  A two-byte line number (also in low-byte, high-byte order).

3.  The program commands.  Each keyword is stored as a one-byte
character whose value is equal to or greater than 128.  Print, for
example, is stored as the number 151.  Other elements of the BASIC
command, such as the variable names, string literals ("HELLO"), and
numbers, are stored using their ASCII equivalents.

4.  A 0 character, which acts as a line terminator.  In order for
BASIC to work correctly, the first character of the BASIC text area
must be 0.
