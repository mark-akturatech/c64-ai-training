# ********* - Section 3.5: SAVE command format (SAVE name$, device#, command#), how DOS chooses directory entries and blocks when saving, checks performed (directory existence, BAM availability), and error light behavior when save fails.




3.5 SAVE

To SAVE a program to the diskette, all that is needed is to add the
device number after the program name.  Just like the SAVE command for
the tape deck, the device number can be followed by a command number,
to prevent the automatic re-location on LOADing (see the section on
the LOAD command, above).

FORMAT FOR THE SAVE COMMAND:

   SAVE name$, device#, command#

See the LOAD command (section 3.3) for an explanation of the
parameters device# and command#.

When you tell the disk drive to SAVE a program, the DOS must take
several steps.  First, it looks at the directory to see if a program
with that name already exists. Next it checks to see that there is a
directory entry available for the name.  Then it checks the BAM to see
if there are enough blocks in which to store the program.  If
everything is OK up to this point, the program is stored.  If not, the
error light will flash.
