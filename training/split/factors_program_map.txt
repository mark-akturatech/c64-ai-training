# MACHINE - FACTORS program map: addresses and short descriptions of major routines. Main routine at $1300 (start/clear work area), input handling at $131D-$133A, factoring routines start $1350 (initial divisors) and $1365 (higher divisors), printing and division routines in the $13xx-$15xx ranges (including multiply-by-two $140B, division $1415, printing and formatting routines up to $1565 for 30-count values).
