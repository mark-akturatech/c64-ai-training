# MACHINE - Describes monitor assembler extensions: many machine-language monitors include an .A assemble command; some built-in monitors (PET/CBM) need extensions; assemblers are typically nonsymbolic (require numeric addresses rather than labels).

Monitor Extensions
------------------

We could repeat the steps of the previous chapter:  hand-assembling the
source code into machine language, and then placing it into memory.  We would
need to know the instruction codes, and then do a careful translation.  But
there's an easier way.

Most machine language monitors contain extra commands to help us do this type
of mechanical translation.  We'll use the assembler feature of these
monitors.

Most monitors contain the assemble (.A) command.  The notable exception is
the built-in monitors with the PET/CBM; these, however, can be extended by
loading in a "monitor extension" program such as Supermon.  The Commodore
PLUS/4 series contains an extended monitor, which includes the .A command.

These assemblers are often called nonsymbolic assemblers.  This means that
whenever an address is needed, you must furnish that exact address.  You
cannot type in a name such as CHROUT and expect the tiny assembler to know
what address that represents; instead, you must type $FFD2.
