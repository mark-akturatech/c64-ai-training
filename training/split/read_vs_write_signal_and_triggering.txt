# Datassette Encoding - Behavior of read vs write signals and how the C64 senses tape pulses: the read signal is the inverse of the write signal; pulse width measurements use rising edges for write and falling edges for read. The C64 monitors zero-crossings (high-to-low transitions) on the cassette read line connected to CIA #1 FLAG; each trigger generates an interrupt request.

Read vs Write Signal
--------------------

The read signal inverts the write signal. Pulse width measurement differs:
rising edges for write, falling edges for read.

The C64 senses triggers (zero-crossings from high to low) on the CIA #1
FLAG line, which is connected to the cassette read line of the cassette port.
Each trigger generates an interrupt request.
