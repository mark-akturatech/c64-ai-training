# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Cross assemblers on other platforms and emulators (VICE) are usable, but always test on real hardware because some VIC bugs and sprite behavior aren't perfectly emulated.

Cross Assemblers and Emulators
You can also use a cross assembler, which is a program that does the assembly for you on some other computer, like an Amiga or a PC, and then you can transfer the machine code to your C-64 and run it. You can also run your code in an emulator (preferably VICE), instead of on a real C-64. You should always test your code on the real thing before releasing, though, because there are some things that the emulators still can't emulate (like the $d020 bug and some sprite stuff).
