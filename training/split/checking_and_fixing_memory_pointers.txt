# MACHINE - How to inspect and fix pointers: use monitor .M to display pointer ranges (e.g., .M 002B 003A for VIC/64). Modify incorrect pointer bytes by editing and pressing RETURN. Always verify SOV is sound before running ML/BASIC combos.

                                                                        :102:

Review:  Fixing Pointers
------------------------

If in doubt, examine the pointers by displaying them with a .M command.  For
VIC/64/PLUS/4, the command would be .M 002B 003A; with PET/CBM, use .M 0028
0037; in either case, be sure that the start-of-variables pointer is set to a
"sound" value.

As always, you can change an incorrect memory value--in this case, an
incorrect vector--by moving the cursor back, typing over the values to be
changed, and pressing RETURN.
