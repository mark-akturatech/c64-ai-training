# Architecture of 6502 Microprocessor - Carry Flag (C). Set when an operation produces a carry out of the most significant bit (bit 7) or a borrow underflow from bit 0. Affected by arithmetic, comparison, and logical shift instructions. Can be explicitly set with SEC and cleared with CLC.



Carry Flag	C

The carry flag is set if the last operation caused an overflow from the most significant bit (bit 7) of the result or an underflow from the least significant bit (bit 0). 

This condition is set during arithmetic instructions, comparison instructions and during logical shifts.  It can be explicitly set using the 'Set Carry Flag' (SEC) instruction and cleared with 'Clear Carry Flag' (CLC).
