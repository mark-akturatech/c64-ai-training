# ********* - GIVAYF: Convert a 16-bit signed integer to a floating-point value (routine at $B391). Treats Accumulator as high byte and Y as low byte of a signed 16-bit integer, converts it into the Floating Point Accumulator, and notes that the RAM vector at 5-6 points to this routine so it can be used to return USR-call arguments in the floating-point accumulator. Includes the following blank line.

Convert 16-Bit Signed Integer to Floating Point

This routine treats the value in the Accumulator as the high byte of a
16-bit signed integer, and the value in the .Y register as the low
byte, and converts the signed integer into a floating point number in
the Floating Point Accumulator.

The address of this routine is pointed to by the RAM vector at 5-6,
and the routine can be used to return an argument from the USR call in
the Floating Point Accumulator.
