  COLORS

    A sprite can be any of the 16 colors generated by the VIC-II chip. Each
  of the sprites has its own sprite color register. These are the memory
  locations of the color registers:

            ADDRESS         |          DESCRIPTION
  --------------------------+----------------------------------------------
        53287   ($D027)     |    SPRITE 0 COLOR REGISTER
        53288   ($D028)     |    SPRITE 1 COLOR REGISTER
        53289   ($D029)     |    SPRITE 2 COLOR REGISTER
        53290   ($D02A)     |    SPRITE 3 COLOR REGISTER

  sprite color register. The rest of the sprite will be transparent, and
  will show whatever is behind the sprite.
