# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - SETNAM: Save filename data (vectored from $ffbd). On entry A contains filename length, X/Y the pointer to filename in memory. Stores FNLEN ($B7), FNADR ($BB/$BC) and returns. Uses STA/STX/STY to zero page.

                                *** SETNAM: SAVE FILENAME DATA
                                The KERNAL routine SETNAM ($ffbd) jumps to this routine.
                                On entry, A-reg holds the length of the filename, and X/Y
                                the address in mem to the filename.
