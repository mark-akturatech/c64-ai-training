# MACHINE - Chapter 5 header: addressing modes to be discussed including implied/accumulator, immediate, absolute/zero-page, indexing, relative branches, indirect, indirect-indexed, and indexed-indirect.

By now, you should have developed skills with the machine language monitor
and feel much more comfortable zipping in and out.  These skills are not
difficult, but they are important to the beginner.  Without them, you can
never get comfortably into the real meat:  how to code machine language
itself.

          This chapter discusses:

            o Non-addresses:  implied, immediate, register

            o Absolute and zero-page

            o Indexing

            o The relative address for branches

            o Indirect addressing

            o Indirect, indexed
