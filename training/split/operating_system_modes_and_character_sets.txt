# COMMODORE 64 - Description of DIRECT vs PROGRAM modes of BASIC, and the two internal character sets (SET 1 and SET 2) behavior: SHIFT and C= keys usage to access graphics and upper/lower case; how to switch sets (C= + SHIFT).


    The Operating System gives you two modes of BASIC operation:

    1) DIRECT Mode
    2) PROGRAM Mode

    1) When you're using the DIRECT mode, BASIC statements don't have
       line numbers in front of the statement. They are executed whenever
       the <RETURN> key is pressed.
    2) The PROGRAM mode is the one you use for running programs.

       When using the PROGRAM mode, all of your BASIC statements must have
       line numbers in front of them. You can have more than one BASIC
       statement in a line of your program, but the number of statements is
       limited by the fact that you can only put 80 characters on a logical
       screen line. This means that if you are going to go over the 80
       character limit you have to put the entire BASIC statement that
       doesn't fit on a new line with a new line number.

         Always type NEW and hit <RETURN> before starting a new program.

    The Commodore 64 has two complete character sets that you can use
  either from the keyboard or in your programs.
    In SET 1, the upper case alphabet and the numbers 0-9 are available
  without pressing the <SHIFT> key. If you hold down the <SHIFT> key
  while typing, the graphics characters on the RIGHT side of the front of
  the keys are used. If you hold down the <C=> key while typing, the
  graphics characters on the LEFT side of the front of the key are used.
  Holding down the <SHIFT> key while typing any character that doesn't
  have graphic symbols on the front of the key gives you the symbol on the
  top most part of the key.
    In SET 2, the lower case alphabet and the numbers 0-9 are available
  without pressing the <SHIFT> key. The upper case alphabet is available
  when you hold down the <SHIFT> key while typing. Again, the graphic
  symbols on the LEFT side of the front of the keys are displayed by press-
  ing the <C=> key, while the symbols on the top most part of any key
  without graphics characters are selected when you hold down the <SHIFT>
  key while typing.
    To switch from one character set to the other press the <C=> and
  the <SHIFT> keys together.
