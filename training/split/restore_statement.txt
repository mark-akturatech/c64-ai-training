# COMMODORE 64 - RESTORE: resets BASIC internal pointer for DATA to the first DATA constant so subsequent READs re-read DATA from beginning. Examples showing using RESTORE to fill two arrays with identical data.

  EXAMPLES of REM Statement:

    10 REM CALCULATE AVERAGE VELOCITY
    20 FOR X= 1 TO 20 :REM LOOP FOR TWENTY VALUES
    30 SUM=SUM + VEL(X): NEXT
    40 AVG=SUM/20



  RESTORE

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: RESTORE


    Action: BASIC maintains an internal pointer to the next DATA constant
  to be READ. This pointer can be reset to the first DATA constant in a
  program using the RESTORE statement. The RESTORE statement can be
  used anywhere in the program to begin re-READing DATA.


  EXAMPLES of RESTORE Statement:

    100 FOR X=1 TO 10: READ A(X): NEXT
    200 RESTORE
    300 FOR Y=1 TO 10: READ B(Y): NEXT

    4000 DATA 3.08, 5.19, 3.12, 3.98, 4.24
    4100 DATA 5.08, 5.55, 4.00, 3.16, 3.37

    (Fills the two arrays with identical data)

    10 DATA 1,2,3,4
    20 DATA 5,6,7,8
    30 FOR L= 1 TO 8
    40 READ A: PRINT A
    50 NEXT
    60 RESTORE
    70 FOR L= 1 TO 8
    80 READ A: PRINT A
    90 NEXT
