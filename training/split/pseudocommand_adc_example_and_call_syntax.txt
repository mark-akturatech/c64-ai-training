# Kick Assembler - Notes on argument separation (colon), backward-compatibility with v3.x (use -pseudoc3x or converter), optional leading colon to call commands with mnemonic names, and an example .pseudocommand adc showing behavior versus the standard mnemonic with example calls.

The arguments to a pseudo command are separated by colon and you can use any argument you would give
to a mnemonic.
Note: In version 3.x, arguments where separated by semicolon. To make old code compile use the -pseudoc3x
commandline option or convert the code with the 3.x to 4.x converter.
You can add an optional colon in front of the pseudocommand calls. This enables you to call a command with
the same name as a mnemonic.
