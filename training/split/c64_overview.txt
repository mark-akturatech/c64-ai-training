# The MOS 6567/6569 video controller (VIC-II) and its application in the Commodore 64 - High-level architecture of the Commodore 64: list of main components (6510 CPU, 6567/6569 VIC-II, 6581 SID, two 6526 CIA, 64KB DRAM, 1KB Color RAM, 16KB/4KB ROMs). Notes on NMOS implementation.

2. The architecture of the Commodore 64
---------------------------------------

This chapter gives an overview of the basic hardware architecture of the
C64 and the integration of the VIC into the system.

2.1. Overview
-------------

The C64 basically consists of the following units:

 � 6510 8 bit microprocessor
 � 6567/6569 VIC-II graphics chip
 � 6581 SID sound chip
 � Two 6526 CIA I/O chips
 � 64KB DRAM (64K*8 bit) main memory
 � 0.5KB SRAM (1K*4 bit) Color RAM
 � 16KB ROM (16K*8 bit) for operating system and BASIC interpreter
 � 4KB ROM (4K*8 bit) character generator

Most chips are manufactured in NMOS technology.
