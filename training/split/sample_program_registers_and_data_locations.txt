# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Details of the sample program's data tables: which VIC-II registers are POKEd during each interrupt (Control Register 1 $D011, Control Register 2 $D016, Memory Control $D018, Background Color 0 $D021), explanation that the interrupt routine POKEs entries into four key locations during each interrupt, and that the machine-code/data block is stored at addresses corresponding to BASIC line numbers 49152-49276.

                          The interrupt uses a table of values that are POKEd into four key
                          locations during each of the three interrupts, as well as values to
                          determine at what scan lines the interrupt will occur.  The locations
                          affected are Control Register 1 (53265, $D011), Control Register 2
                          (53270, $D016), the Memory Control Register (53272, $D018), and
                          Background Color 0 (53281, $D021).  The data for the interrupt routine
                          is contained in lines 49152-49276.  Each of these line numbers
                          corresponds to the locations where the first data byte in the
                          statement is POKEd into memory.

                          If you look at lines 49264-49276 of the BASIC program, you will see
                          REMark statements that explain which VIC-II registers are affected by
                          the DATA statements in each line.  The number in these DATA
                          statements appear in the reverse order in which they are put into the
                          VIC register.  For example, line 49273 holds the data that will go
                          into Control Register 2.  The last number, 8, is the one that will be
                          placed into Control Register 2 while the top part of the screen is
                          displayed.  The first number, 24, is placed into Control Register 2
                          during the bottom part of the screen display, and changes that portion
                          of the display to multicolor mode.
