# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Data constants used as thresholds for deciding when to use scientific notation: three numeric constants (represented in ROM bytes) corresponding to maximum values allowing decimals, maximum value before switching to scientific notation, and the 1,000,000,000 boundary.

                                *** limits for scientific mode
.:BDB3 9B 3E BC 1F FD           99999999.90625, maximum value with at least one decimal
.:BDB8 9E 6E 6B 27 FD           999999999.25, maximum value before scientific notation
.:BDBD 9E 6E 6B 28 00           1000000000
