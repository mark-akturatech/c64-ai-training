# Kick Assembler - Section 8.5: Boolean operators available to the preprocessor (#if/#elif/#importif) — !, &&, ||, ==, != and parentheses, examples combining symbols and operators and sample uses with #importif.

A symbol works like a boolean. Either its defined or its not. The #if, #elif and #importif directives takes an
expression that contains symbols and operators and returns either true of false. Here are some examples:
#if !DEBUG && !COMPLICATED
// some stuff
#endif
#if DEBUG || (X && Y && Z) || X==DEBUG
// Note that you can also use parenthesis#
#importif DEBUG&&STANDALONE "UpstartWithDebug.asm"

Here is a list of operators:
