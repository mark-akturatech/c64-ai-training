# Kick Assembler - Chapter 10 introduction to segments. Describes segments as lists of memory blocks used to organize code/data and define ordering. Explains modifiers, combining segments, directing output to files/disks, and backward compatibility (default segment). Shows a simple example writing a section to a separate file: .segment File1 [outPrg="MyFile.prg"] *=$1000 lda #00 ... .segment Default

.segment BANK4
..code for segment 4 goes here...

A segment is set up for each bank and they are output in the right order to a binary file. The code in the 4
segments is restricted to the address space $1000-$1fff. Notice how the same address space can be used multiple
times, since the code resides in different segments.

10.3. Segments
In Kick Assembler, a segment is a list of memory blocks, so let's look at these first.
A memory block is generated each time you use the *= directive. It has a start, an optional name and might
be marked as virtual. If you add code without defining a memory block first, a default block is created for you.
Here are examples of memory blocks.
inc $d020
jmp *-3

// This create a default memory block
