# Contents - Graphics planning: decide on graphics mode and colors beforehand, consider common colors for multicolor sprites and character shapes, and use the provided sample layout sheets for pixel-accurate design.



Before you sit down to enter graphics data, you 
should have a good idea of what you want the final 
object to look like. You will need to know the 
graphics mode that you will be working in. Also, 
you must decide what colors you are going to use. 
For instance, if you are using multicolored sprites, 
each sprite can have one color of its own and can 
use 2 colors that are common to all the other sprites. 
To ensure that you will have the proper colors 
available to you, it would wise to have decided 
how all of the characters should look before you 
start. 

Once you have chosen a graphics mode to work 
in, you will be able to start drawing your characters. 
In Figs. 9-1 through 9-7 you will find some sample 
graphics layout sheets. These sheets have a fine grid 
that is proportional to the dimensions of a pixel on 
the TV screen. The heavy grid is proportional to 
one character cell on the screen. There are 25 lines 
of 40 characters each on the Commodore 64.
