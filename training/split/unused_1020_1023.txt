# ********* - Locations 1020-1023 ($3FC-$3FF): four unused bytes available to programs.

the actual data byte written by the PRINT #1 command, and read by the
GET #1 and INPUT #1 commands.  Unlike the body of a program file,
these blocks are temporarily stored in the cassette byffer when being
written or read.

An identifier byte of 5 indicates that this block is the logical end
of the tape.  This signals the Kernal not to search past this point,
even if there are additional tape blocks physically present on the
tape.
