# byRiclianll - Section 2.4: Four-step recipe to use the command channel from BASIC: (1) OPEN the channel, (2) send commands with PRINT#, (3) read messages with GET# or INPUT#, (4) CLOSE the channel.

2.4  Using  the  Command  Channel 


Using  the  command  channel  is  easy.  Just  follow  these  steps: 

1.  Establish  communications  using  an  OPEN  statement. 

2.  Send  commands  to  the  DOS  using  a  PR1NT#  statement. 

3.  Read  DOS  messages  using  a  GET#  or  INPUT#  statement. 

4.  Close  the  channel  using  a  CLOSE  statement  when  you  are  finished. 

Let's  go  over  each  step  to  ensure  that  you  know  exactly  what  to  do.
