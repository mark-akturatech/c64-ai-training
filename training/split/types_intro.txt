# NMOS 6510 - Classification of unintended opcode types: combinations of two operations with same addressing mode (e.g., SLO = ASL + ORA, RLA = ROL + AND, SRE = LSR + EOR, RRA = ROR + ADC, SAX = STA + STX, LAX = LDA + LDX, DCP = DEC + CMP, ISC = INC + SBC), combinations of immediate and implied commands (ANE, LAX #imm, ANC, ALR, ARR, SBX), and special STA/STX/STY combos (SHA/SHX/SHY) and TAS/LAS behavior.

SRE {addr} LSR {addr} + EOR {addr}
RRA {addr} ROR {addr} + ADC {addr}
SAX {addr} STA {addr} + STX {addr}

store A & X into {addr}

LAX {addr} LDA {addr} + LDX {addr}
DCP {addr} DEC {addr} + CMP {addr}
ISC {addr} INC {addr} + SBC {addr}
