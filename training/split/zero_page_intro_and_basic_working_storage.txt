# ********* - Explains the significance of the 6502/6510 zero page (addresses $00-$FF): shorter/faster access, heavy use by system software, and that locations $00 and $01 are special I/O registers on the 6510. Notes the subsection 0-143 ($00-$8F) is reserved for BASIC working storage and can be used freely by pure machine-language programs that do not interact with BASIC.


Memory locations 0-255 ($0-$FF) have a special significance in 6502
machine language programming (the 6510 microprocessor in the Commodore
64 shares the same instruction set as the 6502).  Since these
addresses cn be expressed using just one byte, instructions which
access data stored in these locations are shorter and execute more
quickly than do instructions which operate on addresses in higher
memory, which requires two bytes.

Because of this relatively fast execution time, most 6502 software
makes heavy use of zero-page locations.  The 64 is no exception, and
uses this area for many important system variables and pointers.

In addition, locations 0 and 1 have special Input/Output functions on
the 6510.  In the case of the 64, this on-chip I/O port is used to
select the possible combinations of ROM, as we will se below, and to
control cassette I/O.

Location Range: 0-143 ($0-$8F)
BASIC Working Storage

This portion of zero page is used by BASIC only.  Therefore, a program
written entirely in machine language that does not interact with BASIC
can freely use this area.
