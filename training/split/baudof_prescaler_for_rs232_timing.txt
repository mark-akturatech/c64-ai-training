# ********* - BAUDOF (locations 665-666, $299-$29A): prescaler value used by CIA #2 timers A/B to time RS-232 bit send/receive. Timers trigger NMI-driven RS-232 routines CLOCK/PRESCALER times per second, where CLOCK is system 02 frequency (NTSC 1,022,730 Hz, PAL 985,250 Hz) and PRESCALER is stored in CIA registers at $DD04-$DD07. Formula: PRESCALER = ((CLOCK / BAUDRATE) / 2) - 100. Tables of preset prescalers for NTSC/PAL stored at $FEC2 and $E4EC respectively.

665-666       $299-$29A      BAUDOF
Time Required to Send a Bit

This location holds the prescaler value used by CIA #2 timers A and B.

These timers cause an NMI interrupt to drive the RS-232 receive and
transmit routines CLOCK/PRESCALER times per second each, where CLOCK
is the system 02 frequency of 1,022,730 Hz (985,250 if you are using
the European PAL television standard rather than the American NTSC
standard), and PRESCALER is the value stored at 56580-1 ($DD04-5) and
56582-3 ($DD06-7), in low-byte, high-byte order.  You can use the
following formula to figure the correct prescaler value for a
particular RS-232 baud rate:

PRESCALER=((CLOCK/BAUDRATE)/2)-100

The American (NTSC standard) prescaler values for the standard RS-232
baud rates which the control register at 659 ($293) makes available
are stored in a table at 65218 ($FEC2), starting with the two-byte
value used for 50 baud.  The European (PAL standard) version of that
table is located at 58604 ($E4EC).
