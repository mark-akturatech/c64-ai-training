# A Minimal C64 Datasette Program Loader - Loader disables interrupts (SEI) and turns off the VIC-II screen to prevent cycle stealing: reads $D011 and clears the raster-compare bit ($10) to disable screen updates, stores back to $D011, then waits for new screen by polling $D012 to be zero before proceeding.

Disable interrupts and screen to prevent VIC-II cycle stealing:

    sei
    lda $d011
    and #$ff-$10    ;disable screen
    sta $d011
    m2: lda $d012
        bne m2      ;wait for new screen
