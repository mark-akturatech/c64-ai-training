# Contents - Descriptions of SID registers that affect all three voice channels: FLCNLO (low 3 bits of 11-bit filter frequency), FLCNHI (high 8 bits of 11-bit filter frequency), MODVOL (filtering mode and master volume for all voices), and RESFLT (resonance value and filter enables for all channels).




The following registers affect all three voice channels. 

F hCNLO The least significant 3 bits of this register are the low order 3 bits of an 1 1 bit value 

that controls the filter frequency. 
FLCNHI This register contains the high order 8 bits of an 11 bit value that determines the filter 

frequency. 
MODVOL The filtering mode and the maximum volume for all three voice channels is controlled 

by this register. 
RESFLT This register contains the resonance value and the filter enables for all three channels
