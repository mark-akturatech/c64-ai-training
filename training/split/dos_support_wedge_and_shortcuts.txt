# ********* - Section 3.8: DOS SUPPORT program (wedge) description: convenience keys ("/" for LOAD, "@" and ">" for DOS commands), how it reads the error channel with @ or > and RETURN, and the runtime memory impact of the wedge.


3.8 DOS SUPPORT PROGRAM

On your demonstration disk, there may be a program called DOS SUPPORT.
This program, also called a wedge, allows you to use many disk
commands more easily (different wedges are used for the VIC 20 and the
Commodore 64).  Just LOAD the program and RUN it.  It automatically
sets itself up and erases itself when it's finished. You'll have a few
hundred less bytes to work with when this program is running, but
you'll also have a handy way to send the disk commands.

As a result of the DOS Support, the "/" key now takes the place of the
LOAD command.  Just hit the slash followed by the progrwn name, and
the program is LOADed.  When you use this method, you don't need to
use the LOAD command or the comma 8.

The "@" and ">" keys are used to send commands to the disk drive. If
you type @$ (or > $), the directory of the disk is displayed on the
screen, without LOADing into your memory!  These keys also take the
place of the PRINT# (see chapter 4) to send commands listed in the
next chapter.

To read the error channel of the disk (when the red error light is
blinking), just hit either the @ or the > and hit RETURN Key.  The
complete error message is displayed to you: message number, text, and
track and block numbers.
