# ********* - Section 2.5: Compatibility and speed differences when using the 1541 with VIC-20 vs Commodore 64; commands to switch drive speed (UI- for VIC 20, UI+ for C64); note that drive starts in C64 mode; reference to USER commands in Chapter 8.



2.5 USING WITH A VIC 20 OR COMMODORE 64

The 1541 Disk Drive can work with either the VIC 20 or Commodore 64
computers.  However, each computer has different requirements for
speed of incoming data.  Therefore, there is a software switch for
selecting which computer's speed to use. The drive starts out ready
for a Commodore 64.  To switch to VIC 20 speed, the following command
must be sent after the drive is started (power-on or through
software):

   OPEN 15, 8, 15, "UI-": CLOSE 15

To return the disk drive to Commodore 64 speed, use this command:

   OPEN 15, 8, 15, "UI+": CLOSE 15

More about using this type of command is in chapter 4, with a detailed
explanation of the U (user) commands in chapter 8.
