# ********* - Expanded view of a single 1540/1541 sector layout. Shows sequence and components within a sector: SYNC, ID bytes, track (TK), block (BL), CHECKSUM, GAP 1, followed by an extended continuation showing data area: header byte (07), two BYTE fields (BYTE 0, BYTE 1), 254 bytes of data, CHECK SUM and GAP. This is the on-disk sector format for 1540/1541 single-density sectors.
