# A 256 Byte Autostart Fast Loader for the Commodore 64 - C64 receive routine using reads from $DD00 and shifts/XORs to assemble a byte from four 2-bit transfers. The snippet shows lda $DD00, repeated lsr and eor sequences; total reception costs ~28 cycles enabling ~20,000 bytes/sec theoretically.

Receiving Code (C64 side):

    lda $DD00       ; get bits 6-7
    lsr
    lsr             ; move to bits 4-5
    eor $DD00       ; XOR next 2 bits
    lsr
    lsr             ; shift down
    eor $DD00       ; get more bits
    lsr
    lsr
    eor $DD00       ; final 2 bits

This achieves byte reception in 28 cycles total, enabling approximately
20,000 bytes per second theoretically.
