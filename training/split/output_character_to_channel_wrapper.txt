# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Wrapper at $FFD2 that JMPs ($0326) to output a character to the current output channel (CHROUT). Care advised when sending to serial devices as multiple output channels may receive data.

                                *** output character to channel
                                this routine will output a character to an already opened channel. Use the OPEN
                                routine, $FFC0, and the CHKOUT routine, $FFC9, to set up the output channel
                                before calling this routine. If these calls are omitted, data will be sent to the
                                default output device, device 3, the screen. The data byte to be output is loaded
                                into the accumulator, and this routine is called. The data is then sent to the
                                specified output device. The channel is left open after the call.
                                NOTE: Care must be taken when using routine to send data to a serial device since
                                data will be sent to all open output channels on the bus. Unless this is desired,
                                all open output channels on the serial bus other than the actually intended
                                destination channel must be closed by a call to the KERNAL close channel routine.
