# byRiclianll - Code that constructs sector headers in memory: LDX #0 and a sequence of LDA/STA/INX operations storing header ID bytes and track/sector/ID values into $0300,X. Includes setting fields (HBID, sector, track, IDL, IDH, GAP), and an XOR/EOR-based checksum accumulation followed by INC to update the computed checksum byte(s). Contains a few listing artifacts ('s' and '?') preserved from the original listing.
