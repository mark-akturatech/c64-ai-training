# C64 KERNAL API (Lee Davison) - $FF90 — Control KERNAL messages. Controls printing of error and control messages. A register/accumulator value determines which messages are printed: bits 7 (print error) and 6 (print control). Examples: 'FILE NOT FOUND' (error) and 'PRESS PLAY ON CASSETTE' (control).

$FF90          control kernal messages
               
               This routine controls the printing of error and control messages by the KERNAL.
               Either print error messages or print control messages can be selected by setting
               the accumulator when the routine is called.
               
               FILE NOT FOUND is an example of an error message. PRESS PLAY ON CASSETTE is an
               example of a control message.
               
               Bits 6 and 7 of this value determine where the message will come from. If bit 7
               is set one of the error messages from the KERNAL will be printed. If bit 6 is set
               a control message will be printed.
