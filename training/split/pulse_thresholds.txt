# A Minimal C64 Datasette Program Loader - Thresholds for discriminating pulse types are midpoints between defined lengths: threshold_short_medium = (length_short + length_medium) / 2 and threshold_medium_long = (length_medium + length_long) / 2. These are used to classify measured pulse durations.

Thresholds for differentiating between pulse types:

    threshold_short_medium = (length_short + length_medium) / 2
    threshold_medium_long  = (length_medium + length_long) / 2
