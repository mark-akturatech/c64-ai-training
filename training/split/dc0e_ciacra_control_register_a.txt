$DC0E        CIACRA       Control Register A

                     0    Start Timer A (1=start, 0=stop)
                     1    Select Timer A output on Port B (1=Timer A output appears on Bit 6 of
                            Port B)
                     2    Port B output mode (1=toggle Bit 6, 0=pulse Bit 6 for one cycle)
                     3    Timer A run mode (1=one-shot, 0=continuous)
                     4    Force latched value to be loaded to Timer A counter (1=force load
                            strobe)
                     5    Timer A input mode (1=count microprocessor cycles, 0=count signals on
                            CNT line at pin 4 of User Port)
                     6    Serial Port (56332, $DC0C) mode (1=output, 0=input)
                     7    Time of Day Clock frequency (1=50 Hz required on TOD pin, 0=60 Hz)

                          Bits 0-3.  This nybble controls Timer A.  Bit 0 is set to 1 to start
                          the timer counting down, and set to 0 to stop it.  Bit 3 sets the
                          timer for one-shot or continuous mode.

                          In one-shot mode, the timer counts down to 0, sets the counter value
                          back to the latch value, and then sets Bit 0 back to 0 to stop the
                          timer.  In continuous mode, it reloads the latch value and starts all
                          over again.

                          Bits 1 and 2 allow you to send a signal on Bit 6 of Data Port B when
                          the timer counts.  Setting Bit 1 to 1 forces this output (which
                          overrides the Data Direction Register B Bit 6, and the normal Data
                          Port B value).  Bit 2 allows you to choose the form this output to Bit
                          6 of Data Port B will take.  Setting Bit 2 to a value of 1 will cause
                          Bit 6 to toggle to the opposite value when the timer runs down (a
                          value of 1 will change to 0, and a value of 0 will change to 1).
                          Setting Bit 2 to a value of 0 will cause a single pulse of a one
                          machine-cycle duration (about a millionth of a second) to occur.

                          Bit 4.  This bit is used to load the Timer A counter with the value
                          that was previously written to the Timer Low and High Byte Registers.
                          Writing a 1 to this bit will force the load (although there is no data
                          stored here, and the bit has no significance on a read).

                          Bit 5.  Bit 5 is used to control just what it is Timer A is counting.
                          If this bit is set to 1, it counts the microprocessor machine cycles
                          (which occur at the rate of 1,022,730 cycles per second).  If the bit
                          is set to 0, the timer counts pulses on the CNT line, which is
                          connected to pin 4 of the User Port.  This allows you to use the CIA
                          as a frequency counter or an event counter, or to measure pulse width
                          or delay times of external signals.
