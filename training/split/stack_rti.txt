# NMOS 6510 - RTI (return from interrupt) cycle sequence: opcode fetch, dummy fetch from PC+1, read status and PC low/high from stack, with notes on dummy reads from PC+1 and S+0 and an example of acknowledging CIA interrupts by executing RTI at a CIA vector.

R

2 (*2)

PC + 1

Byte at PC + 1

R

3 (*3)

S – 0

Program counter High

W

4 (*3)

S - 1

Program counter low

W

5 (*3)

S - 2

Status register

W

6

VA

vector address low

R

7

VA + 1

vector address high

R

(*1) Dummy fetch from PC
(*2) Dummy fetch from PC + 1
(*3) R/W remains high during reset, ie reset does not write to the stack
