# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - A 21-line example (63 numbers, three per line) showing how the bytes would be stored to draw a large cross sprite, with the decimal values shown next to their bit patterns.


                          We can put these two kinds of lines together to show how a large cross
                          might be drawn using bytes of sprite data.

                          The 63 numbers, displayed three per line opposite the bit patters they
                          represent, are the values that would have to be put in the sprite
                          shape data area in order to display this cross using sprite graphics.
