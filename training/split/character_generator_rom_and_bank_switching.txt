# Contents - Explains the Commodore 64 built-in character generator ROM and how it interacts with the CPU and VIC. Covers that the character generator ROM is physically at $D000-$DFFF (overlapping the hardware I/O register address range), that bit 2 of the processor I/O port at $01 controls whether the CPU sees the I/O hardware registers (bit=1) or the character generator ROM (bit=0), and that the VIC chip does not use the same $D000 area but instead sees an image of the character generator at $1000-$1FFF and $9000-$AFFF (only when certain memory banks are selected). Also notes that the CPU can use the VIC's character-generator-addressed areas for data without conflict, typical choice of banks (commonly bank 1 or 3) for graphics, and options for using text (copying from the character generator or creating a custom character set).


generator ROM, which is physically at 

SD000-$DFFF. You may have noticed that this is the 
same address range where the hardware registers 
in the Commodore 64 are. This is possible only 
because the hardware registers are not available to 
the microprocessor at the same time as the 
character generate ROM is. Bit 2 of the I/O port at 
SOI controls whether the ROM or hardware 



registers will be available to the microprocessor. 
When this bit is set to a 1 , the hardware registers 
will be available. When this bit is set to 0, the 
character generator ROM can be read by the 
microprocessor. The VIC chip does not see the 
character generator at this address, however. The 
VIC chip has been tricked into seeing the character 
generator from $1000-$1FFF. The VIC chip also 



sees an image of the character generator ROM from 
$9000-$AFFF. Notice that the VIC chip can only 
see an image of the character generator when in 
banks and 2 of memory. The microprocessor does 
not see the character generator in the same place 
that the VIC chip does, so there is no conflict with 
the microprocessor when using one of the areas in 
memory to store data that the VIC chip thinks is 
the character generator. You will normally choose 
either bank 1 or 3 for your graphics, so that the im- 
age of the character generator does not get in your 
way. If you do need to use text in your program, you 
can either copy data out of the character generator 
or create your own character set.
