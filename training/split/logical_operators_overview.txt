# COMMODORE 64 - Logical operators AND, OR, NOT: used to combine relational expressions and perform bitwise operations when operands are integers in range -32768..+32767. Details on conversion from floating point to integer for logical operations and that NOT operates only on its right operand. Nonzero results considered true; exclusive OR (XOR) used by WAIT statement.

  performed only on the single operand to the right. The operands must be
  in the integer range of values (-32768 to +32767) (floating-point
  numbers are converted to integers) and logical operations give an integer
  result.
    Logical operations are performed bit-by-corresponding-bit on the two
  operands. The logical AND produces a bit result of 1 only if both operand
  bits are 1. The logical OR produces a bit result of I if either operand
  bit is 1. The logical NOT is the opposite value of each bit as a single
  operand. In other words, it's really saying, "if it's NOT 1 then it is 0.
  If it's NOT 0 then it is 1."
    The exclusive OR (XOR) doesn't have a logical operator but it is per-
  formed as part of the WAIT statement. Exclusive OR means that if the bits
  of two operands are equal then the result is 0 otherwise the result is 1.
    Logical operations are defined by groups of statements which, taken
  together, constitute a Boolean "truth table" as shown in Table 1-2.
