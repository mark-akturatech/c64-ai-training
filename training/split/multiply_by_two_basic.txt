# 6502 Multiplication and Division Algorithms - Source: llx.com - Introduces multiplying by a constant on the 6502, shows that multiplying by two is the simplest case and provides the single-byte and two-byte implementations using ASL and ROL. Includes the heading and brief note that wider numbers extend similarly.

Multiplying by a Constant
----------------------------------------


Skipping over the trivial cases of multiplying by zero or one, the
easiest constant to multiply by is two, because all you need are the
ASL and ROL instructions.  For a single-byte
result:


ASL NUM


Or for a two-byte result:


ASL NUM
        ROL NUM+1


Extending this to wider numbers should be obvious.
