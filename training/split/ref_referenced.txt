# ca65 Users Guide - Documentation for the .REF / .REFERENCED builtin function: takes an identifier in parentheses, evaluates it, and yields true if that symbol has already been referenced earlier in the source file at the current position, false otherwise. Example usage replacing .IFREF: .if .referenced(a).

10.21 .REF, .REFERENCED
Builtin function. The function expects an identifier as argument in parentheses. The argument is evaluated, and the function yields "true" if the identifier is a symbol that has already been referenced somewhere in the source file up to the current position. Otherwise the function yields false. As an example, the .IFREF statement may be replaced by


        .if     .referenced(a)
