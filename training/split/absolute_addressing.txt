# Contents - Absolute addressing: operand contains a two-byte address (16-bit) allowing access anywhere in $0000-$FFFF. Assembler usually picks zero page form if possible for efficiency.

Absolute Addressing 

Absolute addressing uses a two byte value in 
the operand to generate a 16 bit memory address. 
Due to this, the 6510 can address any byte in the 
range of $0000 to $FFFF. Normally, the assembler 
will select the most efficient version of this instruc- 
tion. If it is possible to use zero page addressing in- 
stead of absolute addressing, the assembler will 
generate this form of the instruction.
