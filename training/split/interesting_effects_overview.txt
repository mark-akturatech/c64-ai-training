# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Intro to demo effects section: lists effects of increasing complexity (text scroller, raster bars, border opening, FLD, sprite multiplexing, FLI/AFLI/IFLI, side border open, plasmas, bumpmapping, 3D) and references that additional code/examples can be found in magazines and referenced docs.

Interesting Effects
In the previous sections I have explained most of the basics that you need to know in order to code your own demos. You might not understand exactly how everything works, but if you've written some code, using the stuff I've explained above, you should have a fairly good grip on the basics.

However, although you now have most of the tools you need to create lots of effects, you might not have figured out exactly how they work. In this section I'll give some examples of cool effects. You can try implementing them yourself, or, even better, use the same concepts to implement something different and more original. But of course, there are some things that everyone who wants to code demos have to do at least once, and most of the below examples should be such things.

I won't give you source code to write all these things. I don't think that should be necessary. You'll also learn a lot by figuring our the details yourself. You can find source code and more details about some of these effects, and others as well, in early issues of Commodore Hacking and all three issues of Coders World (see the References section below).

I'll try to sort these effects in order of increasing complexity, so the first ones should be easy, and the later ones harder. But of course, that's individual. Anyway, text scrollers and raster bars should be easier than displaying a FLI picture or opening the side border.
