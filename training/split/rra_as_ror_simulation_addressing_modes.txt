# NMOS 6510 - Notes on using RRA to simulate extra addressing modes of ROR when clobbering the A register and flags is acceptable: shows that RRA abs,y, RRA (zp),y and RRA (zp,x) behave like ROR with those addressing modes except A and flags are modified due to the subsequent ADC. Mentions that C is shifted into MSB and lists consequences (A changed, N/V/Z/C set by ADC).

Example: simulate extra addressing modes for ROR

If you can afford clobbering A and the flags (or even use the final value), RRA turns into ROR and
makes some addressing modes available that do not exist for regular ROR:
; C is shifted into the MSB
RRA abs, y
; like ROR abs, y
RRA (zp), y
; like ROR (zp), y
RRA (zp, x)
; like ROR (zp, x)
; A was changed as with additional ADC
; N,V,Z,C were set as with additional ADC
