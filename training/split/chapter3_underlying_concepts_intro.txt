# Contents - Introduction to underlying concepts required for the book: terms and names, 6510 programming model, and the hexadecimal numbering system; prepares reader for low-level hardware descriptions.

Chapter 3 
Underlying Concepts 



At this point, some of the essentials that you need 
to know in order to understand the rest of this book 
will be presented. The terms and names that will 
be used will be defined. The hardware of the Com- 
modore 64, and in particular, a programming model 
of the 6510 microprocessor will be discussed. Also, 
the hexadecimal numbering system (base 16), which 
is used throughout this book, will be described. This 
numbering system makes the most sense when 
dealing with computers. Since an understanding of 
the hexadecimal numbering system and its relation- 
ship to bits and bytes will make the hardware 
descriptions easier to understand, it will be 
presented first.
