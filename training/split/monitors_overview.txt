# MACHINE - Explains the concept of monitors vs. operating system/BASIC monitors: monitors are programs for direct machine-language interaction. Notes that PET/CBM has a built-in MLM, VIC-20 and C64 typically require an added monitor (cartridge or RAM load), and PLUS/4 has a powerful built-in MLM. Gives common entry commands (SYS 4, SYS 8, or MONITOR) depending on machine.

Monitors:  What They Are
------------------------

All computers have a built-in set of programs called an operating system that
gives the machine its style and basic capabilities.  The operating system
takes care of communications--reading the keyboard, making the proper things
appear on the screen, and translating data between the computer and other
devices, such as a disk, tape, or printer.

When we type on the computer keyboard, we use the operating system, which
detects the characters we type.  But there's an extra set of programs built
into the computer that must decide what we mean.  When we are using the BASIC
language, we'll be communicating with the BASIC monitor, which understands
BASIC commands such as NEW, LOAD, LIST, or RUN.  It contains editing features
that allow us to change the BASIC program that we are writing.

But when we switch to another system--often another language--we'll need to
use a different monitor.  Commands such as NEW or LIST don't have any meaning
for a machine language program.  We must leave the BASIC monitor and enter a
new environment:  the machine language monitor.  We'll need to learn some new
commands because we will be communicating with the computer in a different
way.
