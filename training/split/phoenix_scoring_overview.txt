# Contents - Scoring overview for 'Return of the Phoenix': players and phoenix compete for high score. Phoenix brick values decrease every four seconds (range 5 to 98 points depending on delay). Other scoring items are described in the game's scoring table. Two-player mode uses a shared player score (upper left) and a separate phoenix score (upper right); if players' score beats phoenix, the bridge flashes and falls; otherwise phoenix wins.

Scoring 

In this game, you are competing against the 
phoenix for the high score. The phoenix are con- 
trolled by the computer, and they have a different 
method of scoring then do the wizards. The number 
of points that the phoenix gets depends on how long 
you can prevent them from getting energy bricks 
to the bridge. After every four seconds, the value 
of the bricks to the phoenix decreases. The bricks 
can be worth from 5 to 98 points depending on how 
long you can keep the phoenix from getting a brick 
to the bridge. All of the rest of the scoring is more

standard and shown in Table 10-1. 

When the two player mode is selected, both 
players are working for one score. The players' score 
is in the upper left corner of the screen. Unlike most 
video games, in which the two players are com- 
peting, both players are working together for a com- 
mon goal. The phoenix score is in the upper right 



corner of the screen. This is just as valid a score 
as the players' score, in that they are working toward 
their own objectives. If the wizards beat the phoenix 
score, the bridge will flash and fall down at the end 
of the game. Similarly, if the phoenix beat the 
wizards score, they will display their message at the 
end of the game.
