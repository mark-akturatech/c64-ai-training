# COMMODORE 64 - Explains MOB enable control (MnE bits in register 21 ($15)) and behavior when disabled. Describes MOB positioning using X and Y position registers with a resolution of 512 horizontal × 256 vertical positions, the reference corner (upper-left of the array), and the visible coordinate ranges (X: 23–347 / $17–$157; Y: 50–249 / $32–$F9). Notes smooth on/off-screen movement.

  ENABLE

    Each MOB can be selectively enabled for display by setting its corre-
  sponding enable bit (MnE) to "1" in register 21 ($15). If the MnE bit is
  "0," no MOB operations will occur involving the disabled MOB.

  POSlTlON

    Each MOB is positioned via its X and Y position register (see register
  map) with a resolution of 512 horizontal and 256 vertical positions. The

  position of a MOB is determined by the upper-left corner of the array. X
  locations 23 to 347 ($17-$157) and Y locations 50 to 249 ($32-$F9) are
  visible. Since not all available MOB positions are entirely visible on
  the screen, MOBs may be moved smoothly on and off the display screen.
