# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - VIC-II (graphics chip) overview: quirky features and bugs that enable unique effects; timing-sensitive register writes (e.g. $d020 and $d021) required for raster effects.

The VIC
The VIC (the graphics chip) is very nice. The VIC has a lot of interesting bugs (or features, depending on how you look at it), which means you can create amazing effects that are unique to the C-64. It's all about learning about the hardware and learning how to use it to fit your needs, not just blindly following a specification document.

Most of these effects are achieved through well-timed modifications of VIC registers. That's one of the things are most important in demo program: to use perfectly timed code. Creating raster bars on the Amiga is easy: just put some values in the copper list. On the C-64, on the other hand, you have to change $d020 and/or $d021 at exactly the right time, or you'll get flickering bars.
