# MACHINE - Overview of 650x addressing modes: implied/accumulator (no address), immediate (value in instruction), absolute/zero-page (single memory address), absolute,x/y and zero-page,x/y indexing (range of 256), indirect (address stored at memory), relative (branch offsets), and combined indirect/indexed and indexed,indirect for flexible data access.

Addressing Modes
----------------

Computer instructions come in two parts:  the instruction itself, or op code,
and the address, or operand.  The term "address" is a little misleading,
since sometimes the operand does not refer to any memory address.

The term address mode refers to the way in which the instruction obtains
information.  Depending on how you count them, there are up to 13 address
modes used by the 650x microprocessor.  They may be summarized as follows:

  1.  No memory address:  implied, accumulator.

  2.  No address, but a value supplied:  immediate.

  3.  An address designating a single memory location:  absolute, zero-page.

  4.  An indexed address designating a range of 256 locations:  absolute,x;
      absolute,y;  zero-page,x;  zero-page,y.

  5.  A location in which the real (two-byte) jump address may be found:
      indirect.

  6.  An offset value (e.g., forward 9, back 17) used for branch
      instructions:  relative.

  7.  Combination of indirect and indexed addresses, useful for reaching data
      anywhere in memory:  indirect, indexed; indexed, indirect.
