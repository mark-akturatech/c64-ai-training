# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - How VIC-II maps Character ROM into VIC address space: VIC-II can address only 16K; character ROM is made visible to VIC-II as images at $1000-$1FFF and $9000-$9FFF so character data is accessible in those ranges. To use characters in other banks, copy ROM data into RAM (sample ML routine provided at $DD00). Notes that VIC-II reads RAM underneath ROM if RAM is present under ROM (useful under BASIC ROM).

                          If you have read about the VIC-II video chip, you know that it can
                          address only 16K of memory at a time, and that all display data such
                          as screen memory, character shape data, and sprite shape data must be
                          stored within that 16K block.

                          Since it would be very inconvenient for the VIC-II chip to be able to
                          access the character data only at the 16K block which includes
                          addresses 53248-57343 ($D000-$DFFF), the 64 uses an addressing trick
                          that makes the VIC-II chip see an image of the Character ROM at
                          4096-8191 ($1000-$1FFF) and at 36864-40959 ($9000-$9FFF).  It is not
                          available in the other two blocks.  To generate characters in these
                          blocks, you must supply your own user-defined character set, or copy
                          the ROM data to RAM.  A machine language routine for doing this is
                          included in a sample program at the entry for 56576 ($DD00).
