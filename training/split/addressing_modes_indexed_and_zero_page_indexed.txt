# 6502 Microprocessor - Indexed and Zero-page indexed addressing: base address is added to X or Y to produce effective address. Zero-page indexing wraps around within the zero page (8-bit wrap). Many zero-page indexed instructions use X only.

  6 & 7) Indexed and Zero-page Indexed
  In these modes the address given is added to the value in either the X or
  Y index register to give the actual address of the operand.
  eg.  LDA $31F6, Y
       $D9 $31F6
       LDA $31F6, X
       $DD $31F6
  Note that the different operation codes determine the index register used.
  In the zero-page version, you should note that the X and Y registers are
  not interchangeable. Most instructions which can be used with zero-page
  indexing do so with X only.
  eg.  LDA $20, X
       $B5 $20

- "addressing_modes_post_indexed_indirect" which expands on post-indexed indirect uses Y for adding after indirection
