# Contents - Advises evaluating assembler speed (assembly time limited by disk I/O) and stresses verifying that assembler-generated printouts include the information you need; introduces a list of common printout features that vary between assemblers.

Another aspect to examine while you are choos- 
ing an assembler is the speed with which it can 
assemble your source code and generate the 
necessary files on disk. Unfortunately, you can't ex- 
pect the assembler to work faster than the disk can 
move the data. 

You also should be sure that any printouts 
generated by the assembler contain all of the infor- 
mation that you would like. The following are some 
of the items that differ between assemblers:
