# ********* - Reserved I/O Expansion area (56832-57087 $DE00-$DEFF) accessible via Expansion Port pin 7 used by cartridges (examples: CP/M module, Simon's BASIC). Notes an alternate character generator ROM (53248-57343 $D000-$DFFF) description: ROM holds 4096 bytes = two complete 256-character sets (8 bytes/character), representing shape bitmaps (8x8), and how bytes map to pixel columns via bit positions (bit weights 1..128).

Location Range: 56832-57087 ($DE00-$DEFF)
Reserved for I/O Expansion

This range of locations is not used directly by the 64's internal
hardware.  It is, however, accessible via pin 7 of the Expansion Port.
It can be used to control cartridges which are connected to this port.
For example, the CP/M module uses this space to control which
microprocessor is in control of the system.  The Z-80 microprocessor
is turned on and off by writing to 56832 ($DE00).

Another cartridge which uses this space is Simon's BASIC.  This 16K
cartridge is addressed at memory locations 32768-49151 ($8000-$BFFF),
which means that it overlaps the regular BASIC ROM at 40960-49151
($A000-$BFFF).  But since it contains additions to BASIC, it must use
the BASIC ROM as well.  This problem is solved by copying the
cartridge at 32768-40959 ($8000-$9FFF) to RAM, and turning the
cartridge on and off by writing to or reading from location 56832
($DE00).

This range of locations is not used directly by the 64's internal
hardward, but is accessible via pin 10 of the Expansion Port.  One
possible use for this I/O memory that Commodore has mentioned is an
inexpensive parallel disk drive (which presumable would be much faster
than the current serial model).

Character Generator ROM

The character generator ROM supplies the data which is to form the
shapes of the text and graphics characters that are displayed on the
screen.  Each character requires eight bytes of shape data, and these
eight-byte sequences are arranged in order in which the characters
appear in the screen code chart (see Appendix G).  For example, the
first eight bytes of data in the ROM hold the shape information for
the commercial at sign (@), the next eight hold the shape of the
letter A, etc.  In all, there are 4096 bytes, representing shape data
for two complete character sets of 256 characters each--1K each for
uppercase/graphics, reverse uppercase/reverse graphics, lowercase/
uppercase, and reverse lowercase/reverse uppercase.

The shape of each character is formed by an 8 by 8 matrix of screen
dots.  Whether any of the 64 dots is lit up or not is determined by
the bit patterns of the character data.  Each byte of the Character
ROM holds a number from 0 to 255.  This number can be represented by
eight binary digits of 0 or 1.  The leftmost bit of these eight is
known as Bit 7, while the rightmost bit is called Bit 0.  Each of
these binary digits has a bit value that is two times greater than the
last.  The values of a bit set to 1 in each of the bit places are:

Bit    0    1     2    3    4    5    6    7
Value  1    2     4    8   16   32   64  128

A byte whose value is 255 has every bit set to 1
