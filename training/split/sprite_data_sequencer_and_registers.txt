# The MOS 6567/6569 video controller (VIC-II) and its application in the Commodore 64 - Describes internal sprite hardware: each sprite has a 24-bit shift register (core of the data sequencer), a 6-bit MC (MOB Data Counter) that is loaded from MCBASE, a 6-bit MCBASE (MOB Data Counter Base) with reset input, and an expansion flip-flop per sprite that controls Y expansion.

Every sprite has its own sprite data sequencer whose core is a 24 bit shift
register. Apart from that, there are two internal registers for every
sprite:

 � "MC" (MOB Data Counter) is a 6 bit counter that can be loaded from
   MCBASE.
 � "MCBASE" (MOB Data Counter Base) is a 6 bit counter with reset input.

Besides, there is one expansion flip flop per sprite that controls the
Y expansion.
