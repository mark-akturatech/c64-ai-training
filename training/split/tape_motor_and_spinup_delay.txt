# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Enable cassette motor and perform long spin-up delay: read 6510 I/O port, mask and set the cassette motor bit, store motor interlock ($C0), then perform a nested delay loop (LDX/LDY with two nested decrement loops) to provide a large motor spin-up delay (counting to create ~326,656 cycles) before starting timed tape operations.

.,F8AB A5 01    LDA $01         read the 6510 I/O port
.,F8AD 29 1F    AND #$1F        mask 000x xxxx, cassette motor on ??
.,F8AF 85 01    STA $01         save the 6510 I/O port
.,F8B1 85 C0    STA $C0         set the tape motor interlock
                                326656 cycle delay, allow tape motor speed to stabilise
