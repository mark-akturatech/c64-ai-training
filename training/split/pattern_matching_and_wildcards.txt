# ********* - Section 3.4: Pattern matching on disk with '*' to match any trailing characters and '?' as a single-character wildcard; syntax examples for LOAD and directory filtering (e.g., LOAD "$0:T*", LOAD "$0:T?ST*"), and behavior of using just '*' to load the last-accessed program.



3.4 PATTERN MATCHING AND WILD CARDS

When using the tape deck, you can LOAD any program starting with
certain letters just by leaving off any following letters.  Thus, the
command LOAD "T" will find the first program on the tape beginning
with the letter T. And LOAD "HELLO" will find the first program
beginning with the letters HELLO, like "HELLO THERE."

When using the disk, this option is called pattern matching, and there
is a special character in the file name used to designate this.  The
asterisk (*) character following any program name tells the drive you
want to find any program starting with that name.

FORMAT FOR PATTERN MATCHING:
			      +-------------------+
 LOAD name$ + "*", 8          | Can Be a String   |
	 |                    | Variable Or The   |
	 +--------------------+ Name Inside Quotes|
			      +-------------------+

In other words, if you want to LOAD the first program on the disk
starting with the letter T, use the command LOAD "T*", 8.

If only the "*" is used for the name, the last program accessed on the
disk is the one LOADed.  If no program has yet been LOADed, the first
one listed in the directory is the one used.

You are probably familiar with the concept of wild cards in poker
where one card can replace any other card needed.  On your 1541, the
question mark (?) can be used as a wild card on the disk.  The program
name on the disk is compared to the name in the LOAD command, but any
characters where there is a question mark in the name aren't checked.

For instance, when the command LOAD "T?NT", 8 is given, programs that
match include TINT, TENT, etc.

When LOADing the directory of the disk, pattern matching and wild
cards can be used to check for a list of specific programs.  If you
gave the command LOAD "$0:TEST", only the program TEST would appear in
the directory (if present on the disk).  The command LOAD "$0:T*"
would give you a directory of all programs beginning with the letter T.
And LOAD "$0:T?ST" would give you all the programs with 4-letter names
having the first letter of T and the third and fourth letters ST. LOAD
"$0:T?ST*" would give names of any length with the correct first,
third, and fourth letters.
