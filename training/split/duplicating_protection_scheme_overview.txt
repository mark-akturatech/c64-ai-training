# byRiclianll - 7.5 Duplicating a Protection Scheme: rank order of errors commonly used on copy-protected diskettes (1: 21 full track, 2: 23 single sector, 3: 23 full track, 4: 20 single sector, 5: 27 full track, 6: 29 multiple formatting, 7: 22 single sector, 8: 21 partial track). Historical notes and statement that 21 full-track and 23 single-sector are predominant and easiest to duplicate. Lists 13 supplied programs to create or duplicate specific error types (DESTROY A SECTOR, FULL TRACK 21, 23A/23B/23M, 20/20M, 27M, 22A/22B, FORMAT A DISKETTE 29, BACKUP, COPY), and notes '*' means exact duplicate of a bad sector. Mentions that source listings for machine-code routines are included; BASIC drivers are simple and assumed known.


7.5  Duplicating  a  Protection  Scheme 

The  following  table  represents  the  state  of  the  error.  The  rank  order  in  which  errors 
tend  to  crop  up  on  copy  protected  diskettes  are  as  follows: 

1.  21  ERROR  (FULL  TRACK) 

2.  23  ERROR  (SINGLE  SECTOR) 

3.  23  ERROR  (FULL  TRACK) 

4.  20  ERROR  (SINGLE  SECTOR) 

5.  27  ERROR  (FULL  TRACK) 

6.  29  ERROR  (MULTIPLE  FORMATTING) 

7.  22  ERROR  (SINGLE  SECTOR) 

8.  21  ERROR  (PARTIAL  TRACK) 

Historically  speaking,  the  21  error  (full  track)  and  the  29  error  appeared  on  the  scene 
concurrently.  At  the  present  time,  a  full  track  21  error  and  a  single  sector  23  error  are 
the  predominant  errors  used  to  corrupt  a  diskette.  These  same  two  errors  are  also  the 
easiest  to  duplicate.  The  last  entry,  partial  formatting  of  a  track,  is  the  new  kid  on  the 
block.

The  following  13  programs  can  be  used  to  duplicate  a  multitude  of  errors  on  a  diskette. 
They  are:

Source  listings  for  the  machine  language  routines  in  these  programs  are  included  as 
a  courtesy  to  the  more  advanced  reader.  The  BASIC  drivers  themselves  are  nondescript 
and  vfiW  not  be  explained  in  depth.  It  is  assummed  that  the  reader  has  digested  the 
sections  on  beginning  and  intermediate  direct-access  programming  in  Chapters  5  and 
6.  Algorithms  vfiW  be  briefly  mentioned  along  with  any  new  techniques  and/or  limita- 
tions that  apply.
