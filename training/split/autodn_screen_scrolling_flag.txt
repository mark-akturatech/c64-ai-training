# ********* - AUTODN (location 658, $292): flag controlling screen autoscroll when cursor moves past 40th column of a logical line. 0 enables scrolling down to add a physical line; nonzero disables it. The OS temporarily disables scrolling if there are characters pending in keyboard buffer.

658           $292           AUTODN
Flag: Screen Scrolling Enabled

This location is used to determine whether moving the cursor past the
fortieth column of a logical line will cause another physical line to
be added to the logical line.

A value of 0 enables the screen to scroll the following lines down in
order to add that line; any nonzero value will disable the scroll.
This flag is set to disable the scroll temporarily when there are
characters waiting in the keyboard buffer (these may include cursor
movement characters that would eliminate the need for a scroll).
