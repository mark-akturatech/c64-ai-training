# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - I/O expansion area ($DE00-$DEFF): reserved for cartridges and expansion hardware via Expansion Port pin 7. Examples: CP/M module uses 56832 ($DE00) to switch Z-80 CPU control; Simon's BASIC cartridge uses this space for on/off control of cartridge features when overlaying ROM at $8000-$BFFF by writing/reading $DE00.

$DE00-$DEFF               Reserved for I/O Expansion

                          This range of locations is not used directly by the 64's internal
                          hardware.  It is, however, accessible via pin 7 of the Expansion Port.
                          It can be used to control cartridges which are connected to this port.
                          For example, the CP/M module uses this space to control which
                          microprocessor is in control of the system.  The Z-80 microprocessor
                          is turned on and off by writing to 56832 ($DE00).

                          Another cartridge which uses this space is Simon's BASIC.  This 16K
                          cartridge is addressed at memory locations 32768-49151 ($8000-$BFFF),
                          which means that it overlaps the regular BASIC ROM at 40960-49151
                          ($A000-$BFFF).  But since it contains additions to BASIC, it must use
                          the BASIC ROM as well.  This problem is solved by copying the
                          cartridge at 32768-40959 ($8000-$9FFF) to RAM, and turning the
                          cartridge on and off by writing to or reading from location 56832
                          ($DE00).
