# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Video Matrix Base Address and Character Dot-Data Base within VIC-II memory controlled by Memory Control Register ($D018 / 53272). Notes on Character Generator ROM and how displayed character shapes use an 8x8 dot matrix. Border ($D020 / 53280) and Background Color Register 0 ($D021 / 53281) mention.


                          The most familiar type of graphics display is the ordinary text that
                          appears when you turn the machine on.  The area of RAM which is
                          displayed on the screen is determined by the Video Matrix Base Address
                          Nybble of the VIC-II Memory Control Register (53272, $D018).  The
                          address of the dot-data which is used to assign a shape to each text
                          character based on an 8 by 8 matrix of lit or unlit dots is determined
                          by the other half of the Memory Control Register at 53272 ($D018).
                          More information on how the data is used to represent the character
                          shapes may be found at the alternate entry for 49152 ($C000), the
                          Character Generator ROM.

                          Text character graphics may employ one of the two sets of text and
                          graphics characters in the Character Generator ROM, or the user may
                          substitute a completely different set of graphics or text characters
                          in RAM.

                          Normally, the text graphics screen uses a background color which is
                          common to all text characters, and that value is stored in Background
                          Color Register 0 (53281, $D021).  The color of the frame around the
                          screen is determined by the Border Color Register at 53280 ($D020).
