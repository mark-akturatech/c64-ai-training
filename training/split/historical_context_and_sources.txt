# A 256 Byte Autostart Fast Loader for the Commodore 64 - Context and significance: individual fast-loader techniques (fast protocols, drive code uploading, screen-off optimization) pre-existed; novelty here is combining them into a single-sector (256-byte) implementation. Includes pointer to full source at https://github.com/mist64/fastboot1541.



Historical Context
------------------

Individual techniques - fast protocols, drive code uploading, screen-off
optimization - had existed previously in various fast loaders. What's
really novel was combining these techniques into a single-sector
implementation, demonstrating the possibility of fitting substantial
functionality into severe size constraints.
