# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Overview of CIA #2 Data Direction Registers ($DD02-$DD03): control direction of Data Ports A and B respectively. Default settings: DDRA default 63 (all bits except 6,7 outputs), DDRB default 0 (all inputs). RS-232 open operation changes PB1 and PB2 to outputs. Refer to CIA #1 DDR entry for operational details.

$DD02-$DD03               CIA #2 Data Direction Registers A and B

                          These Data Direction registers control the direction of data flow over
                          Data Ports A and B.  For more details on the operation of these
                          registers, see the entry for the CIA #1 Data Direction Registers at
                          56322 ($DC02).

                          The default setting for Data Direction Register A is 63 (all bits
                          except 6 and 7 are outputs), and for Data Direction Register B the
                          default setting is 0 (all inputs).  Bits 1 and 2 of Port B are changed
                          to output when the RS-232 device is opened.
