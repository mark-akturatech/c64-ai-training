# ********* - How CIA #1 timers are used on the C64: Timer A generates the IRQ used for keyboard scanning and software clock updates; both timers are used for tape timing. Typical Timer A latch for IRQ is low=149, high=66 (total 17045) for ~1/60 second intervals (NTSC). Tape routines take over IRQ vectors for tape I/O and use CIA #1 Timers A and B for timing.

In the 64, CIA #1 Timer A is used to generate the interrupt which
drives the routine for reading the keyboard and updating the software
clock.  Both Timers A and B are also used for the timing of the
routines that read and write tape data.  Normally, Timer A is set for
continuous operation, and latched with a value of 149 in the low byte
and 66 in the high byte, for a total Latch Value of 17045.  This means
that it is set to count to 0 every 17045/1022730 seconds, or
approximately 1/60 second.

For tape reads and writes, the tape routines take over the IRQ
vectors.  Even though the tape write routines use the on-chip I/O port
at location 1 for the actual data output to the cassette, reading and
writing to the cassette uses both CIA #1 Timer A and Timer B for
timing the I/O routines.
