# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Why the C-64 being old and slow is an advantage: forces efficient algorithms and clever programming rather than brute-force CPU usage.

It's Old and Slow
That the C-64 is old and slow might not sound like much of an advantage, but when it comes to demo programming, it is. Why? It means that it's difficult to do stuff that requires lots of computations. You can't just throw CPU cycles at it, and write inefficient code. You have to think, to make it efficient. And doing really difficult things is what demo programming is all about. A good programmer can write a program that does something that seems very hard to do. A good demo programmer can write code that does something that is considered completely impossible.

There used to be a conservative rant here about how real demos are written in assembler and stuff like that, but most demos these days are written in high level languages and co-exist with an operating system, which means no direct hardware access etc. Demos for more powerful platforms are more about design than code these days anyway. But this isn't the right place to rant about that, so I removed it.
