# COMMODORE 64 - KERNAL RESTOR (call $FF8A / 65418): restore default system and interrupt vectors in RAM used by KERNAL and BASIC. No preparatory routines required. Use KERNAL VECTOR to read/alter individual vectors before restoring. Example: JSR RESTOR.

  B-23. Function Name: RESTOR

    Purpose: Restore default system and interrupt vectors
    Call address: $FF8A (hex) 65418 (decimal)
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns: None
    Stack requirements: 2
    Registers affected: A, X, Y

    Description: This routine restores the default values of all system
  vectors used in KERNAL and BASIC routines and interrupts. (See the Memory
  Map for the default vector contents). The KERNAL VECTOR routine is used
  to read and alter individual system vectors.

  How to Use:
    1) Call this routine.

  EXAMPLE:
    JSR RESTOR
