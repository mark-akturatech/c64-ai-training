# byRiclianll - Introductory note that the VIC-series User's Manual outlines seven USER commands that jump to locations in RAM and mentions their jump addresses (list omitted here), a comment that these jump locations are simpler than they appear, and the start of a modified memory-execute example (REM U3 and the beginning OPEN 15,8,15) to demonstrate USER commands.



The  VlC-lSJtl  User's  Manual  outlines  7  USER  commands  that  perform  a  jump  to  a 
particular  location  in  RAM.  These  USER  commands  and  their  respective  jump  addresses 
are: 


These  jump  locations  are  not  quite  as  mystifying  as  they  appear  at  first  glance.  Let's 
modify  our  simplistic  memory-execute  program. 

100  REM  U3 

1 10  OPEN   15, 8, 15
