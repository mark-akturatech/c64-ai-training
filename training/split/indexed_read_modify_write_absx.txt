# NMOS 6510 - Indexed Read-Modify-Write behaviour for Absolute X Indexed forms: ASL/DEC/INC/LSR/ROL/ROR/DCP/ISC etc on abs,X. Shows the per-cycle sequence including dummy fetch from target address before high byte corrected on page-cross, the unmodified data write-back, and the final write of modified data. Notes dummy fetch and unmodified write-back semantics.
