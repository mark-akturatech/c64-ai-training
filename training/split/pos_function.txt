  POS

  TYPE: Integer Function
  FORMAT: POS (<dummy>)

    Action: Tells you the current cursor position which, of course, is in
  the range of 0 (leftmost character) though position 79 on an 80-character
  logical screen line. Since the Commodore 64 has a 40-column screen, any
  position from 40 through 79 will refer to the second screen line. The
  dummy argument is ignored.

  EXAMPLE of POS Function:

    1000 IF POS(0)>38 THEN PRINT CHR$(13)
