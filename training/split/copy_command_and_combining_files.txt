4.3 COPY

This command allows you to make a copy of any program or file on the
disk drive.  It won't copy from one drive to a different one (except
in the case of dual drives like the 4040), but it can duplicate a
program under another name on the drive.

FORMAT FOR THE COPY COMMAND:

   PRINT# 15, "COPY:newfile=oldfile"

or abbreviated as

   PRINT# 15, "C:newfile=oldfile"

The COPY command can also be used to combine two through four files on
the disk.

FORMAT FOR COPY TO COMBINE FILES:

 PRINT# 15, "C:newfile=oldfile1,oldfile2,oldfile3,oldfile4"

EXAMPLES OF COPY COMMAND:

   PRINT# 15, "C:BACKUP=ORIGINAL"
   PRINT# 15, "C:MASTERFILE=NAME,ADDRESS,PHONES"
