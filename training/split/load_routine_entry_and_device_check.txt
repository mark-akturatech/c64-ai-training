# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Start of the LOAD implementation: saves the load/verify flag, clears the serial status byte, fetches the device number ($BA) and rejects the keyboard (device #$03) as an illegal device for LOAD (branches to the 'illegal device number' error). Continues beyond to dispatch device-specific LOAD behavior.

                                *** load
.,F4A5 85 93    STA $93         save load/verify flag
.,F4A7 A9 00    LDA #$00        clear A
.,F4A9 85 90    STA $90         clear the serial status byte
.,F4AB A5 BA    LDA $BA         get the device number
.,F4AD D0 03    BNE $F4B2       if not the keyboard continue
                                do 'illegal device number'
.,F4AF 4C 13 F7 JMP $F713       else do 'illegal device number' and return
.,F4B2 C9 03    CMP #$03
