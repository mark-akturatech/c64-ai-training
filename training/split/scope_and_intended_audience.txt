# NMOS 6510 - Scope: targets MOS6510 (Commodore 64/128 related CPUs) and notes compatibility with various 6502 second sources; exclusions (65C02, 65816, etc.); Intended audience: assumes familiarity with 6502 assembly and CPU flags.

meaning they used the same masks for manufacturing, so their chips should behave (exactly) the
same. The 6502C “SALLY” found in Atari 8-bit computers also seems to work the same.
Some of the 'unstable' opcodes are known to work slightly different on 6502 equipped machines,
but that is just the result of the RDY line not being used in them.
This document does not apply to the 65C02, 652SC02, 65CE02, 65816 etc. (These are all not 100%
6502 compatible)
The 6507 used in the Atari 2600 VCS appears to work the same with some limitations: the address
bus is limited to 13 bits - the top three bits are not available on the chip package. Also missing on
the chip package are the IRQ and NMI lines, which are hard wired to "+5V" internally.
Whether related CPUs like the 7501/8501 used in the CBM264 series behaves the same has not
been tested (but is likely – feedback welcomed).

Intended Audience
This document is not for beginners (such as yourself) *. The reader should be familiar with 6502
assembly, and in particular is expected to know how the regular opcodes and CPU flags work
exactly. For those that do not feel confident enough, having a reference to the regular opcodes, flags
behaviour and things like decimal mode at hand is probably highly recommended.
