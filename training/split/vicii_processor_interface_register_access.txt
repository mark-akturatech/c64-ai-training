# COMMODORE 64 - Processor interface and register access rules: lists processor-facing signals and behavior for register access. Covers DATA BUS (DB7-DB0) as bidirectional and only accessible while AEC and Phase 0 are high and /CS is low; CHIP SELECT (/CS) which is recognized only while AEC and Phase 0 are high; READ/WRITE (R/W) direction semantics; ADDRESS BUS (A5-A0) as bidirectional low-order address pins used to select registers during processor reads/writes. Includes surrounding pagination and spacing from the original document.

  PROCESSOR INTERFACE

    Aside from the special memory accesses described above, the 6566/6567
  registers can be accessed similar to any other peripheral device. The
  following processor interface signals are provided:

  DATA BUS (DB7-DB0)

    The eight data bus pins are the bidirectional data port, controlled by
  /CS, RW, and Phase 0. The data bus can only be accessed while AEC and
  Phase 0 are high and /CS is low.

  CHIP SELECT (/CS)

    The chip select pin, /CS, is brought low to enable access to the device
  registers in conjunction with the address and RW pins. /CS low is recog-
  nized only while AEC and Phase 0 are high.

  READ/WRITE (R/W)

    The read/write input, R/W, is used to determine the direction of data
  transfer on the data bus, in conjunction with /CS. When R/W is high ("1")
  data is transferred from the selected register to the data bus output.
  When R/W is low ("0") data presented on the data bus pins is loaded into
  the selected register.

  ADDRESS BUS (A05-A00)

    The lower six address pins, A5-A0, are bidirectional. During a pro-
  cessor read or write of the video device, these address pins are inputs.
  The data on the address inputs selects the register for read or write as
  defined in the register map.
