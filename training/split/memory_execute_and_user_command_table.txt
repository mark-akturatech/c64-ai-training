# ********* - Section 8.4–8.5: MEMORY-EXECUTE syntax (PRINT#file#,"M-E" CHR$(low) CHR$(high)) to run code in DOS memory; USER command table (U1..U9, U; etc.) mapping USERn to jump vectors/addresses in disk RAM and examples of sending USER commands (PRINT# 15,"U3" or concatenated USER strings), description of UI+/UI- for speed switching.




8.4 MEMORY-EXECUTE

Any routine in the DOS memory, RAM or ROM, can be executed with the
MEMORY-EXECUTE command.

FORMAT FOR MEMORY-EXECUTE:

    PRINT#file#, "M-E" CHR$(low address byte) CHR$(high byte)

See line 30 above for an example.

8.5 USER COMMANDS

Aside from the USER1 and USER2 commands discussed in chapter 6, and
the UI+ and UI- commands in chapter 2, the USER commands are jumps to
a table of locations in the disk drive's RAM memory.

USER COMMAND                    FUNCTION

 U1 or UA      BLOCK-READ without changing buffer-pointer
 U2 or UB      BLOCK-WRITE without changing buffer-pointer
 U3 or UC      jump to $0500  --+
 U4 or UD      jump to $0503    |
 U5 or UE      jump to $0506    |
 U6 or UF      jump to $0509    + (HEXADECIMAL LOCATIONS)
 U7 or UG      jump to $050C    |
 U8 or UH      jump to $05OF    |
 U9 or UI      jump to $FFFA  --+
 U; or UJ      power-up vector
 UI+           set Commodore 64 speed
 UI-           set VIC 20 speed

By loading these locations with another jump command, like JMP $0520,
you can create longer routines that operate in the disk's memory along
with an easy-to-use jump table -- even from BASIC!

EXAMPLES OF USER COMMANDS:

     PRINT# 15, "U3"
     PRINT# 15, "U"+CHR$(50+Q)
     PRINT# 15, "UI"
