# Contents - Sprite multipliers: sprites can be expanded (doubled) in X or Y direction (pixel size doubles, resolution unchanged). X expansion controlled by SPRXSZ ($D01D) bits; Y expansion by SPRYSZ ($D017) bits. Set bit to expand, clear to return to normal. Both can be set for X and Y expansion simultaneously.




Using the sprite multipliers. Each of the 
sprites can be expanded in either the X or Y direc- 
tion. When a sprite is expanded, each pixel is 
displayed as twice the normal size in the direction 
of the expansion. The resolution of the sprite does 
not increase, only the size. 

To expand a sprite in the X direction, the ap- 
propriate bit must be set in the SPRXSZ ($D01D ) 
register. To return the sprite to its normal size, clear 
and bit. 

The expansion of a sprite in the Y direction is 
done in the same way as the X expansion. You must 
set the appropriate bit in the SPRYSZ ($D017) 
register to expand the sprite. The sprite can be 
returned to its normal size by clearing its bit in the 
SPRYSZ register. The sprite can also be expanded 
in both the X and Y directions by setting its bit in 
both registers.
