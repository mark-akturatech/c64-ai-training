# byRiclianll - Tail-end hex and ASCII dumps of the file's final blocks, labeled . 00:, . 08:, . 10:, and . 18:. Shows byte values and ASCII fragments for the file's last sectors, illustrating the actual bytes (including the three terminating $00 bytes referenced in the EOF explanation) and the final layout of the block data.
