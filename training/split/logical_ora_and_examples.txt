# MACHINE - Detailed explanation of the ORA instruction applied to A, with a truth table showing how ORA masks can turn bits on. Example showing how to turn on bits 4,5,6 of $C7 using ORA #$70 (mask 01110000b) and the resulting value.

ORA--Logical OR to A
--------------------

For each bit in the A register, ORA performs the following action:


Original A Bit    Mask     Resulting A Bit
------------------------------------------
      0            0             0
      1            0             1
      0            1             1
      1            1             1


Examine the upper half of this table.  When the mask is zero, the original
bit in A is left unchanged.  Examine the lower half.  When the mask is one,
the original bit is forced to "on."  Hence, ORA can selectively turn bits on.

Example:  Turn on bits 4, 5, and 6 in the following value:  $C7

  Original value:      11000111
  Mask:            ORA 01110000 (hex 70)
                   ------------
  Result:              11110111
                        ^^^

Note that the bits marked have been forced to "on," while all the other bits
remain unchanged.
