# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Handles [INSERT]/[DELETE] control behavior: supports inserting reversed characters, tests for line-wrap/back-to-previous-line, shifts characters left to close up a deleted position across the line (moving both screen character bytes and colour RAM bytes), clears the last character on the line to SPACE and sets its colour, and returns appropriately.

                                character was < [SPACE] so is a control character
