# MACHINE - Using the monitor memory display (.M) to inspect object bytes placed in memory (example .:033C A9 48 20 D2 FF 00 xx xx) and explanation that bytes after BRK are irrelevant for program execution.

If you like, you can display memory and look at the object program with the
.M 033C 0341.  You'll see the bytes of your program in memory:

  .:033C A9 48 20 D2 FF 00 xx xx

                                                                         :29:

The first six bytes are your program.  The last two bytes don't matter:  they
were whatever was in that part of memory before.  We don't care what is
there, since the program will stop when it reaches the BRK ($00) at address
$0341; it won't be concerned with the contents of memory at $0342 or $0343.
