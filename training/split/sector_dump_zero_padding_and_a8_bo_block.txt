# byRiclianll - Lines cover the zero/padding region of the sector dump and the trailing special-value block. This section begins at the ':  OO' marker and contains many repeated '00' (rendered as 'OO') entries representing padding or unused bytes, a sequence including 'A8' and subsequent repeated '00' runs, and finishes with a final 'BO' entry. This chunk represents the sector body's common padding area and an A8/BO block that often indicates end-of-table or reserved data.
