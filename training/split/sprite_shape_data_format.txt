# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - How sprite shape bytes map to dots: bits in each byte represent dots (bit0=1, bit7=128), 24 dots per line use 3 bytes (24 bits). Explanation of binary weights and how combinations of bits give 0-255 values for bytes.

                          The dot patterns of each sprite correspond to the bit patterns of the
                          sprite shape data.  Each byte of shape data in memory consists of a
                          number from 0 to 255.  This number can be represented by eight binary
                          digits of 0 or 1.

                          Each binary digit has a bit value that is two times greater than the
                          last.  If the digit in the zero bit place is a 1, it has a value of 1
                          (we count bit places from 0 to 7).  A 1 in the first bit place has a
                          value of 2, the second bit has a value of 4, the third has a value of
                          8, the fourth has a value of 16, the fifth a value of 32, the sixth a
                          value of 64, and the seventh a value of 128.

                          By making all of the possible combinations of 0's and 1's in all eight
                          bit places, and adding the bit values of every bit place that contains
                          a 1, we can represent every number from 0 to 255 as a series of 1's
                          and 0's.

                          If you think of every 0 as a dot having the same color as the
                          background, and every 1 as a dot which is the color of the sprite, you
                          can see how a series of bytes could be used to represent the sprite
                          shape.
