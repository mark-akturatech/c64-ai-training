# ********* - BASIC initialization and start routines: Warm/Cool start entries (58235 $E37B warm start, 58260 $E394 cold start), INIT and INITAT (58303 $E3BF, 58274 $E3A2) copying CHRGET routine to page 0, initial RND seed value (59298 $E3BA) and INIT which initializes BASIC zero-page locations. Print BASIC startup messages routine (58402 $E422), vectors table and copying BASIC vectors to RAM (58439 $E447, 58451 $E453), and power-up messages stored at 58464 $E460.

58126         $E30E          ATN
Perform ATN

The arc tangent of the number in FAC1 (which represents the angle in
radians) is evaluated using the 12-term series of operations from the
constant table which follows.  The answer is left in FAC1.

58174         $E33E          ATNCON
Table of Constants for ATN Evaluation

The table begins with a count byte of 11, which is followed by 12
constants in five-byte floating point representation.

58235         $E37B
Warm Start BASIC

This is the entry point into BASIC from the BRK routine at 65126
($FE66), which is executed when the STOP and RESTORE keys are both
pressed.  It first executes the Kernal CLRCHN routine which closes all
files.  It then sets the default devices, resets the stack and BASIC
program pointers, and jumps through the vector at 768 ($300) to the
next routine to print the READY prompt and enter the main BASIC loop.

58251         $E38B
Error Message Handler

This routine to print error messages is pointed to by the vector at
768 ($300).  Using the .X register as an index, it either prints an
error message from the table at 41363 ($A193) or the READY prompt, and
continues through the vector at 770 ($302) to the main BASIC loop.

58260         $E394
Cold Start BASIC

This initialization routine is executed at the time of power-up.  The
RAM vectors to important BASIC routines are set up starting at 768
($300), the interpreter is initialized, the start-up messages are
printed, and the main loop entered through the end of the warm start
routine.

58274         $E3A2          INITAT
Text of the CHRGET Routine Which Runs at 115 ($73)

The text of the CHRGET routine is stored here, and moved to Page 0 by
the BASIC initialization routine.  When creating a wedge in CHRGET, it
is possible to execute all or part of this code in place of the RAM
version.

59298         $E3BA
Initial RND Seed Value

At power-up time, this five-byte floating point constant is
transferred to 139 ($8B), where it functions as the starting RND seed
number.  Thus, if RND is not initialized with a negative or zero
argument, it will always return the same sequence of numbers.

58303         $E3BF          INIT
Initialize BASIC

This routine is called by the cold start routine to initialize all of
the BASIC zero-page locations which have a fixed value.  This includes
copying the CHRGET routine from the ROM location above, to 115 ($73).

58402         $E422
Print BASIC Start-Up Messages

This routine prints the start-up message "**** COMMODORE 64 BASIC V2
****", calculates the amount of free memory, and prints the BYTES FREE
message.

58439         $E447
Table of Vectors to Important BASIC Routines

This table contains the vectors which point to the addresses of some
important BASIC routines.  The contents of this table are moved to the
RAM table at 768 ($300).

58451         $E453
Copy BASIC Vectors to RAM

The cold start routine calls this subroutine to copy the table of
vectors to important BASIC routines to RAM, starting at location 768
($300).
