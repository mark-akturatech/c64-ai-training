# Analyzing C64 tape loaders - Detailed hardware vectors mapping: $FFFA (Non-Maskable Interrupt Hardware Vector) points to ROM NMI routine; $FFFC (System Reset/RES vector) points to power-on routine $FCE2; $FFFE (Maskable IRQ/BRK vector) points to main IRQ handler $FF48. Explains their roles in handling RES/IRQ/NMI.

65530 $FFFA
Non-Maskable Interrupt Hardware Vector
</code>

This vector points to the main NMI routine at 65091 ($FE43).

<code>
65532 $FFFC
System Reset (RES) Hardware Vector
</code>

This vector points to the power-on routine at 64738 ($FCE2).

<code>
65534 $FFFE
Maskable Interrupt Request and Break Hardware Vectors
</code>

This vector points to the main IRQ handler routine at 65352 ($FF48).
