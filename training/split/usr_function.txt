# COMMODORE 64 - USR(numeric): calls user machine-language subroutine pointed to by two-byte address stored at memory locations 785-786. Caller must POKE the address into 785-786 first. The numeric argument is passed via floating-point accumulator area starting at location 97 for assembler access; when subroutine returns its result should be in the same accumulator area and USR returns that floating result. Example usage showing C=USR(B/2).

  USR

  TYPE: Floating-Point Function
  FORMAT: USR (<numeric>)

    Action: The USR function jumps to a User callable machine language
  SubRoutine which has its starting address pointed to by the contents of
  memory locations 785-786. The starting address is established before
  calling the USR function by using POKE statements to set up locations
  785-786. Unless POKE statements are used, locations 785-786 will give
  you an ?ILLEGAL QUANTITY error message.
    The value of the <numeric> argument is stored in the floating-point
  accumulator starting at location 97, for access by the Assembler code,
  and the result of the USR function is the value which ends up there when
  the subroutine returns to BASIC.

  EXAMPLES of USR Function:

    10 B=T*SIN(Y)
    20 C=USR(B/2)
    30 D=USR(B/3)
