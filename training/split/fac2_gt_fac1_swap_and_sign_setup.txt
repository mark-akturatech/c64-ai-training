# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Handle the case FAC2 > FAC1: save exponent into FAC1 exponent slot, fetch FAC2 sign bit and store as FAC1 sign, take two's complement of A (preparing sign/magnitude handling), clear Y, clear FAC2 rounding byte and set index to FAC1 exponent address (effectively swapping roles so the larger-magnitude operand is treated as the minuend).

                                else FAC2 > FAC1
.,B881 84 61    STY $61         save FAC1 exponent
.,B883 A4 6E    LDY $6E         get FAC2 sign (b7)
.,B885 84 66    STY $66         save FAC1 sign (b7)
.,B887 49 FF    EOR #$FF        complement A
.,B889 69 00    ADC #$00        +1, twos complement, carry is set
.,B88B A0 00    LDY #$00        clear Y
.,B88D 84 56    STY $56         clear FAC2 rounding byte
.,B88F A2 61    LDX #$61        set index to FAC1 exponent address
.,B891 D0 04    BNE $B897       branch always
