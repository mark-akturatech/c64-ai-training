    Widely read by educators, businessmen and students, as well as home
  computerists, COMMODORE Magazine is our main vehicle for sharing
  exclusive information on the more technical use of Commodore systems.
  Regular departments cover business, science and education, programming
  tips, "excerpts from a technical notebook," and many other features of
  interest to anyone who uses or is thinking about purchasing Commodore
  equipment for business, scientific or educational applications.
  COMMODORE is the ideal complement to POWER/PLAY. Published bimonthly.
  Subscription price: $15.00 per year.

  COMMODORE INFORMATION NETWORK

    The magazine of the future is here. To supplement and enhance your
  subscription to POWER/PLAY and COMMODORE magazines, the COMMODORE
  INFORMATION NETWORK - our "paperless magazine" - is available now over
  the telephone using your Commodore computer and modem.
    Join our computer club, get help with a computing problem, "talk" to
  other Commodore friends, or get up-to-the-minute information on new
  products, software and educational resources. Soon you will even be
  able to save yourself the trouble of typing in the program listings you
  find in POWER/PLAY or COMMODORE by downloading direct from the
  Information Network (a new user service planned for early 1983). The
  best part is that most of the answers are there before you even ask the
  questions. (How's that for service?)
    To call our electronic magazine you need only a modem and a sub-
  scription to CompuServe TM, one of the nation's largest telecommunica-
  tions networks. (To make it easy for you Commodore includes a FREE year's
  subscription to CompuServe TM in each VICMODEM package.) Just dial your
  local number for the CompuServe (TM) data bank and connect your phone to
  the modem. When the CompuServe (TM) video text appears on your screen
  type G CBM on your computer keyboard. When the COMMODORE INFORMATION
  NETWORK'S table of contents, or "menu," appears on your screen choose
  from one of our sixteen departments, make yourself comfortable, and enjoy
  the paperless magazine other magazines are writing about.
