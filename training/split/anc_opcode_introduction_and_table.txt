# NMOS 6510 - Introduction to the undocumented ANC (also called ANC2, ANA, ANB) instruction: described as a combination of immediate AND with A plus a following implied shift/rotate sub-instruction (AND then ASL/ROL behavior). Presents the opcode table entries shown here, including $0B and $2B, the mnemonic form 'ANC #imm', the function 'A = A & #imm', the instruction size (2) and cycles (2), and the affected flags (N, V, C etc as indicated in the table).
