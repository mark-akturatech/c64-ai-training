  B-27. Function Name: SECOND

    Purpose: Send secondary address for LISTEN
    Call address: $FF93 (hex) 65427 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A

    Description: This routine is used to send a secondary address to an
  I/O device after a call to the LISTEN routine is made, and the device is
  commanded to LISTEN. The routine canNOT be used to send a secondary
  address after a call to the TALK routine.
    A secondary address is usually used to give setup information to a
  device before I/O operations begin.
    When a secondary address is to be sent to a device on the serial bus,
  the address must first be ORed with $60.

  How to Use:

    1) load the accumulator with the secondary address to be sent.
    2) Call this routine.

    ;ADDRESS DEVICE #8 WITH COMMAND (SECONDARY ADDRESS) #15
    LDA #8
    JSR LISTEN
    LDA #15
    JSR SECOND
