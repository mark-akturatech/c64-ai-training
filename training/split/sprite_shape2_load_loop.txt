# COMMODORE 64 - Explains LINE 25 which defines the second sprite shape by POKEing 63 DATA values into memory 12352–12414. Notes that address 12351 is skipped (the 64th slot of the first block) and emphasizes that sprite shapes take 64 locations but only 63 contain sprite data. Covers FOR S2=12352 TO 12414, READ Q2, POKE S2,Q2 and NEXT behavior.

  LINE 25:

    FORS2=12352         The second shape of sprite zero is defined by the
    TO 12414            DATA which is located at locations 12352 to 12414.
                        NOTE that location 12351 is SKIPPED... this is the
                        64th location which is used in the definition of
                        the first sprite group but does not contain any of
                        the sprite data numbers. Just remember when
                        defining sprites in consecutive locations that you
                        will use 64 locations, but only POKE sprite data
                        into the first 63 locations.

    READQ2              Reads the 63 numbers which follow the numbers we
                        used for the first sprite shape. This READ simply
                        looks for the very next number in the DATA area and
                        starts reading 63 numbers, one at a time.

    POKES2,Q2           Pokes the data (Q2) into the memory locations (S2)
                        for our second sprite shape, which begins at
                        location 12352.

    NEXT                Same use as line 20 above.
