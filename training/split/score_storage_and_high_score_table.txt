# Contents - Practical scoring considerations: reserve enough bytes to store extremely high scores to avoid rollover; provide optional high-score tables to let top players record names for competition.

Note: When you first decide on a scoring 
method, be sure to reserve enough bytes for the 
score to accommodate an extremely high scoring 



player. This will avoid the rollover when the score 
changes from all 9s to all Os. Never assume that just 
because you can't get over a certain score that no 
one can. 

As an added feature, you may wish to include 
a feature that allows the highest scoring players to 
place their names on a scoreboard. Although not 
necessary, this feature can add to the competition 
between a number of players.
