# ********* - Detailed explanation of VMCSB ($D018) upper and lower nybbles: lower 3 bits select character dot-data area offset in 1K even multiples, upper 4 bits select Video Matrix start 1K boundary (0-15). Notes about relocating screen: need to set BASIC's screen page at location 648 when moving Video Matrix, and examples of calculating actual address depending on VIC bank choice.

VIC-II Color Register

Although these color registers are used for various purposes, all of
them have one thing in common.  Like the Color RAM Nybbles, only the
lower four bits are connected.  Therefore, when reading these
registers, you must mask out the upper four bits (that is,
BORDERCOLOR=PEEK(53280)AND15) in order to get a true reading.

53280         $D020          EXTCOL
Border Color Register

The color value here determines the color of the border or frame
around the central display area.  The entire screen is set to this
color when the blanking feature of Bit 4 of 53265 ($D011) is enabled.
The default color value is 14 (light blue).

53281         $D021          BGCOL0
Background Color 0

This register sets the background color for all text modes, sprite
graphics, and multicolor bitmap graphics.  The default color value is
6 (blue).

53282         $D022          BGCOL1
Background Color 1

This register sets the color for the 01 bit-pair of multicolor
character graphics, and the background color for characters having
screen codes 64-127 in extended background color text mode.  The
default color value is 1 (white).

53283         $D023          BGCOL2
Background Color 2

This register sets the color for the 10 bit-pair of multicolor
character graphics, and the background color for characters habing
screen codes 128-191 in extended background color text mode.  The
default color value is 2 (red).

53285         $D024          BGCOL3
Background Color 3

This register sets the background color for characters having screen
codes between 192 and 255 in extended background color text mode.  The
default color value is 3 (cyan).

53285         $D025          SPMC0
Sprite Multicolor Register 0

This register sets the color that is displayed by the 01 bit-pair in
multicolor sprite graphics.  The default color value is 4 (purple).

53286         $D026          SPMC1
Sprite Multicolor Register 1

This register sets the color that is displayed by the 11 bit-pair in
multicolor sprite graphics.  The default color value is 0 (black).

Location Range: 53287-53294 ($D027-$D02E)
Sprite Color Registers

These registers are used to set the color to be displayed by bits of
hi-res sprite data having a value of 1, and by bit-pairs of multicolor
sprite data having a value of 10.  The color of each sprite is
determined by its own individual color register.

53287         $D027          SP0COL
Sprite 0 Color Register (the default color value is 1, white)

53288         $D028          SP1COL
Sprite 1 Color Register (the default color value is 2, red)

53289         $D029          SP2COL
Sprite 2 Color Register (the default color value is 3, cyan)

53290         $D01A          SP3COL
Sprite 3 Color Register (the default color value is 4, purple)

53291         $D01B          SP4COL
Sprite 4 Color Register (the default color value is 5, green)

53292         $D01C          SP5COL
Sprite 5 Color Register (the default color value is 6, blue)

53293         $D01D          SP6COL
Sprite 6 Color Register (the default color value is 7, yellow)

53294         $D01E          SP7COL
Sprite 7 Color Register (the default color value is 12, medium gray)

Location Range: 53295-53311 ($D02F-$D03F)
Not Connected

The VIC-II chip has only 47 registers for 64 bytes of possible address
space.  Therefore, the remaining 17 addresses do not access any
memory.  When read, they will always give a value of 255 ($FF).  This
value will not change after writing to them.

Location Range: 53312-54271 ($D040-$D3FF)
