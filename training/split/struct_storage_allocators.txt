# ca65 Users Guide - Storage allocator keywords for struct/union members: .BYTE/.RES (1 byte multiples; .RES requires operand), .DBYT/.WORD/.ADDR (2-byte multiples), .FARADDR (3 bytes), .DWORD (4 bytes), .TAG (allocates a previously defined struct), .STRUCT/.UNION (begin nested definitions and allocate).


15.3 The storage allocator keywords

.BYTE, .RES
Allocates multiples of 1 byte. .RES requires an operand.

.DBYT, .WORD, .ADDR
Allocates multiples of 2 bytes.

.FARADDR
Allocates multiples of 3 bytes.

.DWORD
Allocates multiples of 4 bytes.

.TAG
Allocates a previously defined struct.

.STRUCT, .UNION
Begins a nested .struct or .union definition, and allocates it. Note that its member offset values will begin at 0, unless this nested structure is anonymous, in which case they will instead become members of the enclosing scope.
