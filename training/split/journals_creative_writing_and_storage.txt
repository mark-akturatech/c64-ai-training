# COMMODORE 64 - JOURNALS AND CREATIVE WRITING entry describing upcoming/existing word processing systems, saving documents to 1541 Disk Drive or Datassette, and printing via VIC-PRINTER or PLOTTER.

  JOURNALS AND            The COMMODORE 64 will soon offer an exceptional
  CREATIVE WRITING        wordprocessing system that matches or exceeds
                          the qualities and flexibilities of most "high-
                          priced" wordprocessors available. Of course you
                          can save the information on either a 1541 Disk
                          Drive or a Datassette TM recorder and have it
                          printed out using a VIC-PRINTER or PLOTTER.
