# byRiclianll - Header and the first part of the raw disk block dump for TRACK 17 - SECTOR 14. Includes the printed track/sector header and the initial byte rows showing repeated 'OO' markers and zero bytes (the beginning of the continued fixed-length record and DOS padding). Covers the block's opening offsets up to (but not including) the 0x18 offset label.
