# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - After exponents are equal (alignment complete), test sign relationship (BIT on sign compare). If signs indicate addition, branch to add-mantissa path; otherwise set Y index to point to the larger operand's mantissa (choose correct Y/X mapping) and set carry for subtraction to prepare for the mantissa-subtract sequence.

                                exponents are equal now do mantissa subtract
.,B8A3 24 6F    BIT $6F         test sign compare (FAC1 EOR FAC2)
.,B8A5 10 57    BPL $B8FE       if = add FAC2 mantissa to FAC1 mantissa and return
.,B8A7 A0 61    LDY #$61        set the Y index to FAC1 exponent address
.,B8A9 E0 69    CPX #$69        compare X to FAC2 exponent address
.,B8AB F0 02    BEQ $B8AF       if = continue, Y = FAC1, X = FAC2
.,B8AD A0 69    LDY #$69        else set the Y index to FAC2 exponent address
                                subtract the smaller from the bigger (take the sign of
                                the bigger)
.,B8AF 38       SEC             set carry for subtract
