# byRiclianll - Final portion of the Track 17, Sector 03 dump (remaining bytes to end of sector). Contains trailing NULs (0x00), a few non-zero bytes (for example a 0x64 at line 11002), and a small summary/grid of byte columns (labels D8:, E0:, E8:, F0:, F8: lines) with a compact 5x5-like matrix of byte values (00 / 'oo' used in the dump) representing a visual summary or bit-pattern sample. Ends with blank lines that conclude the sector dump.
