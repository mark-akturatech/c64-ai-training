# MACHINE - Commodore 64 overview: similar to VIC-20 with 6510 CPU (addresses 0/1 for bank switching); consistent BASIC start and screen memory at $0400; a bank of RAM at $C000-$CFFF useful for staging machine code; sometimes desirable to write entirely in machine language (swap out BASIC). SYS command allows preloading A/X/Y like VIC.

Commodore 64
------------

The Commodore 64 has much in common with the VIC-20.  In particular, its zero
page organization is almost identical to that of VIC.  The Commodore 64 comes
with a 6510 microprocessor; addresses 0 and 1 are reserved for "bank
switching" of memory.

                                                                        :158:

BASIC is identical to that of the VIC--no special disk commands and
potentially slow garbage collection.  There's no built-in machine language
monitor, so one must be loaded.  The SYS command, as with the VIC, allows
preloading of registers A, X, and Y if desired.

The Commodore 64 has a more stable architecture than the VIC.  BASIC starts
in a consistent place, and the screen is always at hex 0400 unless you move
it.  There's a bank of memory at $C000 to $CFFF that is not used by the
computer system; it's useful for staging machine language coding.

The Commodore 64 is the first Commodore machine in which it is sometimes
desirable to write totally in machine language, with no BASIC at all.  BASIC
can be swapped out to release extra RAM, and large applications (word
processors, spread sheets, and so on) are likely to do this.
