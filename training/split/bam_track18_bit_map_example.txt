# byRiclianll - Example decoding of BAM entry for track 18 (the directory track): shows bytes $EC, $FF, $07 corresponding to binary patterns and explains free sectors mapping (e.g., 16 sectors free as indicated by first byte $10). Demonstrates how partial (third) bitmap byte is used since max sectors per track is 21.

To  ensure  that  you  understand  how  the  bit  mapping  works,  let's  take  a  look  at  track 
18.  Since  track  18  is  used  for  storing  the  directory  we  would  expect  some  allocation  of 
sectors  here.  Byte  72  shows  $10  or  16  sectors  available  here.  They  are  bit  mapped  in 
bytes  73,  74,  and  75  as  follows: 


48:    lO  EC  FF  07  OO  OO  OO  OO 
**  **  **  **

O  =  ALLOCATED 


If  you  are  still  unsure  of  yourself,  don't  be  too  concerned.  The  DOS  looks  after  the  BAM. 
Let's  move  on  and  explore  the  actual  directory  entries  themselves.  Sectors  1  through 
18  on  track  18  are  reserved  specifically  for  them.
