# byRiclianll - COPY command syntax: OPEN 15,8,15 ; PRINT#15,"CO:NEW=0:ORIGINAL" ; CLOSE 15. 'C' short for COPY. Restrictions: new file must have different name, COPY doesn't work on relative files, and there must be enough space on the disk. Drive numbers are optional on single-drive setups.

The  Copy  Command 

The  copy  command  allows  you  to  easily  backup  an  existing  file  on  your  diskette.  There 
are  three  restrictions  attached.  First,  the  new  file  must  have  a  different  name.  Second, 
the  copy  command  will  not  work  on  a  relative  file.  Third,  you  must  have  enough  room 
on  the  diskette.  The  copy  command  looks  like  this: 

SYNTAX : 

OPEN   15,    8,  15 

PRINT#15,    "CO: B ACKUP=0 : OR I G I N AL " 
CLOSE  15 

ALTERNATE: 

PR I NT# 1 5 ,    " C : B ACKUP=OR I G I N AL " 

EXAMPLE: 

OPEN   15,    8,  15 

PRINT#15,    "CO: MY  PROGRAM  B/U=0:MY  PROGRAM" 
CLOSE  15 

DOS  5. l: 

>CO : BACKUP=0 : OR I G I NAL 
>C : BACKUP=OR I G I NAL 

The  C  is  short  for  COPY.  The  new  file  above  is  called  MY  PROGRAM  B/U.  It  is  a  backup 
copy  of  a  previous  program  called  MY  PROGRAM.  Note  that  we  must  specify  the  drive 
number  twice.  Again  this  is  a  holdover  from  a  dual  drive  configuration.  The  C  does  not 
appear  twice,  however.  The  same  restrictions  that  apply  to  the  rename  command  are 
also  in  effect  here,  i.e.,  16  character  file  name  limit,  use  of  restricted  characters,  etc. 
The  drive  number  is  optional.  See  the  alternate  syntax  to  save  a  few  keystrokes.
