# Kick Assembler - Explains intermediate segments used when segments are referenced by other directives (e.g., .file). The .file directive uses an implicit intermediate segment so you can pass parameters similar to .segment/.segmentdef. The 'name' parameter is special to the .file directive; other parameters are standard intermediate parameters.

.segmentout [sidFiles="data/music.sid"]

10.16. Debugger data
You can mark segments with a destination using the 'dest' parameter. A destination could be 'DISKDRIVE',
'BANK1', 'BANK2' etc. The parameter doesn't change anything, but is passed on to debuggers that can use the
value to organize debug data. For example labels defined in a segment which destination is the disk-drive, should
not be mixed with the code which is in the computer. The parameter is used like this:
.segmentdef [dest="DISKDRIVE"]

The meaning of each destination name is defined by the debugger.
