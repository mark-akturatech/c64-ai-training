# COMMODORE 64 - Maximum Ratings for the 6526 device and device protection note. Covers Supply Voltage, Input/Output Voltage, Operating and Storage Temperature limits, a note about input protection circuitry, and the 'COMMENT' section warning about absolute maximum ratings and potential device damage or reliability impact.























                                                           APPENDIX M   421
~


  MAXIMUM RATINGS

  Supply Voltage, Vcc                   -0.3V to +7.0V
  Input/Output Voltage, Vin             -0.3V to +7.0V
  Operating Temperature, Top             0 to 70 Celsius
  Storage Temperature, Tstg             -55 to 150 Celsius

    All inputs contain protection circuitry to prevent damage due to high
  static discharges. Care should be exercised to prevent unnecessary ap-
  plication of voltages in excess of the allowable limits.


  COMMENT

    Stresses above those listed under "Absolute Maximum Ratings" may cause
  permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings oily. Functional
  operation of this device at these or any other conditions above those
  indicated in the operational sections of this specification is not
  implied and exposure to absolute maximum rating conditions for extended
  periods may affect device reliability.
