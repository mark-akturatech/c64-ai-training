# CIA 6526 Complex Interface Adapter - Comprehensive Reference - Control Register A (CRA) at offset $0E. Read/Write. Bits: 0 START (start/stop Timer A), 1 PBON (route Timer A output to PB6), 2 OUTMODE (toggle vs pulse PB6), 3 RUNMODE (one-shot vs continuous), 4 LOAD (force load latch into counter; strobe, reads as 0), 5 INMODE (Timer A counts CNT positive edges when 1, PHI2 when 0), 6 SPMODE (serial port output when 1, input when 0), 7 TODIN (select 50 Hz when 1, 60 Hz when 0).

5.9  Control Register A (CRA) - Offset $0E
-------------------------------------------------------------

Read/Write. Controls Timer A and related functions.

  Bit 0: START   - 1 = Start Timer A
                   0 = Stop Timer A

  Bit 1: PBON    - 1 = Timer A output on PB6
                   0 = PB6 is normal I/O

  Bit 2: OUTMODE - 1 = Toggle PB6 on each underflow
                   0 = Pulse PB6 for one cycle on underflow

  Bit 3: RUNMODE - 1 = One-Shot mode (timer stops after underflow)
                   0 = Continuous mode (timer reloads and continues)

  Bit 4: LOAD    - 1 = Force load latch value into timer counter
                   (This is a strobe bit; it always reads 0)

  Bit 5: INMODE  - 1 = Timer A counts positive CNT edges
                   0 = Timer A counts PHI2 clock pulses

  Bit 6: SPMODE  - 1 = Serial port = output (shift register driven
                        by Timer A)
                   0 = Serial port = input

  Bit 7: TODIN   - 1 = 50 Hz TOD clock input
                   0 = 60 Hz TOD clock input
