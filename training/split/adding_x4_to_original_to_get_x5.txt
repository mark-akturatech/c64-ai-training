# MACHINE - Code and explanation to form the original value times five. Shows CLC; LDA low byte ($033D); ADC low-byte original ($033F); store result back to $033D; then LDA high byte ($033C); ADC high-byte original ($033E); STA $033C. Explains that $033C/$033D now hold the original value times five.

                                                                        :107:

Since we have the original number times four in $033D/$033C, we can add it to
the original number in $033F/$033E to get the original number times five:

  .A 08A0  CLC
  .A 08A1  LDA $033D
  .A 08A4  ADC $033F
  .A 08A7  STA $033D
  .A 08AA  LDA $033C
  .A 08AD  ADC $033E
  .A 08B0  STA $033C
