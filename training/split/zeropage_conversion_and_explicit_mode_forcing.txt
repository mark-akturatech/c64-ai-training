# Kick Assembler - Explains assembler behavior for choosing zeropage vs absolute addressing: the assembler automatically converts arguments to zeropage mode when possible (e.g., lda $0030 becomes zeropage). Shows how to force a specific addressing form using mnemonic suffixes .a / .abs for absolute and .z / .zp for zeropage, with examples (lda.abs $0040,x, lda.a $0030,x, stx.zp zpLabel,y). Also shows defining a label (.label zpLabel = $10) and notes that forcing a mode on a mnemonic that doesn't support it has no effect (jmp.z $1000).

An argument is converted to its zeropage mode if possible. This means that lda $0030 will generate an lda
command in its zeropage mode1
You can force the assembler to use the absolute form of the mnemonic by appending .a or .abs. The same way
you can tell the assembler to use zeropage mode when it would otherwise use an absolute mode.
lda.abs $0040,x
// Uses absolute mode
lda.a $0030,x
// Same as abs (abbreviation)
stx.zp zpLabel,y // Uses zeropage mode
stx.z zpLabel,y
// Same as zp (abbreviation)
.label zpLabel = $10
jmp.z $1000 // Modifies nothing, jmp don't have any zp mode
