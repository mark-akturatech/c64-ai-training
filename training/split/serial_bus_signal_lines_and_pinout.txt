# COMMODORE 64 - Lists the six serial bus signal lines (3 inputs and 3 outputs) used for data, control, and timing between the Commodore 64 and external serial devices. Includes an ASCII serial I/O pin mapping table: pin 1 /SERIAL SRQ IN, pin 2 GND, pin 3 SERIAL ATN OUT, pin 4 SERIAL CLK IN/OUT, pin 5 SERIAL DATA IN/OUT, pin 6 /RESET, with an accompanying connector diagram.

    There are 6 lines used in serial bus operations - input and 3 output.
  The 3 input lines bring data, control, and timing signals into the Com-
  modore 64. The 3 output lines send data, control, and timing signals from
  the Commodore 64 to external devices on the serial bus.
