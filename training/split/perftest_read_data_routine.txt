# ********* - Read-data subroutine (label at 1990): prints 'reading data', waits for a keypress to start, loops from 1000 to 2000 reading each record from the file (INPUT# ch,j), compares the read value to the expected index and prints a 'read error' message and calls the I/O status routine (GOSUB 1850) if any mismatch occurs; after the loop calls the I/O status routine and closes the channel before returning. Used to verify file integrity after writing.

 1980 :
 1990 print "reading data"
 2000 get a$
 2010 for i=1000 to 2000
 2020 input# ch,j
 2030 if j<>i then print "{reverse on}read error:{reverse off}":\
      gosub 1850
 2040 next
 2050 gosub 1850
 2060 close ch:return
