$FFB1          command devices on the serial bus to LISTEN
               
               This routine will command a device on the serial bus to receive data. The
               accumulator must be loaded with a device number between 4 and 31 before calling
               this routine. LISTEN convert this to a listen address then transmit this data as
               a command on the serial bus. The specified device will then go into listen mode
               and be ready to accept information.
