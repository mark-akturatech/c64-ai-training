# Contents - Explains that most assemblers output an intermediate (often hex) file containing program information in hexadecimal form for transfer; describes the loader program that translates the hex file to a binary file and places data in the correct memory locations.

The output of most assemblers is an in- 
termediate file that contains all of the information 
needed about your program. This file is usually one 
form of a hex file. Hex files store the information 
about the program in a hexadecimal format that can 
be easily transmitted or loaded into the computer. 
(Binary data is more difficult to transfer from one 
machine to another.) You will use a program called 
a loader to translate the hex file into a binary file 
and place the data in the proper place in the 
computer.
