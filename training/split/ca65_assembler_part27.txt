# CA65 Assembler - Control Commands (.FILEOPT .FORCEIMPORT .GLOBAL .GLOBALZP .HIBYTES)

11.42 .FILEOPT, .FOPT
Insert an option string into the object file. There are two forms of this command, one specifies the option by a keyword, the second specifies it as a number. Since usage of the second one needs knowledge of the internal encoding, its use is not recommended and I will only describe the first form here.

The command is followed by one of the keywords


        author
        comment
        compiler
  
a comma and a string. The option is written into the object file together with the string value. This is currently unidirectional and there is no way to actually use these options once they are in the object file.

Examples:


        .fileopt        comment, "Code stolen from my brother"
        .fileopt        compiler, "BASIC 2.0"
        .fopt           author, "J. R. User"
  
11.43 .FORCEIMPORT
Import an absolute symbol from another module. The command is followed by a comma separated list of symbols to import. The command is similar to .IMPORT, but the import reference is always written to the generated object file, even if the symbol is never referenced ( .IMPORT will not generate import references for unused symbols).

Example:


        .forceimport    needthisone, needthistoo
  
See: .IMPORT

11.44 .GLOBAL
Declare symbols as global. Must be followed by a comma separated list of symbols to declare. Symbols from the list, that are defined somewhere in the source, are exported, all others are imported. Additional .IMPORT or .EXPORT commands for the same symbol are allowed.

Example:


        .global foo, bar
  
11.45 .GLOBALZP
Declare symbols as global. Must be followed by a comma separated list of symbols to declare. Symbols from the list, that are defined somewhere in the source, are exported, all others are imported. Additional .IMPORTZP or .EXPORTZP commands for the same symbol are allowed. The symbols in the list are explicitly marked as zero page symbols.

Example:


        .globalzp foo, bar
  
11.46 .HIBYTES
Define byte sized data by extracting only the high byte (that is, bits 8-15) from each expression. This is equivalent to .BYTE with the operator '>' prepended to each expression in its list.

Example:


        .lobytes         $1234, $2345, $3456, $4567
        .hibytes         $fedc, $edcb, $dcba, $cba9
  
which is equivalent to


        .byte            $34, $45, $56, $67
        .byte            $fe, $ed, $dc, $cb
  
Example:


        .define MyTable TableItem0, TableItem1, TableItem2, TableItem3

        TableLookupLo:   .lobytes MyTable
        TableLookupHi:   .hibytes MyTable
  
which is equivalent to


        TableLookupLo:   .byte <TableItem0, <TableItem1, <TableItem2, <TableItem3
        TableLookupHi:   .byte >TableItem0, >TableItem1, >TableItem2, >TableItem3
