# Kick Assembler - Explains providing a template string to LoadBinary to describe memory blocks inside the file so returned value has getXSize/getX functions per block. Example template: "Xcoord=0,Ycoord=$100, BounceData=$200" and special template tag 'C64FILE' which tells LoadBinary to ignore the first two address bytes of native C64 files.

BF_C64FILE

A C64 file (The two first bytes are
skipped)

BF_BITMAP_SINGLECOLOR

ScreenRam,Bitmap

The Bitmap single color format outputted from Timanthes.

BF_KOALA
