# COMMODORE 64 - LOG(numeric): returns natural logarithm (base e) of argument. Error if argument <= 0 (ILLEGAL QUANTITY). Example of computing base-10 log via change of base using LOG(ARG)/LOG(10).


  LOG

  TYPE: Floating-Point Function
  FORMAT: LOG(<numeric>)

    Action: Returns the natural logarithm (log to the base of e) of the
  argument. If the value of the argument is zero or negative the BASIC
  error message ?ILLEGAL QUANTITY will occur.

  EXAMPLES of LOG Function:

    25 PRINT LOG(45/7)
     1.86075234

    10 NUM=LOG(ARG)/LOG(10)  (Calculates the LOG of ARG to the base 10)
