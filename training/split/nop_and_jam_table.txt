# NMOS 6510 - Table and explanations of NOP variants and JAM (KIL) behavior: lists many NOP opcodes (including multi-byte 'DOP' variants), their addressing modes, and the JAM opcodes that lock/halt the CPU (buses set to $FF). Includes notes about specific problematic opcodes ($D2/$F2 causing CPU lock-up).
