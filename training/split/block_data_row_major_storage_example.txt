# Multidirectional Scrolling Techniques by Cadaver - Example of block data storage: a block drawn row-by-row (e.g. ABCD / EFGH / IJKL / MNOP) is stored in memory sequentially as 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP' — i.e., row-major order.

The data for each block is stored similarly, each horizontal row sequentially.
For example the following-looking block:
ABCD
EFGH
IJKL
MNOP
would simply be stored in the memory as ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP
