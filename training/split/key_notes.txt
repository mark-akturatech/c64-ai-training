# Commodore 64 Complete Memory Map - Source: sta.c64.org - Key notes covering bank switching and system defaults: processor port $0001 controls visibility of BASIC/KERNAL/Character ROM and I/O area; CIA#2 Port A bits 0-1 select the VIC-II 16KB video bank; default configuration places BASIC at $0801, screen memory at $0400 and color RAM at $D800 with BASIC/KERNAL visible and I/O active.

Key Notes
=========

Bank Switching:
  The processor port at $0001 controls visibility of BASIC ROM ($A000-$BFFF),
  KERNAL ROM ($E000-$FFFF), Character ROM ($D000-$D7FF as text), and I/O area
  ($D000-$DFFF).

VIC Bank Selection:
  CIA#2 port A bits 0-1 select which 16KB bank the VIC-II chip accesses,
  allowing video memory location flexibility.

Default Configuration:
  The standard setup places BASIC programs at $0801, screen memory at $0400,
  and color RAM at $D800, with BASIC and KERNAL ROMs visible and I/O active.
