# ********* - Section 4.4: RENAME command to change a file name in the directory (PRINT#15,"R:newname=oldname"); fast directory-only operation and limitation that the file cannot be OPEN while renamed.


4.4 RENAME

This command allows you to change the name of a file once it is in the
disk directory.  This is a fast operation, since only the name in the
directory must be changed.

FORMAT FOR RENAME COMMAND:

   PRINT# 15, "RENAME:newname=oldname"

or abbreviated as

   PRINT# 15, "R:newname=oldname"

EXAMPLE OF RENAME COMMAND:

   PRINT#15, "R:MYRA=MYRON"

The RENAME command will not work on any files that are currently OPEN.
