# COMMODORE 64 - ARRAY VARIABLES: Single-, two- and three-dimensional array notation (e.g., XY(5), XY(5,5), XY(5,5,5)), mention that arrays may use subscripts 0-10 without DIM, and note that arrays with more than eleven elements must be DIMensioned.


  ARRAY VARIABLES

  Type                  Name
  Single Dimension      XY(5)
  Two-Dimension         XY(5,5)
  Three-Dimension       XY(5,5,5)

  Arrays of up to eleven elements (subscripts 0-10) can be used
  where needed. Arrays with more than eleven elements need to be
  DIMensioned.
