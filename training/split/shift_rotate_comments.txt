# MACHINE - Comments on shift/rotate: these instructions operate on A or directly on memory (LSR A vs LSR $addr). When applied to memory, flags N, Z, and C are affected according to resulting memory contents. Distinction logical vs arithmetic refers to sign treatment; bits themselves move the same way.


For this reason, you'll often see the instructions coded with the identity of
the A register coded in the address part of the instruction.  We would code
LSR A so as to distinguish from LSR $1234, where the contents of memory is
being shifted.

                                                                         :65:

When a rotate or shift is performed directly on a memory location, the Z, N,
and C flags are affected according to the contents of memory.  Z will be set
if the contents of the location ends up as zero; N if the high bit is set;
and C performs its standard role of catching the leftover bit.

Some programmers wonder about the terms logical and arithmetic, used as part
of the definition.  The distinction is related to the way that signed numbers
are treated.  "Logical" means that the sign of a number will be probably lost
if the number was intended to be signed.  "Arithmetic" means that the sign
will probably be preserved.  It's purely a terminology question:  the bits
themselves move exactly as you would expect them to do.
