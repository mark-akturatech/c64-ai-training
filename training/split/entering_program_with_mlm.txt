# MACHINE - Step-by-step: map assembled bytes to addresses starting at $033C, show listing with addresses and hex bytes, use .M 033C 0348 to display the target area, type over the hex bytes line-by-line (press RETURN to commit each line), and verify with another .M to ensure the program is correctly written to RAM.

Entering the Program
--------------------

We might rewrite our program one last time, marking in the addresses that
each instruction will occupy.  You will recall that we have decided to put
our program into memory starting at address $033C (part of the cassette
buffer).

  033C AD 80 03     LDA $0380
  033F AE 81 03     LDX $0381
  0342 8D 81 03     STA $0381
  0345 8E 80 03     STX $0380
  0348 00           BRK

Remember that most of the above listing is cosmetic.  The business end of the
program is the set of two-digit hex numbers shown to the left.  At the
extreme left, we have addresses--that's information, but not the program.  At
the right, we have the "source code"--our notes on what the program means.

How do we put it in?  Easy.  We must change memory.  So, we go to the MLM,
and display memory with

  .M 033C 0348

We might have anything in that part of memory, but we'll get a display that
looks something like

  .:033C xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx
  .:0344 xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx

You won't see "xx," of course; there will be some hexadecimal value printed
for each location.  Let's move the cursor back and change this display so
that it looks like this:

  .:033C AD 80 03 AE 81 03 8D 81
  .:0344 03 8E 80 03 00 xx xx xx

Don't type in the "xx"--just leave whatever was there before.  And be sure to
press RETURN to activate each line; if you move the cursor down to get to the
next line without pressing RETURN, the memory change would not happen.

Display memory again (.M 033C 0348) and make sure that the program is in
place correctly.  Check the memory display against the program listing, and
be sure you understand how the program is being transcribed into memory.
