# The MOS 6567/6569 video controller (VIC-II) and its application in the Commodore 64 - Practical advice for timing 6510 (CPU) accesses within a raster line: use VIC g-accesses as orientation by having the 6510 change a byte in graphics memory and observing on-screen which character shows the change first; the processor write will have occurred in the clock phase immediately before that visible change. Explains how to map that observation to the diagrams to determine the exact clock cycle and to count other accesses relative to it.


To time the accesses of the processor within a raster line when
programming, it's best to use the VIC g-accesses for orientation by
changing a byte in graphics memory with the 6510 and watching on the screen
on which character the change is first visible. The write access of the
processor must then have occurred in the clock phase immediately before.
Then you can use the diagrams to determine the clock cycle in which the
access took place and count the other accesses relative to it.
