# Contents - Explains what a symbol table is (names and corresponding addresses), how a printed symbol table aids verification and navigation, and why alphabetical sorting and resolved (absolute) addresses are important for usefulness of the listing.

Depending on how you approach debugging your 
program, these different functions will have dif- 
ferent levels of importance to you. 

A symbol table is generated by all assemblers 
at some point. It is a list of the names used in the 
program and the addresses that correspond to the 
names. A printout of the table can help you verify 
the assembler is working properly and gives you a 
quick guide to any location used by the program. 
For this reason it helps if the machine sorts the table 
alphabetically before printing. On the other hand, 
if the assembler only prints out the symbol names 
and its internal representation of the addresses 
(usually filled in later by the assembler), the 
printout is useless for most purposes.
