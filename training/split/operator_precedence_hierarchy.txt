# COMMODORE 64 - Hierarchy of operations when evaluating expressions: precedence from highest to lowest: ^ (exponentiation), unary - (negation), * and /, + and -, relational operators (> = <), NOT, AND, OR. Parentheses may override order; parentheses may be nested up to ten levels. Table 1-3 lists operators with examples.


  HIERARCHY OF OPERATIONS

    All expressions perform the different types of operations according to
  a fixed hierarchy. In other words, certain operations are performed be-
  fore other operations. The normal order of operations can be modified
  by enclosing two or more operands within parentheses ( ), creating a
  "subexpression." The parts of an expression enclosed in parentheses will
  be reduced to a single value before working on parts outside the par-
  entheses.
    When you use parentheses in expressions, they must be paired so that
  you always have an equal number of left and right parentheses. Otherwise,
  the BASIC error message ?SYNTAX ERROR will appear.
    Expressions which have operands inside parentheses may themselves
  be enclosed in parentheses, forming complex expressions of multiple
  levels. This is called nesting. Parentheses can be nested in expressions
  to a maximum depth of ten levels-ten matching sets of parentheses.
  The inner-most expression has its operations performed first. Some
  examples of expressions are:

                     A+B
                     C^(D+E)/2
                     ((X-C^(D+E)/2)*10)+1
                     GG$>HH$
                     JJ$+"MORE"
                     K%=1 AND M<>X
                     K%=2 OR (A=B AND M<X)
                     NOT (D=E)

    The BASIC Interpreter will normally perform operations on expressions
  by performing arithmetic operations first, then relational operations,
  and logical operations lost. Both arithmetic and logical operators have

  an order of precedence (or hierarchy of operations) within themselves. On
  the other hand, relational operators do not have an order of precedence
  and will be performed as the expression is evaluated from left to right.
    If all remaining operators in an expression have the same level of
  precedence then operations happen from left to right. When performing
  operations on expressions within parentheses, the normal order of pre-
  cedence is maintained. The hierarchy of arithmetic and logical opera-
  tions is shown in Table 1-3 from first to last in order of precedence.
