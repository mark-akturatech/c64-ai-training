# COMMODORE 64 - Shows a modification to the sine example to draw a semicircle by computing Y1 and Y2 using square root and plotting vertical columns between them. Contains pseudocode lines illustrating FOR loops and uses the same BYTE/BIT calculations. Note: original text has some typographical errors — algorithm outline is to compute upper/lower Y for each X and set bits across the vertical span.


    The calculation in line 60 will change the values for the sine function
  from a range of +1 to -1 to a range of 10 to 170. Lines 70 to 100
  calculate the character, row, byte, and bit being affected, using the
  formulae as shown above. Line 125 signals the program is finished by
  changing the color of the top left corner of the screen. Line 130 freezes
  the program by putting it into an infinite loop. When you have finished
  looking at the display, just hold down <RUN/STOP> and hit <RESTORE>.

    As a further example, you can modify the sine curve program to display
  a semicircle. Here are the lines to type to make the changes:


  50 FORX=0TO160:REM DO HALF THE SCREEN
  55 Y1=100+SQR(160*X-X*X)
  56 Y2=100-SQR(160*X-X*X)
  60 FORY=Y1TOY2STEPY1-Y2
  70 CH=INT(X/()
  80 RO=INT(Y/X)
  85 LNYAND7
  90 BY=BASE+RO*320+8*CH+LN
  100 BI=7-(XAND7)
  110 POKEBY,PEEK(BY)OR(2^BI)
  114 NEXT

  This will create a semicircle in the HI-RES area of the screen.
