# ********* - End-of-routine patch bytes that adjust for the extra length of the updated CINT routine to ensure correct timer setup for 1/60s IRQ.

65390         $FF6E
End of Routine to Set Timer for Sixtieth of a Second IRQ

This appears to be a patch added to compensate for the extra length of
the current version of this routine, which chooses either the PAL or
NTSC prescaler values for the timer.
