# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Details on how paddle fire buttons are read via CIA ports (Port B reads for Controller Port 1, Port A for Controller Port 2) at bits 2 and 3. Also explains that Port B bits 6/7 can be toggled/pulsed by Timer A/Timer B as an output alternative when configured in control registers.

                          Although the SID chip is used to read the paddle settings, the fire
                          buttons are read at CIA #1 Data Ports A and B.  The fire buttons for
                          the paddles plugged into Controller Port 1 are read at Data Port B
                          (56321, $DC01), while those for the paddles plugged into Controller
                          Port 2 are read from Data Port A (56320, $DC00).  The fire buttons are
                          read at Bit 2 and Bit 3 of each port (the same as the joystick left
                          and joystick right switches), and as usual, the bit will read 0 if the
                          corresponding button is pushed, and 1 if it is not.

                          Although only two of the rout paddle values can be read at any one
                          time, you can always read all four paddle buttons.  See the game
                          paddle input description at 54297 ($D419) for the BASIC statements
                          used to read these buttons.

                          Finally, Data Port B can also be used as an output by either Timer A
                          or B.  It is possible to set a mode in which the timers do not cause
                          an interrupt when they run down (see the descriptions of Control
                          Registers A and B at 56334-5 ($DC0E-F)).  Instead, they cause the
                          output on Bit 6 or 7 of Data Port B to change.  Timer A can be set
                          either to pulse the output of Bit 6 for one machine cycle, or to
                          toggle that bit from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1.  Timer B can use Bit 7 of this
                          register for the same purpose.
