# MACHINE - Project overview and BASIC driver program used to call machine language. Explains intent to place ML code after the end-of-BASIC, gives the example Commodore 64 BASIC listing (lines 100-150) which initializes V%, loops five times, reads VALUE into V%, calls ML with SYS, and prints the result.

Project:  We plan to place the machine language program behind the end-of-
BASIC.  This will vary, depending on the machine being used.  The following
code shows the correct addresses for the Commodore 64.  Refer to Appendix E
for other machines.

First, let's do our BASIC coding to estimate its size.  We need to guess at
the location of the end-of-BASIC so as to place our machine language program.
This program will ask machine language to take a value, V%, and multiply it
by ten.  Remember to say NEW.  We write the BASIC program as follows:

  100 V%=0
  110 FOR J=1 TO 5
  120 INPUT "VALUE";V%
  130 SYS ++++
  140 PRINT "TIMES TEN =";V%
  150 NEXT J
