# C64 KERNAL API (Lee Davison) - $FFA8 — Output a byte to the serial bus (full handshaking). Sends A as a data byte. Requires a prior LISTEN ($FFB1). Routine buffers one character; when UNLISTEN ($FFAE) is called, the buffered char is sent with EOI, then UNLISTEN is transmitted. Timeout or other errors reflected in status word.

$FFA8          output a byte to serial bus
               
               This routine is used to send information to devices on the serial bus. A call to
               this routine will put a data byte onto the serial bus using full handshaking.
               Before this routine is called the LISTEN routine, $FFB1, must be used to
               command a device on the serial bus to get ready to receive data.
               
               The accumulator is loaded with a byte to output as data on the serial bus. A
               device must be listening or the status word will return a timeout. This routine
               always buffers one character. So when a call to the UNLISTEN routine, $FFAE,
               is made to end the data transmission, the buffered character is sent with EOI
               set. Then the UNLISTEN command is sent to the device.
