# Contents - Describes loader option to relocate a program's loading address (useful for testing code in RAM while targeting cartridge or other fixed addresses), allowing testing in one memory location though intended to run elsewhere.

One potentially useful option on most loaders 
is the ability to relocate the loading address of a pro- 
gram. For example, if you write a program to be 
placed on a cartridge, it needs to run from a different 
place in memory than if it is to be stored in RAM. 
The ability to relocate a program allows you to test 
it in one location although it is intended to run at 
another.
