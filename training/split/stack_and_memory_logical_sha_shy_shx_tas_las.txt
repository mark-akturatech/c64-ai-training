# NMOS 6510 - Describes SHA ($93), SHY ($9F, $9C), SHX ($9E), TAS ($9B), and LAS ($BB) undocumented opcodes (lines 1433–1464). Lists their opcode bytes, the memory/SP interactions (e.g., {addr} = A & X & {H+1}, {addr} = Y & {H+1}, {addr} = X & {H+1}, SP = A & X, {addr} = SP & {H+1}, A,X,SP = {addr} & SP), and the observed flag behaviors (lines 1442–1474). This chunk focuses on opcodes that combine register logic with memory writes or affect the stack pointer.
