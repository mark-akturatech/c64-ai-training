# MACHINE - Notes for the instruction timing/opcode table (Figure A.4). Explains symbols used in the table: '!' (add 1 cycle if page boundary crossed), '@' (branch cycles if not taken or taken), M6/M7 memory bit notes, '#' (Borrow = Not Carry), '$' (decimal mode Z flag invalid and accumulator zero check), and includes Figure A.4 marker.

Notes:                                                         
! = Add 1 to "N" if page boundary is crossed                   x modified
@ = 2 cycles if branch does not occur                          - not modified
    3 cycles if branch occurs to same page                    M6 memory bit 6
    4 cycles if branch occurs to different page               M7 memory bit 7
# = Borrow = Not Carry                                         N no. cycles
$ = If in decimal mode, Z flag is invalid
    Accumulator must be checked for zero result
