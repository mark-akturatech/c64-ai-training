# ********* - Logic to present the next track/sector values and ask whether the user wants to display the next block. Prints 'next track and sector' using nb(1) and nb(2), prompts 'do you want next track and sector', reads z$, and branches: 'y' loads t,s with nb() and returns to the input/ load sequence; 'n' returns to top-of-input; otherwise loops waiting for valid response.
