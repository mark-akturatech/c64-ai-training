# MACHINE - Real-world anecdotes: students load ML into cassette buffer incorrectly and move SOV resulting in variables overwriting BASIC, SAVE writing enormous amounts, or memory moves wrapping and corrupting system—leading to lost confidence. Emphasizes verifying SOV pointer and understanding consequences.


Quiet Interlude

It's easy to see how the problem occurs, once you understand about the SOV
and its role.  But if you don't understand the SOV, the results can shake
your self-confidence.  Many programmers have given up on machine language
because of a bad experience with SOV.

                                                                         :99:

It works this way.  The student writes a perfect program into the cassette
buffer and saves it using the machine language monitor.  Later, with a BASIC
program in place, the student recalls the program and inadvertently moves SOV
to an impossible location.  When BASIC runs, the variables will start to be
written behind the machine language program, ahead of the BASIC program.  As
more and more variables come into play, they creep relentlessly toward the
BASIC coding.

Our eager student--with a perfect machine language program and a perfect
BASIC program--now decides to say RUN.  The BASIC program runs for a while,
and then grinds to a halt, usually with a crazy screen or reporting an error
in a nonexistent line.  We know what's happened, of course:  the variables
have started to write over the BASIC program.  But our unfortunate student
doesn't know that.  The command LIST is entered, and out comes nonsense.

What goes through the programmer's mind at this time?  "I was so sure that
the program is correct [in fact, it is]; but it's so bad that it's destroyed
memory!  I suppose that machine language is much more difficult than I
thought."

And the student loses hope and gives up, not knowing that there's only one
small piece of information needed to fix everything up.  This is only one of
the things that might go wrong when the SOV pointer is improperly placed;
even an attempt to change or save a BASIC program can cause system failure.

Such experiences destroy confidence.  They are responsible for the myth that
machine language is hard and only super-clever programmers can cope with it.
