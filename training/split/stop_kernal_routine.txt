# COMMODORE 64 - KERNAL STOP (call $FFE1 / 65505): Check if the <STOP> key was pressed during UDTIM. If <STOP> pressed, Z flag is set and channels reset to default. Otherwise accumulator contains byte representing lost row of keyboard scan. UDTIM should be called before STOP. Example uses JSR UDTIM ; JSR STOP ; BNE *+5 ; JMP READY.

    1) Call this routine.
    2) Test for the zero flag.
