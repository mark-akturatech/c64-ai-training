# CA65 Assembler - Control Commands (.ENUM .ERROR .EXITMACRO .EXPORT .EXPORTZP .FARADDR)

11.37 .EXPORT
Make symbols accessible from other modules. Must be followed by a comma separated list of symbols to export, with each one optionally followed by an address specification and (also optional) an assignment. Using an additional assignment in the export statement allows to define and export a symbol in one statement. The default is to export the symbol with the address size it actually has. The assembler will issue a warning, if the symbol is exported with an address size smaller than the actual address size.

Examples:


        .export foo
        .export bar: far
        .export foobar: far = foo * bar
        .export baz := foobar, zap: far = baz - bar
  
As with constant definitions, using := instead of = marks the symbols as a label.

See: .EXPORTZP

11.38 .EXPORTZP
Make symbols accessible from other modules. Must be followed by a comma separated list of symbols to export. The exported symbols are explicitly marked as zero page symbols. An assignment may be included in the .EXPORTZP statement. This allows to define and export a symbol in one statement.

Examples:


        .exportzp  foo, bar
        .exportzp  baz := $02
  
See: .EXPORT

11.39 .FARADDR
Define far (24 bit) address data. The command must be followed by a sequence of (not necessarily constant) expressions.

Example:


        .faraddr        DrawCircle, DrawRectangle, DrawHexagon
  
See: .ADDR

11.40 .FATAL
Force an assembly error and terminate assembly. The assembler will output an error message preceded by "User error" and will terminate assembly immediately.

This command may be used to check for initial conditions that must be set before assembling a source file.

Example:


        .if     foo = 1
        ...
        .elseif bar = 1
        ...
        .else
        .fatal  "Must define foo or bar!"
        .endif
