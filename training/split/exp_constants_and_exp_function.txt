# ********* - EXPCON (table of constants for EXP and LOG in five-byte FP format — used to calculate 2^N) and EXP (compute e^x: raise e to the power in FAC1, leave result in FAC1). Covers the exponential function and its supporting constants/tables.

49087         $BFBF          EXPCON
Table of Constants for EXP and LOG in Five-Byte Floating Point Format

These tables are used to calculate 2 to the N power.

49133         $BFED          EXP
Perform EXP

This routine calculates the natural logarithm e (2.718281828...)
raised to the power in FAC1.  The result is left in FAC1.
