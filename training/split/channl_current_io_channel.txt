# ********* - CHANNL ($13): current logical-file (CMD) number used by BASIC to determine the active input/output device for prompting and output control. Explains default device numbers (0=keyboard input, 3=screen output) and how nonzero values change TAB behavior, suppress the ? prompt, and alter handling of carriage returns and EXTRA IGNORED. Describes how OPEN/CMD set this location and how many BASIC routines reset it back to the screen; notes trickery to make BASIC read tape data as keyboard input and references the keyboard buffer technique at $200.

Current I/O Channel (CMD Logical File) Number

Whenever BASIC inputs or outputs data, it looks here to determine
which I/O device is currently active for the purpose of prompting or
output control.  It uses location 184 ($B8) for purposes of deciding
what device actually to put input from or output to.

When the default input device (number 0, the keyboard) or output
device (number 3, the display screen) is used, the value here will be
a zero, and the format of prompting and output will be the standard
screen output format.

When another device is used, the logical file number (CMD channel
number) will be placed here.  This lets the system now that it may
have to make some subtle changes in the way it performs the I/O
operation.  For example, if TAB is used with the PRINT command, cursor
right characters are used if the device PRINTed to is the screen.
Otherwise, spaces are output when the number here is other than zero
(the assumption being that you can't tab a printer like you can the
screen).

Likewise, the ? prompt for INPUT is suppressed if the file number here
is nonzero, as is the EXTRA IGNORED message, and input of a carriage
return by itself is ignored, rather than being treated as a null
string ("").  Therefore, by OPENing the screen as a device, and
issuing the CMD statement, you can force the suppression of the ?
prompt, and the other effects above.

CMD places the new output file number here, and calls the Kernal to
open the device for output, leaving it LISTENing for output (such as
the READY prompt, which is diverted to the new device).

Many routines reset this location and UNLISTEN the device, defeating
the CMD and once again sending the output to the screen.  If an error
message has to be displayed, for example, this location will be reset
and the message will be displayed on the screen.  GET, GET#, INPUT,
INPUT#, and PRINT# all will reset this location after the I/O is
completed, effectively redirecting output back to the screen.  PRINT
and LIST are the only I/O operations that will not undo the CMD.

This location can also be used to fool BASIC into thinking that data
it is reading from the tape is actually being entered into the
keyboard in immediate mode.

For a look at a technique that uses a different approach to accomplish
the same thing for disk or tape users, see location 512 ($200), the
keyboard buffer.
