# COMMODORE 64 - Specific crunching techniques: use of keyword abbreviations (Appendix A) and how abbreviations are tokenized and don't save memory in saved programs, shortening line numbers to reduce memory for GOTO/GOSUB references, and putting multiple instructions on a line separated by colons.

  SHORTENING PROGRAM LINE NUMBERS

    Most programmers start their programs at line 100 and number each fine
  at intervals of 10 (i.e., 100, 110, 120). This allows extra lines of
  instruction to be added (111, 112, etc.) as the program is developed.
  One means of crunching the program after it is completed is to change
  the fine numbers to the lowest numbers possible (i.e., 1, 2, 3) because
  longer line numbers take more memory than shorter numbers when referenced
  by GOTO and GOSUB statements. For instance, the number 100 uses 3 bytes
  of memory (one for each number) while the number I uses only 1 byte.

  PUTTING MULTIPLE INSTRUCTIONS ON EACH LINE

    You can put more than one instruction on each numbered line in your
  program by separating them by a colon. The only limitation is that all
  the instructions on each line, including colons, should not exceed the
  standard 80-character line length. Here is an example of two programs,
  before and after crunching:

  BEFORE CRUNCHING:              AFTER CRUNCHING:

  10 PRINT"HELLO...";            10 PRINT "HELLO...";:FORT=1TO500:NEXT:
  20 FOR T=1 TO 500: NEXT           PRINT"HELLO, AGAIN...":GOTO10
  30 PRINT"HELLO, AGAIN..."
  40 GOTO 10

  REMOVING REM STATEMENTS

    REM statements are helpful in reminding yourself-or showing other
  programmers - what a particular section of a program is doing. However,
  when the program is completed and ready to use, you probably

  won't need those REM statements anymore and you can save quite a bit of
  space by removing the REM statements. If you plan to revise or study the
  program structure in the future, it's a good idea to keep a copy on file
  with the REM statements intact.
