# ********* - LNMX ($D5), TBLX ($D6), and ASCII temp ($D7). LNMX explains how the editor determines whether a new physical line can be added to the current logical line (maximum physical line length). TBLX stores the current cursor physical screen line number (0–24) and can be POKEd to move the cursor vertically (example provided). The ASCII temporary location holds the ASCII value of the last character printed to the screen.

Maximum Length of Physical Screen Line

The line editor uses this location when the end of a line has been
reached to determine whether another physical line can be added to the
current logical line, or if a new logical line must be started.

Current Cursor Physical Line Number

This location contains the current physical screen line position of
the cursor (0-24).  It can be used in a fashion to move the cursor
vertically, by POKEing the target screen line (1-25) minus 1 here,
followed by a PRINT command.  For example,

POKE 214,9:PRINT:PRINT "WE'RE ON LINE ELEVEN"

prints the message on line 11.  The first PRINT statement allows the
system to update the other screen editor variables so that they will
also show the new line.  The cursor can also be set or read using the
Kernal PLOT routine (58634, $E50A) as explained in the entry from
locations 780-783 ($30C-$30F).

Temporary Storage Area for ASCII Value of Last Character Printed

The ASCII value of the last character printed to the screen is held
here temporarily.
