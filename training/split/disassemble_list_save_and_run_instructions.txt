# MACHINE - Instructions to verify the ML placement: disassemble and check, return to BASIC, LIST to view the BASIC program (ML is hidden), save to include ML with BASIC, then RUN the BASIC program and test entering numbers to confirm they are multiplied by ten.

Check...disassemble...and then back to BASIC.  LIST, and you'll see your
BASIC program again.  There's no sign of the machine language program, of
course, but SAVE will now save everything together.

RUN the BASIC program.  Enter the numbers as requested.  Confirm that they
are multiplied by ten.
