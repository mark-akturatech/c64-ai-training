# MACHINE - More on MLM availability and usage: monitors can be extended or replaced, come on cartridges or as ROM/RAM loads, can be bought or club-provided. Advises obtaining/starting a monitor and gives machine-specific examples to enter it (SYS 4 for PET/CBM, SYS 8 for VIC/C64, MONITOR on PLUS/4).


The Machine Language Monitor
----------------------------

Most PET/CBM computers have a simple MLM (machine language monitor) built in.
It may be extended with extra commands.  The Commodore PLUS/4 contains a very
powerful MLM.  The VIC-20 and Commodore 64 do not have a built-in MLM, but
one can be added.  Such a monitor may be either loaded into RAM or plugged in
as a cartridge.  Monitors may be purchased or obtained from user clubs.

Most machine language monitors work in a similar way, and have about the same
commands.  To proceed, you'll need an MLM in your computer.  Use the built-in
one, plug it in, load it in, or load and run...whatever the instructions tell
you.  On a PET/CBM machine, typing the command SYS 4 will usually switch you
to the built-in monitor.  After an MLM has been added to a VIC or Commodore
64, the command SYS 8 will usually get you there.  On the Commodore PLUS/4,
the BASIC command MONITOR will bring the monitor into play.
