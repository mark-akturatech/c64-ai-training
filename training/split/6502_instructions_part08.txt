          BIT Test Bits in Memory with Accumulator
              bits 7 and 6 of operand are transfered to bit 7 and 6 of SR (N,V);
              the zero-flag is set according to the result of the operand AND
              the accumulator (set, if the result is zero, unset otherwise).
              This allows a quick check of a few bits at once without affecting
              any of the registers, other than the status register (SR).
