# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - CIA #2 Interrupt Control Register at $DD0D: bits and behavior identical to CIA #1 ($DC0D) — bits 0-4 indicate Timer A, Timer B, TOD alarm, serial shift complete, FLAG line; bits 5-6 unused; bit 7 indicates any CIA#2 source caused an interrupt. Writing uses bit7 to determine set/clear of mask bits. Main difference: FLAG line for CIA #2 is connected to User Port pin B and is available for user handshaking.

$DD0D        CI2ICR       Interrupt Control Register

                     0    Read / did Timer A count down to 0?  (1=yes).
                          Write/ enable or disable Timer A interrupt (1=enable, 0=disable)
                     1    Read / did Timer B count down to 0?  (1=yes).
                          Write/ enable or disable Timer B interrupt (1=enable, 0=disable)
                     2    Read / did Time of Day Clock reach the alarm time?  (1=yes).
                          Write/ enable or disable TOD clock alarm interrupt (1=enable,
                          0=disable)
                     3    Read / did the serial shift register finish a byte?  (1=yes).
                          Write/ enable or disable serial shift register interrupt (1=enable,
                          0=disable)
                     4    Read / was a signal sent on the FLAG line?  (1=yes).
                          Write/ enable or disable FLAG line interrupt (1=enable, 0=disable)
                     5    Not used
                     6    Not used
                     7    Read / did any CIA #2 source cause an interrupt?  (1=yes).
                          Write/ set or clear bits of this register (1=bits written with 1 will
                          be set, 0=bits written with 1 will be cleared)

                          This register is used to control the five interrupt sources on the
                          6526 CIA chip.  For details on its operation, see the entry for 56333
                          ($DC0D).  The main difference between these two chips pertaining to
                          this register is that on CIA #2, the FLAG line is connected to Pin B
                          of the User Port, and thus is available to the user who wishes to take
                          advantage of its ability to cause interrupts for handshaking purposes.
