# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Clears a full screen line to spaces: sets Y counter to 39 (LDY #$27), fetches the screen address (JSR $E9F0), computes the colour-RAM pointer (JSR $EA24), saves the current colour to colour RAM (JSR $E4DA), loads the ASCII for space (LDA #$20) and stores it across the line via STA ($D1),Y while decrementing Y. Returns (RTS).
