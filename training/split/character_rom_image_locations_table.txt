# COMMODORE 64 - Describes ROM IMAGE locations (how character ROM appears to VIC-II depending on bank): lists specific VIC-II 'images' mapping to ranges containing upper case, graphics, reversed characters, and lower-case sets depending on block. Shows that character ROM and VIC-II control registers occupy same addresses but are switched in/out depending on access. Emphasizes that ROM image 'appears' only in the 16K bank currently seen by VIC-II.

    The ROM IMAGE in the above table refers to the character generator ROM.
  It appears in place of RAM at the above locations in bank 0. it  also
  appears in the corresponding RAM at locations 36864-40959 ($9000-$9FFF)
  in bank 2. Since the VIC-II chip can only access 16K of memory at a time,
  the ROM character patterns appear in the 16K block of memory the VIC-II
  chip looks at. Therefore, the system was designed to make the VIC-II chip
  think that the ROM characters are at 4096-8191 ($1000-$1FFF) when your
  data is in bank 0, and 36864-40959 ($9000-$9FFF) when your data is in
  bank 2, even though the character ROM is actually at location 53248-57343
  ($D000-$DFFF). This imaging only applies to character data as seen by the
  VIC-II chip. It can be used for programs, other data, etc., just like any
  other RAM memory.

  | NOTE: If these ROM images got in the way of your own graphics, then   |
  | set the BANK SELECT BITS to one of the BANKS without the images       |
  | (BANKS 1 or 3). The ROM patterns won't be there.                      |

   The location and contents of the character set in ROM are as follows:
