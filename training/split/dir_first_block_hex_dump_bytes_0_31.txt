# byRiclianll - Middle portion of the hex/ASCII dump for the first data block (continuation of Track 16, Sector 01). Contains token/ASCII fragments and numeric strings that correspond to the early bytes (roughly the next byte range after the header): hex-like tokens, ASCII digits and punctuation (examples: sequences like ",2,8, 15", numeric and punctuation runs, and short token-like items). Useful for inspecting how the block encodes initial BASIC/data content.
