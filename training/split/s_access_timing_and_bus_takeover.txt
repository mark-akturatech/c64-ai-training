# The MOS 6567/6569 video controller (VIC-II) and its application in the Commodore 64 - Describes timing of s-accesses (sprite data reads) relative to p-accesses: when a sprite needs data, three s-access half-cycles follow the p-access for that sprite within the same raster line. Explains VIC bus takeover using BA and AEC signals (BA goes low three cycles before the access) and that s-accesses occur in statically assigned cycles for visible sprites (done in every raster line the sprite is visible).


When s-accesses are necessary for a sprite, they are done in the three
half-cycles directly after the p-access belonging to the sprite within the
raster line. The VIC also uses the BA and AEC signals (as in the Bad Lines)
to access the bus in the second clock phase. BA will also go low three
cycles before the proper access in this case. The s-accesses are done in
every raster line in which the sprite is visible (for the sprites 0-2, it
is always in the line before, see the timing diagrams in section 3.6.3.),
for every sprite in statically assigned cycles within the line.
