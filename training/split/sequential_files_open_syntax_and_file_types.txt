# ********* - Chapter 5.1: Sequential files overview and OPEN syntax for sequential files (OPEN file#, device#, channel#, "0:name,type,direction"); file type codes (PRG, SEQ, USR, REL), replace option with @0:, and examples.



5. SEQUENTIAL FILES

5.1 OPEN

SEQuential files are limited by their sequential nature, which means
they must be read from beginning to end.  Data is transferred byte by
byte, through a buffer, onto the magnetic media.  To the disk drive
all files are created equal.  That is, SEQuential files, program files,
and user files all work the same on the disk.  Only program files can
be LOADed, but that's really the only difference.  Even the directory
works like this, except that it is read-only.  The only difference is
with relative files.

FORMAT FOR OPENING A SEQUENTIAL FILE:

   OPEN file#, device#, channel#, "0:name,type,direction"

The file number is the same as in all your other applications of the
OPEN statement, and it is used throughout the program to refer to this
particular file.  The device# is usually 8. The channel# is a data
channel, number 2 through 14.  It is convenient to use the same number
for both the channel# and file#, to keep them straight.  The name is
the file name (no wild cards or pattern matching if you're creating a
write file).  The type can be any of the ones from the chart below, at
least the first letter of each type. The direction must be READ or
WRITE, or at least the first letter of each.


 FILE TYPE   MEANING

 PRG         Program
 SEQ         Sequential
 USR         User
 REL         Relative

EXAMPLES OF OPENING SEQUENTIAL FILES:

   OPEN 2, 8, 2, "0:DATA, S, W"
   OPEN 8, 8, 8, "0:Program, P, R"
   OPEN A, B, C, "0:" + A$ + "U,W"

If the file already exists, you can use the replace option in the OPEN
statement, similar to the SAVE-and-replace described in chapter 3.
Simply add the @0: before the file's name in the OPEN statement.

EXAMPLE OF SEQUENTIAL FILE WITH REPLACE OPTION:

   OPEN 2, 8, 2, "@0:DATA,S,W"

The 0: should always precede the name of the file or the drive will
only allow you to use 2 of the available buffers.
