# MACHINE - Detailed explanation of the AND instruction applied to A, with a truth table showing how AND masks can turn bits off. Example showing how to turn off bits 4,5,6 of $C7 using AND #$8F (mask 10001111b) and the resulting value.

AND--Logical AND to A
---------------------

For each bit in the A register, AND performs the following action:


Original A Bit    Mask     Resulting A Bit
------------------------------------------
      0            0             0
      1            0             0
      0            1             0
      1            1             1


Examine the upper half of this table.  When the mask is zero, the original
bit in A is changed to zero.  Examine the lower half.  When the mask is one,
the original bit is left unchanged.  Hence, AND can selectively turn bits
off.

Example:  Turn off bits 4, 5, and 6 in the following value:  $C7

  Original value:      11000111
  Mask:            AND 10001111 (hex 8F)
                   ------------
  Result:              10000111
                        ^^^

Note that the bits marked have been forced to "off," while all the other bits
remain unchanged.
