# Kick Assembler - Demonstrates using .filenamespace to avoid name collisions across files. Example layout: /* FILE 0 */ calls to jsr part1.init etc, /* FILE 1 */ .filenamespace part1 with init/exec labels, and /* FILE 2 */ .filenamespace part2. Shows how placing .filenamespace at top of file scopes its labels.

You can also put new entities in the root scope when defining them from within another scope:
jsr outside_label
rts
{
@outside_label:
lda #0
sta $d020
sta $d020
rts
}

or:
{
.label @x = 1234
.var @y= "Hello world"
.const @z= true
}
.print "x="+x
.print "y="+y
.print "z="+z
