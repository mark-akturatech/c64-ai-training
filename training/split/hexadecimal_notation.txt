# MACHINE - Introduces hexadecimal as a compact human representation of binary: grouping bits in nibbles (4 bits), hex digit table mapping 0000..1111 to 0..F, notation using $ prefix (e.g. $12AC), and representation of 8-bit values with two hex digits (example: %01011011 = $5B).



Direct conversion between decimal and binary is seldom needed.  Such
conversions usually pass through an intermediate number system, called
hexadecimal.

Hexadecimal Notation
--------------------

Binary is an excellent system for the computer, but it is inconvenient for
most programmers.  If one programmer asks another, "What address should I use
for some activity?", an answer such as "Address %0001001010101100" might be
correct but would probably be unsatisfactory.  There are too many digits.

Hexadecimal is a code used by humans to conveniently represent binary
numbers.  The computer uses binary, not hexadecimal; programmers use
hexadecimal because binary is cumbersome.

To represent a binary number in hexadecimal, the bits must be grouped
together four at a time.  If we take the binary value given above and split
it into groups of four, we get

  0001 0010 1010 1100

Now each group of four bits is represented by a digit as shown in the
following table:

  0000 - 0     0100 - 4     1000 - 8     1100 - C
  0001 - 1     0101 - 5     1001 - 9     1101 - D
  0010 - 2     0110 - 6     1010 - A     1110 - E
  0011 - 3     0111 - 7     1011 - B     1111 - F

Thus, the number would be represented as hexadecimal 12AC.  A dollar sign is
often prefixed to a hexadecimal number so that it may be clearly recognized:
$12AC.

The same type of weighting is applied to each bit of the group of four as was
described before.  In other words, the rightmost bit (bit zero) has a weight
of 1, the next left a weight of 2, the next a weight of 4, and the leftmost
bit (bit three) a weight of 8.  If the total of the weighted bits exceeds
nine, an alphabetic letter is used as a digit:  A represents ten; B, eleven;
C, twelve; and F, fifteen.

Eight-bit numbers are represented with two hexadecimal digits.  Thus,
%01011011 may be written as $5B.
