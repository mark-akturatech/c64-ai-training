# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - When moving the cursor backwards from the start of a screen line, places the cursor at the end of the line above. Tests both column 0 and column 40 by adding $28 (40) and adjusting the logical line index. Uses PNTR ($D3) and TBLX ($D6).

                                When the cursor is at the beginning of a screen line, if
                                it is moved backwards, this routine places the cursor at
                                the end of the line above. It tests both column 0 and
                                column 40.
