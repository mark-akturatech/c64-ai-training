# NMOS 6510 - Pull operations (PLA, PLP) cycle behaviour: opcode fetch, dummy fetch PC+1, dummy fetch from stack, actual pull from stack and final read of pulled value with sequence of cycles and notes on dummy fetches.


+1 (*2) PC + 2 + offset (Old hi) Byte at PC + 2 + offset (Old hi)

R

(*1) Add one cycle if branch is taken, dummy read from PC + 2 (This would usually be the next
instruction)
(*2) Add one cycle if branch is taken across page boundaries (that means PC + 2 and PC + 2 +
offset are on different pages), dummy read from PC + 2 + offset (before the high byte was corrected
to point to the new/correct page)
