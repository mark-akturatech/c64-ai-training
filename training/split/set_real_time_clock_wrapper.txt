# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Wrapper at $FFDB that JMPs to $F6E4 to set the real time clock. Time in jiffies should be in YXA (A=most significant) before calling.

                                *** set the real time clock
                                the system clock is maintained by an interrupt routine that updates the clock
                                every 1/60th of a second. The clock is three bytes long which gives the capability
                                to count from zero up to 5,184,000 jiffies - 24 hours plus one jiffy. At that point
                                the clock resets to zero. Before calling this routine to set the clock the new time,
                                in jiffies, should be in YXA, the accumulator containing the most significant byte.
