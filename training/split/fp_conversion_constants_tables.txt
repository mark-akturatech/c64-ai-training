# ********* - FHALF (the constant 1/2 in five-byte FP format — used for rounding and SQR), FOUTBL (table of powers of -10 as four-byte FP numbers for conversion), and FDCEND (table of constants for TI$ conversion: powers of -60 times 1 or 10). Covers the constants and tables used by floating point to ASCII (and TI$) conversions.

48913         $BF11          FHALF
The Constant Value 1/2 in Five-Byte Floating Point Notation

This constant is used for rounding and SQR.

48924         $BF1C          FOUTBL
Powers of Minus Ten Constants Table

This table contains the powers of -10 expressed as four-byte floating
point numbers (that is, -1; +10; -100; +1000; -10,000; +100,000;
-1,000,000; +10,000,000; and -100,000,000).

48954         $BF3A          FDCEND
Table of Constants for TI$ Conversion

This table contains the floating point representation of the powers of
-60 multiplied by 1 or 10.  These constants are used for converting
TI$ to ASCII.
