# COMMODORE 64 - Quote Mode introduction: how entering a quote makes cursor controls display as reversed characters so they can be programmed in strings. Description of affected keys (all cursor controls except INST/DEL) and the list of cursor control types. Example showing how to PRINT the word HELLO diagonally using <HOME> and <DOWN> encoded inside a quoted string.



  Quote Mode

    Once the quote mark <SHIFT+2> is typed, the cursor controls stop
  operating and start displaying reversed characters which actually stand
  for the cursor control you are hitting. This allows you to program these
  cursor controls, because once the text inside the quotes is PRINTed they
  perform their functions. The <INST/DEL> key is the only cursor control
  not affected by "quote mode."

  1. Cursor Movement

    The cursor controls which can be "programmed" in quote mode are:

          KEY                             APPEARS AS

        <CLR/HOME>
        <SHIFT+CLR/HOME>
        <CRSR UP/DOWN>
        <SHIFT+CRSR UP/DOWN>
        <CRSR LEFT/RIGHT>
        <SHIFT+CRSR LEFT/RIGHT>


    If you wanted the word HELLO to PRINT diagonally from the upper left
  corner of the screen, you would type:

  PRINT"<HOME>H<DOWN>E<DOWN>L<DOWN>L<DOWN>O"
