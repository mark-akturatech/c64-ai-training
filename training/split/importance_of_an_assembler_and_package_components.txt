# Contents - Explains the central role of an assembler program in machine-language game development and lists the three essential parts of a good assembler package: a text editor, the assembler itself, and a machine-language monitor.

HOW TO CHOOSE AN ASSEMBLER 

If you are to successfully create your own 
machine language video games, you must become 
familiar with your primary design aid, the assembler 
program. Next to your computer, a good assembler 
program is the most essential tool for the creation 
of a machine language program. 

There are three parts to a good assembler 
package: 

• A text editor 

• The assembler 

• A machine language monitor
