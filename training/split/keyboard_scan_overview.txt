# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Commented overview of the keyboard-scan routine: describes steps performed by the scanner — 1) test if any key is pressed and exit if none, 2) initialize I/O ports and set pointers to decode table 1 and clear character counter, 3) drive one line of port B low and test port A for closed key by shifting the byte read and checking carry; if carry clear then a key is closed and should be processed. (This is the explanatory comment immediately following the IRQ handler.)

                                *** scan keyboard performs the following ..
                                
                                1) check if key pressed, if not then exit the routine
                                
                                2) init I/O ports of VIA ?? for keyboard scan and set pointers to decode table 1.

                                3) set one line of port B low and test for a closed key on port A by shifting the
                                byte read from the port. if the carry is clear then a key is closed so save the
