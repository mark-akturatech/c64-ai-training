# ca65 Users Guide - The -U, --auto-import option: mark symbols not defined in sources as imported symbols. Use with care because it defers errors for typos until linking. The compiler uses .AUTOIMPORT for runtime library symbols but assembler programmers may need to avoid relying on it.

-U, --auto-import
Mark symbols that are not defined in the sources as imported symbols. This should be used with care since it delays error messages about typos and such until the linker is run. The compiler uses the equivalent of this switch ( .AUTOIMPORT) to enable auto imported symbols for the runtime library. However, the compiler is supposed to generate code that runs through the assembler without problems, something which is not always true for assembler programmers.
