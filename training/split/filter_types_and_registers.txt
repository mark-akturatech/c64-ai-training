# COMMODORE 64 - Detailed SID filter control: Register 24 also contains filter enable bits in addition to volume. Bit 6 = high-pass (0=off/1=on), bit 5 = bandpass, bit 4 = low-pass. Low 3 bits of cutoff frequency are in register 21 (Lcf, 0–7), and high 8 bits in register 22 (Hcf, 0–255). Combining high- and low-pass yields notch filters; explains dynamic filtering during ADSR phases to create evolving timbres.

    Try RUNning the program now. Notice the lower tones have had their
  volume cut down. It makes the overall quality of the note sound tinny.
  This is because you are using a high-pass filter which attenuates (cuts
  down the level of) frequencies below the specified cutoff frequency.
    There are three types of filters in your Commodore computer's SID chip.
  We have been using the high-pass filter. It will pass all the frequencies
  at or above the cutoff, while attenuating the frequencies below the
  cutoff.

    The SID chip also has a low-pass filter. As its name implies, this
  filter will pass the frequencies below cutoff and attenuate those above.

                                FREQUENCY


    Finally, the chip is equipped with a bandpass filter, which passes a
  narrow band of frequencies around the cutoff, and attenuates all others.


                             |
                      AMOUNT |      +

                             |    /   \

                                FREQUENCY



    The high- and low-pass filters can be combined to form a notch reject
  filter which passes frequencies away from the cutoff while attenuating
  at the cutoff frequency.

    Register 24 determines which type filter you want to use. This is in
  addition to register 24's function as the overall volume control. Bit 6
  controls the high-pass filter (0 = off, 1 = on), bit 5 is the bandpass
  filter, and bit 4 is the low-pass filter. The low 3 bits of the cutoff
  frequency are determined by register 21 (Lcf) (Lcf = 0 through 7). While
  the 8 bits of the high cutoff frequency are determined by register 22
  (Hcf) (Hcf = 0 through 255).
    Through careful use of filtering, you can change the harmonic structure
  of any waveform to get just the sound you want. In addition, changing the
  filtering of a sound as it goes through the ADSR phases of its life can
  produce interesting effects.
