# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - If garbage appears in top/bottom border or during FLD, clear the last byte of the current VIC bank (e.g. $3FFF for default bank) but beware this may overwrite code/data and cause crashes.

Garbage in Vertical Border or Behind FLD
If you see black garbage in the top and bottom border or on the screen, while doing an FLD, and don't know how to get rid of it, simply clear the last byte of the current VIC bank, ie. $3fff for the first bank, $7fff for the second, and so on. Be warned though, that doing this without thought might give you other problems. If you have code in that memory position, setting $3fff to 0 might later crash your demo, or just make it misbehave.
