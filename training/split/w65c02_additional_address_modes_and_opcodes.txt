# 6502 Instruction Set - W65C02 additional address modes and instructions: (zeropage) indirect addressing for accumulator instructions and (absolute,X) for JMP; modified opcode lists for ADC, AND, BIT, CMP, DEC, EOR, INC, JMP (absolute,X) with cycles and opcodes for (zeropage) ind, BIT immediate, etc. Notes that 2004 datasheet had an erroneous cycle count for JMP (oper,X). Also lists additional LDA/ORA/SBC/STA forms for (zeropage) indirect.

          Western Design Center (WDC) W65C02(S) Extensions
                 The W65C02 features 69 instructions and 16 address modes (one of them a stack
                 mode, which was previously considered as implied) and static CMOS ciruitry.
                 There are two new address modes and 14 new instructions, as well as a few
                 behavioral changes.
                 (The G65SC02 by GTE Microcircuits is similar to W65C02 but doesn't implement
                 any of the new instructions for bit manipulation.)
                 Additional Address Modes (W65C02)
                 The W65C02 adds the following address modes:
                   zeropage indirect, (zeropage): OPC ($LL)
                   operand is zeropage address; effective address is the word in (LL, LL + 1).
                   This mode provides zeropage indirection without indexing, similar to
                   "pre-indexed indirect" ('(zero-page,X)') and "post-indexed indirect"
                   ('(zero-page),Y') with the indexing register set to zero. This mode extends
                   accumulator instructions, like ADC, AND, CMP, EOR, LDA, ORA, SBC, STA.
                   absolute indexed indirect, (absolute,X): OPC ($LLHH,X)
                   operand is base address for indirect lookup;
                   effective address is word in ($HHLL + X, $HHLL + 1 + X).
                   This address mode is available for the JMP instruction only. This is similar
                   to an indirect JMP instruction, but the X register is added to the absolute
                   operand before the address lookup.
