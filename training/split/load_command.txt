# COMMODORE 64 - LOAD ["file-name"][,device][,address]: reads program from tape/disk into memory. Defaults: device 1 (cassette) if omitted; disk usually device 8. LOAD closes open files; in direct mode does CLR before reading; in-program LOAD executes new program (chain) without clearing variables. Tape/disk file name matching and behavior, default load address 2048 unless secondary address 1 used to load to original save location. Examples for tape and disk, including LOAD"*",8, and LOAD with address 1 to restore original memory location.

  LOAD


  TYPE: Command

  FORMAT: LOAD["<file-name>"][,<device>][,<address>]



    Action: The LOAD statement reads the contents of a program file from
  tape or disk into memory. That way you can use the information LOADed
  or change the information in some way. The device number is optional,
  but when it is left out the computer will automatically default to 1, the
  cassette unit. The disk unit is normally device number 8. The LOAD closes
  all open files and, if it is used in direct mode, it performs a CLR
  (clear) before reading the program. If LOAD is executed from within a
  program, the program is RUN. This means that you can use LOAD to "chain"
  several programs together. None of the variables are cleared during a
  chain operation.
    If you are using file-name pattern matching, the first file which
  matches the pattern is loaded. The asterisk in quotes by itself ("*")
  causes the first file-name in the disk directory to be loaded. if the
  filename used does not exist or if it is not a program file, the BASIC
  error message ?FILE NOT FOUND occurs.
    When LOADing programs from tape, the <file-name> can be left out, and
  the next program file on the tape will be read. The Commodore 64 will
  blank the screen to the border color after the PLAY key is pressed. When
  the program is found, the screen clears to the background color and the
  "FOUND" message is displayed. When the <C=> key, <CTRL> key, <ARROW LEFT>
  key, or <SPACE BAR> is pressed, the file will be loaded. Programs will
  LOAD starting at memory location 2048 unless a secondary <address> of 1
  is used. If you use the secondary address of 1 this will cause the
  program to LOAD to the memory location from which it was saved.

  EXAMPLES of LOAD Command:


    LOAD                         (Reads the next program on tape)

    LOAD A$                      (Uses the name in A$ to search)

    LOAD"*",8                    (LOADs first program from disk)

    LOAD"",1,1                   (Looks for the first program on
                                  tape, and LOADs it into the same
                                  part of memory that it came from)




    LOAD"STAR TREK"              (LOAD a file from tape)
    PRESS PLAY ON TAPE
    FOUND STAR TREK
    LOADING
    READY.




    LOAD"FUN",8                  (LOAD a file from disk)
    SEARCHING FOR FUN
    LOADING
    READY.




    LOAD"GAME ONE",8,1           (LOAD a file to the specific
    SEARCHING FOR GAME ONE        memory location from which the
    LOADING                       program was saved on the disk)
    READY.
