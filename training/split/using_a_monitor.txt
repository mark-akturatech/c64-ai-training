# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Monitor usage: assemble single instructions with .a address mnemonic, disassemble with .d, run with .g, monitor auto-increments assembly address; typical cartridge monitors (Action Replay, Final Cartridge) supported.

Using a Monitor
The monitor I'll describe here is a pretty standardized one, and the commands described should work on most monitors, like the ones in the Action Replay and Final Cartridge cartridges. There are some exceptions, like S-Mon, and if that's the only monitor you have, you'll have to find out how it works on your own.

To write new code, you type in a line like


.a 1000 lda #$00

What this does is that it assembles the instruction lda #$00 and puts the resulting machine code at the address $1000. You can now simply type the next line of code, as the monitor itself should now give you a line that looks like this:


.a 1002
That is, the monitor itself calculates where you want to put the next instruction, so if you want to type in a whole program, you only have to issue the a command once yourself.

To start a program, you simply jump directly it, using the g command, eg.:


.g 1000
This will jump directly to the address $1000. To look at the code in memory, eg. the code you've already written, use the d command, like this:


.d 1000
This will disassemble the code in memory, starting at $1000. Different monitors will handle this differently, but most monitors should let you scroll through the code, using the cursor keys.

There are lots of more monitor commands, but this isn't a manual for machine code monitors, so I'll leave the rest to you.
