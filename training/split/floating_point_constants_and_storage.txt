# COMMODORE 64 - Floating-point constant format and rules: simple numbers and scientific notation, display of up to nine digits, rounding at tenth digit, storage uses five bytes, calculations have ten places of accuracy but print rounded to nine digits, valid display range (-999999999..+999999999 shown simply), and behavior when exceeding range.

  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
  |  NOTE: Do NOT put commas inside any number. For example, always type  |
  |  32,000 as 32000. If you put a comma in the middle of a number you    |
  | will get the BASIC error message ?SYNTAX ERROR.                       |

    Floating-point constants are positive or negative numbers and can
  contain fractions. Fractional parts of a number may be shown using a
  decimal point. Once again remember that commas are NOT used between
  numbers. If the plus sign (+) is left off the front of a number, the
  Commodore 64 assumes that the number is positive. If you leave off the
  decimal point the computer will assume that it follows the last digit of
  the number. And as with integers, zeros that come before a constant
  are ignored. Floating-point constants can be used in two ways:

    1) SIMPLE NUMBER
    2) SCIENTIFIC NOTATION

    Floating-point constants will show you up to nine digits on your
  screen. These digits can represent values between -999999999. and
  +999999999. If you enter more than nine digits the number will be
  rounded based on the tenth digit. if the tenth digit is greater than or
  equal to 5 the number will be rounded upward. Less than 5 the number
  be rounded downward. This could be important to the final totals of
  some numbers you may want to work with.
    Floating-point numbers are stored (using five bytes of memory) and
  are manipulated in calculations with ten places of accuracy. However,
