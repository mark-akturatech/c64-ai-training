# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Wrapper at $FFCC that JMPs ($0322) to close input and output channels. If serial channels are open sends UNTALK/UNLISTEN appropriately and resets I/O channels to defaults.

                                *** close input and output channels
                                this routine is called to clear all open channels and restore the I/O channels to
                                their original default values. It is usually called after opening other I/O
                                channels and using them for input/output operations. The default input device is
                                0, the keyboard. The default output device is 3, the screen.
                                If one of the channels to be closed is to the serial port, an UNTALK signal is sent
                                first to clear the input channel or an UNLISTEN is sent to clear the output channel.
                                By not calling this routine and leaving listener(s) active on the serial bus,
                                several devices can receive the same data from the VIC at the same time. One way to
                                take advantage of this would be to command the printer to TALK and the disk to
                                LISTEN. This would allow direct printing of a disk file.
