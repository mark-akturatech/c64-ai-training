# Kick Assembler - Macro plugin interface: public interface IMacro extends IPlugin { MacroDefinition getDefinition(); byte[] execute(IValue[] parameters, IEngine engine); }. MacroDefinition holds plugin properties such as name (getName()/setName()). Macros return assembled bytes as a byte array. Macro plugins are exemplified in Quick Example section.


Recall the format of the .disk directive to understand the definition properties:
.disk WRITERNAME [...DISK PARAMETERS..] {
[..FILE1 PARAMETERS..],
