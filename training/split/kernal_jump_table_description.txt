# ********* - Description of the Kernal jump table area ($FF81-$FFF5 / 65409-65525). Each 3-byte entry is a JMP instruction and an address; programs should call through these stable entry points to be robust across OS/ROM revisions. The first 15 entries ($FFC0-$FFEA / 65472-65514) are consistent across Commodore machines. Some routines are also vectored through the RAM vector table at $0314-$031A (788-794) which can be changed in RAM.

Location Range: 65409-65525 ($FF81-$FFF5)
Kernal Jump Table

The following jump table is provided by Commodore in an effort to
maintain stable entry points for key I/O routines.  Each three-byte
table entry consists of a 6510 JMP instruction and the actual address
of the routine in the ROM.  Although the actual address of the routine
may vary from machine to machine, or in later versions of the Kernal,
these addresses will stay where they are.  By jumping to the entry
point provided by this table, rather than directly into the ROM, you
insure your programs against changes in the Operating System.  In
addition, this jump table may help you write programs that will
function on more than one Commodore machine.  The 15 table entries
from 65472-65514 ($FFC0-$FFEA) are the same for all Commodore
machines, from the earliest PET on.

As an additional aid, some of these routines are also vectored through
the table which starts at 788 ($314).  Since this table is in RAM, you
can change those vectors to point to your own routines which support
additional I/O devices.  Programs that use the jump table entry points
to the I/O routines will be able to use these I/O devices without a
problem.

The following table will give the entry point, routine name, RAM
vector if any, its current address, and a brief summary of its
function.
