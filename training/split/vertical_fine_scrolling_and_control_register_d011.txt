Light Pen Horizontal Position

This location holds the horizontal position of the light pen.  Since
there are only eight bits available (which give a range of 256 values)
for 320 possible horizontal screen positions, the value here is
accurate only to every second dot position.  The number here will
range from 0 to 160 and must be multiplied by 2 in order to get a
close approximation of the actual horizontal dot position of the light
pen.

53268         $D014          LPENY
Light Pen Vertical Position

This location holds the vertical position of the light pen.  Since
there are only 200 visible scan lines on the screen, the value in this
register corresponds exactly to the current raster scan line.

Sprite Enable Register

Bit 0:  Enable Sprite 0 (1=sprite is on, 0=sprite is off)
Bit 1:  Enable Sprite 1 (1=sprite is on, 0=sprite is off)
Bit 2:  Enable Sprite 2 (1=sprite is on, 0=sprite is off)
Bit 3:  Enable Sprite 3 (1=sprite is on, 0=sprite is off)
Bit 4:  Enable Sprite 4 (1=sprite is on, 0=sprite is off)
Bit 5:  Enable Sprite 5 (1=sprite is on, 0=sprite is off)
Bit 6:  Enable Sprite 6 (1=sprite is on, 0=sprite is off)
Bit 7:  Enable Sprite 7 (1=sprite is on, 0=sprite is off)

In order for any sprite to be displayed, the corresponding bit in this
register must be set to 1 (the default for this location is 0).  Of
course, just setting this bit along will not guarantee that a sprite
will be shown on the screen.  The Sprite Data Pointer must indicate a
data area that holds some values other than 0.  The Sprite Color
Register must also contain a value other than that of the background
color.  In addition, the Sprite Horizontal and Vertical Position
Registers must be set for positions that lie within the visible screen
range in order for a sprite to appear on screen.

Horizontal Fine Scrolling and Control Register

Bits 0-2:  Fine scroll display horizontally by X dot positions (0-7)
Bit 3:  Select a 38-column or 40-column text display (1=40 columns,
  0=38 columns)
Bit 4:  Enable multicolor text or multicolor bitmap mode (1=multicolor on,
  0=multicolor off)
Bit 5:  Video chip reset (0=normal operations, 1=video completely off)
Bits 6-7:  Unused

This is one of the two important multifunction control registers on
the VIC-II chip.  On power-up, it is set to a default value of 8,
which means that the VIC chip Reset line is set for a normal display,
Multicolor Mode is disabled, a 40-column text display is selected, and
no horizontal fine-scroll offset is used.

Bits 0-2.  The first three bits of this chip control vertical fine
scrolling of the screen display.  This feature allows you to smoothly
move the entire text display back and forth, enabling the display area
to act as a window, scrolling over a larger text or character graphics
display.

Since each text character is eight dots wide, moving each character
over one whole character position (known as coarse scrolling) is a
relatively big jump, and the motion looks jerky.  By placing a number
from 1 to 7 into these three bits, you can move the whole screen
display from one to seven dot spaces to the right.

Stepping through values 1 to 7 allows you to smoothly make the
transition from having a character appear at one screen column to
having it appear at the next one over.  To demonstrate this, type in
the following program, LIST, and RUN it.

10 FOR I=1 TO 50:FOR J=0 TO 7
20 POKE 53270,(PEEK(53270)AND248) OR J:NEXT J,I
30 FOR I=1 TO 50:FOR J=7 TO 0 STEP-1
40 POKE 53270,(PEEK(53270)AND248) OR J:NEXT J,I

As you can see, after the display has moved over seven dots, it starts
over at its original position.  In order to continue with the scroll,
you must do a coarse scroll every time the value of the scroll bits
goes from 7 to 0, or from 0 to 7.  This is accomplished by moving each
byte of display data on each line over one position, overwriting the
last character, and introducing a new byte of data on the opposite end
of the screen line to replace it.

Obviously, only a machine language program can move all of these bytes
quickly enough to maintain the effect of smooth motion.  The following
BASIC program, however, will give you an idea of what the combination
of fine and coarse scrolling looks like.

10 POKE 53281,0:PRINT CHR$(5);CHR$(147):FOR I=1 TO 5:PRINT CHR$(17):NEXT
20 FOR I=1 TO 30
30 PRINT TAB(I-1)"{UP}{10 SPACES}{UP}"
40 WAIT53265,128:POKE53270,PEEK(53270)AND248:PRINTTAB(I)"AWAY WE GO"
50 FOR J=1 TO 7
60 POKE 53270,(PEEK(53270)AND248)+J
