# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Wrapper at $FFC0 that JMPs ($031A) to the open logical file vector. OPEN sets up logical file table entries and must be preceded by SETLFS and SETNAM.

                                *** open a logical file
                                this routine is used to open a logical file. Once the logical file is set up it
                                can be used for input/output operations. Most of the I/O KERNAL routines call on
                                this routine to create the logical files to operate on. No arguments need to be
                                set up to use this routine, but both the SETLFS, $FFBA, and SETNAM, $FFBD,
                                KERNAL routines must be called before using this routine.

                                *** close a specified logical file
                                this routine is used to close a logical file after all I/O operations have been
                                completed on that file. This routine is called after the accumulator is loaded
                                with the logical file number to be closed, the same number used when the file was
                                opened using the OPEN routine.

                                *** open channel for input
                                any logical file that has already been opened by the OPEN routine, $FFC0, can be
                                defined as an input channel by this routine. the device on the channel must be an
                                input device or an error will occur and the routine will abort.
                                
                                if you are getting data from anywhere other than the keyboard, this routine must be
                                called before using either the CHRIN routine, $FFCF, or the GETIN routine,
                                $FFE4. if you are getting data from the keyboard and no other input channels are
                                open then the calls to this routine and to the OPEN routine, $FFC0, are not needed.
