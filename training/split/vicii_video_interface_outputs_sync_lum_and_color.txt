# COMMODORE 64 - VIDEO INTERFACE: describes the two separate video output signals from the 6566/6567 — SYNC/LUM and COLOR. SYNC/LUM carries horizontal/vertical sync and luminance, is open-drain and requires a 500 ohm pull-up. COLOR carries chrominance including color burst and pixel color, is open-source and should be terminated with 1000 ohms to ground. Explains that these two signals must be externally mixed and can then drive a monitor or be sent to an RF modulator.

  VIDEO INTERFACE

    The video output signal from the 6566/6567 consists of two signals
  which must be externally mixed together. SYNC/LUM output contains all the
  video data, including horizontal and vertical syncs, as well as the
  luminance information of the video display. SYNC/LUM is open drain,
  requiring an external pull-up of 500 ohms. The COLOR output contains all
  the chrominance information, including the color reference burst and the
  color of all display data. The COLOR output is open source and should be
  terminated with 1000 ohms to ground. After appropriate mixing of these
  two signals, the resulting signal can directly drive a video monitor or
  be fed to a modulator for use with a standard television.
