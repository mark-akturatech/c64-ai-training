# NMOS 6510 - Documents single-byte immediate undocumented opcodes and their semantics: ANC ($0B at 1381 and $2B at 1391), ALR ($4B at 1401), ARR ($6B at 1411), SBX ($CB at 1419), SBC ($EB at 1427). For each it shows the opcode byte, the high-level operation (e.g., A = A & #{imm}, A = (A & #{imm}) / 2, X = A & X - #{imm}, A = A - #{imm}), and the flags affected/observed (lines 1379–1432).
