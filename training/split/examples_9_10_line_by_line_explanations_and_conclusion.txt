# COMMODORE 64 - Line-by-line explanations for EXAMPLE PROGRAM 9 and 10: details of instructions and timing loops, clarifies how bits in register 4 enable sync/ring-mod and how waveforms/gating/timing produce the intended effects. Concludes Chapter 4 with encouragement for experimentation and reference to further resources (e.g., 'Making Music on Your Commodore Computer').

    The effects available through the use of the parameters of your
  Commodore 64's SID chip are numerous and varied. Only through ex-
  perimentation on your own will you fully appreciate the capabilities of
  your machine. The examples in this section of the Programmer's Reference
  Guide merely scratch the surface.
