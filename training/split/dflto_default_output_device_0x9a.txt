# ********* - DFLTO ($9A): default output (CMD) device (default 3 = screen). CHKOUT ($F250) stores the device number for output channels. BASIC calls CHKOUT on PRINT# or CMD and clears the channel after PRINT# completes.

154           $9A            DFLTO
Default Output (CMD) Device (Set to 3 for the Screen)

The default value of this location is 3, which designates the screen
as the current output device.  That value can be changed by the Kernal
routine CHKOUT (62032, $F250), which uses this location to store the
device number of the device whose file it defines as an output
channel.

BASIC calls CHKOUT whenever the command PRINT# or CMD is executed, but
clears the channel after the PRINT# operation has been completed.
