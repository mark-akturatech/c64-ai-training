  DATA CONVERSIONS

    When necessary, the CBM BASIC Interpreter will convert a numeric
  data item from an integer to floating-point. or vice-versa, according to
  the following rules:

    o All arithmetic and relational operations are performed in floating
      point format. Integers are converted to floating-point form for
      evaluation of the expression, and the result is converted back to
      integer. logical operations convert their operands to integers an
      return an integer result.
    o If a numeric variable name of one type is set equal to a numeric
      data item of a different type, the number will be converted and
      stored as the data type declared in the variable name.
    o When a floating-point value is converted to an integer, the frac-
      tional portion is truncated (eliminated) and the integer result is
      less than or equal to the floating-point value. If the result is
