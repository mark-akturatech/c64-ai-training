# COMMODORE 64 - Output to other devices (cassette, printer, disk, modem): use OPEN to create channel, then PRINT# to send characters. The OPEN parameters differ by device. Discusses formatting implications when sending to non-screen devices (e.g., TAB doesn't behave same for printers).

  OUTPUT TO MODEM

    The modem is a simple device that can translate character codes into
  audio pulses and vice-versa, so that computers can communicate over
  telephone lines. The OPEN statement for the modem sets up the parameters
  to match the speed and format of the other computer you are communicating
  with. Two characters can be sent in the string at the end
  of the OPEN statement.
    The bit positions of the first character code determine the baud rate,
  number of data bits, and number of stop bits. The second code is op-
  tional, and its bits specify the parity and duplex of the transmission.
  See the RS-232 section or your VICMODEM manual for specific details on
  this device.

  EXAMPLE of OPEN Statement for Modem:

    OPEN 1,2,0,CHR$(6): REM 300 BAUD
    100 OPEN 2,2,0,CHR$(163) CHR$(112): REM 110 BAUD, ETC.

    Most computers use the American Standard Code for Information In-
  terchange, known as ASCII (pronounced ASK-KEY). This standard set of
  character codes is somewhat different from the codes used in the Com-
  modore 64. When communicating with other computers, the Commodore
  character codes must be translated into their ASCII counterparts. A table
  of standard ASCII codes is included in this book in Appendix C.
    Output to the modem is a fairly uncomplicated task, aside from the need
  for character translation. However, you must know the receiving device
  fairly well, especially when writing programs where your computer "talks"
  to another computer without human intervention. An example of this would
  be a terminal program that automatically types in your account number and
  secret password. To do this successfully, you must carefully count the
  number of characters and RETURN characters. Otherwise, the computer
  receiving the characters won't know what to do with them.

  WORKING WITH CASSETTE TAPE

    Cassette tapes have an almost unlimited capacity for data. The longer
  the tape, the more information it can store. However, tapes are limited
  in time. The more data on the tape, the longer the time it takes to find
  the information.
    The programmer must try to minimize the time factor when working with
  tape storage. One common practice is to read the entire cassette data
  file into RAM, then process it, and then re-write all the data on the
  tape. This allows you to sort, edit, and examine your data. However, this
  limits the size of your files to the amount of available RAM.
    If your data file is larger than the available RAM, it is probably time
  to switch to using the floppy disk. The disk can read data at any
  position on the disk, without needing to read through all the other data.
  You can write data over old data without disturbing the rest of the file.
  That's why the disk is used for all business applications like ledgers
  and mailing lists.
    The PRINT# statement formats data just like the PRINT statement does.
  All punctuation works the same. But remember, you're not working with the
  screen now. The formatting must be done with the INPUT# statement
  constantly in mind.

    Consider the statement PRINT# 1, A$, B$, C$. When used with the screen,
  the commas between the variables provide enough blank space between items
  to format them into columns ten characters wide. On cassette, anywhere
  from 1 to 10 spaces will be added, depending on th length of the strings.
  This wastes space on your tape.
    Even worse is what happens when the INPUT# statement tries to read
  these strings. The statement INPUT# 1, A$, B$, C$ will discover no data
  for B$ and C$. A$ will contain all three variables, plus the spaces be-
  tween them. What happens? Here's a look at the tape file:

    A$="DOG" B$="CAT" C$="TREE"
    PRINT# 1, A$, B$, C$
