# COMMODORE 64 - RING MOD (Bit 2): When set, replaces Oscillator 1's Triangle output with a ring-modulated combination of Oscillators 1 and 3. Describes resulting non-harmonic overtone structures useful for bell/gong sounds and special effects. Notes that the Triangle waveform must be selected and Oscillator 3 must have a non-zero frequency; other Voice 3 parameters do not affect ring modulation audibility.

    RING MOD (Bit 2): The RING MOD bit, when set to a one, replaces the
  Triangle waveform output of Oscillator 1 with a "Ring Modulated"
  combination of Oscillators 1 and 3. Varying the frequency of Oscillator 1
  with respect to Oscillator 3 produces a wide range of non-harmonic
  overtone structures for creating bell or gong sounds and for special ef-
  fects. In order for ring modulation to be audible, the Triangle waveform
  of Oscillator 1 must be selected and Oscillator 3 must be set to some
  frequency other than zero. No other parameters of Voice 3 have any effect
  on ring modulation.
