# Kick Assembler - Chapter 13 intro to Modifiers: plugins that modify assembled bytes before storage (encrypt, pack, crunch). Explains .filemodify MyModifier(25) to modify whole file and .modify MyModifier() { ... } to modify a local block. Gives example using *= and .fill inside .modify block.

RTS and ‘lda #0’ is LDA_IMM. So, to place an rts command at target you write:
lda #RTS
sta target

You get the size of a mnemonic by using the asmCommandSize command
.var rtsSize = asmCommandSize(RTS)
//rtsSize=1
.var ldaSize1 = asmCommandSize(LDA_IMM) //ldaSize1=2
.var ldaSize2 = asmCommandSize(LDA_ABS) //ldaSize2=3
