# byRiclianll - Routine tail: calls JSR $FEOO to re-enable read mode on the floppy controller, sets the FDC/status byte in the accumulator (LDA #$01), and performs a final jump to the error/exit handler at $F969 (JMP $F969). This chunk covers cleanup and transfer to the DOS error handler after the write sequence.
