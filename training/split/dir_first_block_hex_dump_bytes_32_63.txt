# byRiclianll - Continuation of the hex/ASCII dump for the first data block (Track 16, Sector 01). Covers the next group of dump lines containing more token and ASCII sequences, numeric strings, punctuation and short symbolic tokens (examples include runs of zeros/ones, ascii-like fragments such as "10000", numeric separators, and single-byte token representations). This chunk is the middle portion of the overall first-half dump and shows how BASIC/data tokens are laid out in this range.
