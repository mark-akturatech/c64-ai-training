# Architecture of 6502 Microprocessor - Interrupt Disable Flag (I). Set by the SEI instruction to prevent the processor from responding to external interrupts; cleared by CLI to re-enable interrupts.


Interrupt Disable 	I

The interrupt disable flag is set if the program has executed a 'Set Interrupt Disable' (SEI) instruction. While this flag is set the processor will not respond to interrupts from external devices until it is cleared by a 'Clear Interrupt Disable' (CLI) instruction.
