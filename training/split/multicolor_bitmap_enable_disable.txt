# COMMODORE 64 - Explains multi-color bitmap mode: select colors from background color register #0 (screen color), the video matrix (upper/lower nybbles of screen memory), and color memory. Enable multi-color bitmap by setting bit 5 of 53265 ($D011) and bit 4 of 53270 ($D016): example POKEs given (original text contains a typo PEEK(53625)). Disable by clearing those bits with AND masks.

  MULTI-COLOR BET MAP MODE

    Like multi-color mode characters, multi-color bit map mode allows you
  to display up to four different colors in each 8 by 8 section of bit map.
  And as in multi-character mode, there is a sacrifice of horizontal
  resolution (from 320 dots to 160 dots).
    Multi-color bit map mode uses an 8K section of memory for the bit map.
  You select your colors for multi-color bit map mode from (1) the
  background color register 0, (the screen background color), (2) the video
  matrix (the upper 4 bits give one possible color, the lower 4 bits an-
  other), and (3) color memory.
    Multi-color bit mapped mode is turned ON by setting bit 5 of 53265
  ($D011) and bit 4 at location 53270 ($D016) to a 1. The following POKE
  does this:

    POKE 53265,PEEK(53625)OR 32: POKE 53270,PEEK(53270)OR 16
