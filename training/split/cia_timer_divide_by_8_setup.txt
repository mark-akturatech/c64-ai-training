# A Minimal C64 Datasette Program Loader - 6502 assembly to configure CIA timers for pulse measurement: writes to $DD04/$DD05 to set Timer B start, $DD0E to start Timer A, and $DD06/$DD07 to always start Timer B from $FFFF. Registers used: $dd04, $dd05, $dd0e, $dd06, $dd07.

The code configures timer A to count down from 7 to 0, with timer B counting
underruns of timer A. This effectively divides the clock by 8:

    lda #7          ;divide timer b by 8
    ldx #0
    sta $dd04
    stx $dd05
    lda #%00010001
    sta $dd0e       ;start timer a
    dex ; $ff
    stx $dd06       ;always start timer b
    stx $dd07       ;from $ffff
