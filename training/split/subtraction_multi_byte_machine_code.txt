# MACHINE - Explains subtraction as 'upside-down' addition: carry flag role is inverted (an 'inverted borrow'), and before subtraction the carry must be set with SEC. For unsigned overflow detection, verify the carry is set after the subtraction; a clear carry indicates underflow/borrow. Rules: set C with SEC before a multi-byte subtraction, work from low-order byte up using SBC in A (carry links borrows), and check flags when complete (general instruction to check for overflow).
