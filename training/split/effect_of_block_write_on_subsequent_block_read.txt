# byRiclianll - Procedure and result of running the original block-read/Ul program against a diskette rewritten by the B-W demo: change the Ul to a B-R in line 160 and observe that only a number of bytes equal to the buffer-pointer value (e.g., 5) are accessible before EOI is returned; demonstrates why Ul/U2 are preferable to B-R/B-W.


Now  run  the  original  block-read  (Ul)  program  that  we  wrote  using  this  diskette.  Be 
sure  to  change  the  track  in  line  160  from  an  18  to  a  1  as  follows: 

160  PRINT#15, "Ul";2;o;  l;o 

If  all  goes  according  to  our  diabolical  plan,  byte  0  will  contain  a  5  which  is  exactly  where 
our  buffer-pointer  ended  up.  We  arbitrarily  set  it  to  position  6  in  line  220  above  and 
256  bytes  later  it  wraps  around  to  position  5.  (Remember  that  bytes  are  numbered  from 
0  to  255  in  a  buffer  area.) 

Now  change  the  Ul  to  a  B-R  in  line  160  and  run  the  program  again.  This  time,  only 
5  bytes  can  be  accessed  before  an  EOI  signal  is  returned.
