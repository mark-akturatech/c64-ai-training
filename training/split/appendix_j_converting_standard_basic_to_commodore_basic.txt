# COMMODORE 64 - APPENDIX J: Converting BASIC programs from other BASIC dialects to Commodore 64 BASIC. Guidelines: remove explicit string length DIMs (use DIM A$(J) rather than DIM A$(I,J)), use '+' for string concatenation, convert string substring forms (A$(I) or A$(I,J)) to LEFT$/MID$ forms (examples provided), convert multiple assignment forms (LET B=C=0 -> C=0:B=0), replace backslash statement separators with colon (:), and rewrite MAT functions using FOR...NEXT loops.

  CONVERTING STANDARD
  BASIC PROGRAMS TO
  COMMODORE 64 BASIC

    If you have programs written in a BASIC other than Commodore BASIC,
  some minor adjustments may be necessary before running them on the
  Commodore-64. We've included some hints to make the conversion easier.


  String Dimensions

    Delete all statements that are used to declare the length of strings.
  A statement such as DIM A$(I,J), which dimensions a string array for J
  elements of length I, should be converted to the Commodore BASIC
  statement DIM A$(J).
    Some BASICs use a comma or an ampersand for string concatenation. Each
  of these must be changed to a plus sign, which is the Commodore BASIC
  operator for string concatenation.
    In Commodore-64 BASIC, the MID$, RIGHT$, and LEFT$ functions are used
  to take substrings of strings. Forms such as A$(I) to access the Ith
  character in A$, or A$(I,J) to take a substring of A$ from position I to
  J, must be changed as follows:

  Other BASIC     Commodore 64 BASIC

  A$(I)=X$        A$=LEFT$(A$,I-1)+X$+MID$(A$,I+1)
  A$(I,J)=X$      A$=LEFT$(A$,I-1)+X$+MID$(A$,J+1)

  Multiple Assignments

    To set B and C equal to zero, some BASICs allow statements of the form:

  10 LET B=C=0
