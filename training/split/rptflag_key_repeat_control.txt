# ********* - RPTFLAG (location 650, $28A): flag controlling which keys repeat when held. Default 0 (only cursor keys, insert/delete, and space repeat). POKE 128 ($80) makes all keys repeat; POKE 64 ($40) disables repeating entirely.

Flag: Which Keys Will Repeat?

The flag at this location is used to determine whether to continue
printing a character as long as its key is held down, or whether to
wait until the key is let up before allowing it to be printed again.
The default value here is 0, which allows only the cursor movement
keys, insert/delete key, and the space bar to repeat.

POKEing this location with 128 ($80) will make all keys repeating,
while a value of 64 ($40) will disable all keys from repeating.
