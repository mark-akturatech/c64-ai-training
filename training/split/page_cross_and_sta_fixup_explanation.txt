# NMOS 6510 - Explanation of why STA ABX has a fix-up (always takes 5 cycles) while some undocumented store opcodes (SHX/SHY/etc.) lack the fix-up leading to collisions between value and high address byte computation when a page-cross occurs. Explains buffered reads and write timing causing the instability.

• When adding Y to the target address causes a page boundary crossing, the highbyte of the
target address is incremented by one (as expected), and then ANDed with (A & X).
Example:
SHA $7133,Y

;9F 33 71
