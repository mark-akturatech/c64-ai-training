# COMMODORE 64 - Other special reversed characters usable inside quotes: how to embed less-easily-typed special characters by leaving spaces, entering reversed-mode, and typing the keys. Lists specific functions and the reversed-character keys that represent them (SHIFT+RETURN, switch lower/upper case, disable/enable case-switching keys).

  5. Other Special Characters

    There are some other characters that can be PRINTed for special
  functions, although they are not easily available from the keyboard. In
  order to get these into quotes, you must leave empty spaces for them in
  the line, hit <RETURN> or <SHIFT+RETURN>, and go back to the spaces with
  the cursor controls. Now you must hit <RVS ON>, to start typing reversed
  characters, and type the keys shown below:

          Function                    Type               Appears As

    <SHIFT+RETURN>                    <SHIFT+M>
    switch to lower case              <N>
    switch to upper case              <SHIFT+N>
    disable case-switching keys       <H>
    enable case-switching keys        <I>
