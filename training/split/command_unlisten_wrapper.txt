# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Wrapper at $FFAE that JMPs to $EDFE to send an UNLISTEN command on the serial bus (stop devices listening).

                                *** command serial bus to UNLISTEN
                                this routine commands all devices on the serial bus to stop receiving data from
                                the computer. Calling this routine results in an UNLISTEN command being transmitted
                                on the serial bus. Only devices previously commanded to listen will be affected.
                                This routine is normally used after the computer is finished sending data to
                                external devices. Sending the UNLISTEN will command the listening devices to get
                                off the serial bus so it can be used for other purposes.
