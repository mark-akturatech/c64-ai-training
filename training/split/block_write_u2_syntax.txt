# byRiclianll - Block-Write command (U2): writes entire contents of a DOS buffer to a given track & sector on disk. SYNTAX parallels U1: PRINT# file#, "U2"; channel#; drive#; track; sector (alternate colon/comma forms). Example: PRINT#15, "U2";2;0;18;0. The position of the buffer-pointer is irrelevant when executing U2; the entire 256-byte buffer is written.

5.5  Block-Write  Command  (U2| 

The  block-write  command  (U2)  writes  the  data  from  a  DOS  buffer  to  any  given  track 
and  sector  on  a  diskette.  The  format  of  a  block-write  command  (U2)  parallels  that  of 
a  block-read  command  (Ul).  The  format  of  a  block- write  command  (U2)  is: 

SYNTAX: 

PRINT#  ■file#,    "U2";   channel#;   drive#;  track; 
sector 

ALTERNATE: 

PRINT#  -file#, 

sector 
PRINT#  -file*, 

sector " 

EXAMPLE: 

PRINT#15, "U2";2;o; i8;o 

where 

file#  =  the  logical  file  number  of  the  command  channel 

channel*       =  the  secondary  address  of  the  associated  open  statement 
drive*  =  0 

track  =  1  to  35 

sector  =  0  to  the  range  for  a  given  track
