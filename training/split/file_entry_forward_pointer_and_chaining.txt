# byRiclianll - Explains the role of the first two bytes in a directory sector entry (forward pointer pointing to next directory sector). Discusses disk rotation, sector staggering (typically increments of 10; directory staggered by 3) and gives the sector filling sequence for a full directory (lists sequences for sectors 0(BAM), 1,4,7,... etc).

Back  to  our  example: 


.  OO:  12  04  82   11   OO  48  4F  57  HOW 

.  08:  20  54  4F  20  55  53  45  AO  TO  USE 

.  10:  AO  AO  AO  AO  AO  OO  OO  OO   

.  18:  00  00  00  00  00  OO  OD  00   


The  first  byte  in  the  file  entry  is  the  file-type  byte.  In  this  instance  we  see  an  $82.  This 
is  interpreted  by  the  DOS  to  mean  that  the  file  entry  is  a  program.  The  following  table 
outlines  Commodores  file  types.
