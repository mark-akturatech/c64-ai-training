# SID 6581/8580 Sound Interface Device - Programming Guide - Drum kick example: short noise burst followed by low-frequency tone. Sequence: set ADSR for short envelope, set initial freq high and noise+gate for a burst, after 1-2 frames switch to low frequency triangle ($D401/$D404) to simulate kick pitch drop.
