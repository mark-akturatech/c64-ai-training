# Architecture of 6502 Microprocessor - Processor Status Register (P) containing flags: N V - B D I Z C (Negative, Overflow, unused, Break, Decimal, Interrupt Disable, Zero, Carry). Used to indicate operation results. Instructions exist to test, set, clear individual bits and to push/pop the entire flags byte on the stack.

Processor Status Register


N	V	-	B	D	I	Z	C


Also known as the flags register.  Used to indicate the results of an operation.  Each bit in the register signifies a different condition.

Some of the instructions allow you to test the values of various bits, set them, clear them, and push the entire set onto the stack (or pop them off).
