3.1 LOADING PREPACKAGED PROGRAMS

For those of you interested in using only prepackaged programs
available on cartridges, cassette, or disk, here's all you have to do:

Using your disk drive, carefully insert the preprogrammed disk so that
the label on the disk is facing up and is closest to you.  Look for a
little notch on the disk (it might be covered with a little piece of
tape).  If you're inserting the disk properly, the notch will be on
the left side.  Once the disk is inside, close the protective gate by
pushing in on the level. Now type LOAD "PROGRAM NAME", 8 and hit the
RETURN key. The disk will make noise and your screen will say:

 SEARCHING FOR PROGRAM NAME
 LOADING

 READY

When the word READY appears, just type RUN, and your prepackaged
software is ready to use.
