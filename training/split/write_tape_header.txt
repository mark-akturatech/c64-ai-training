# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Start of the write-tape-header routine: saves the selected header type into $9E and calls the helper to get the tape buffer start pointer into the X/Y registers (JSR $F7D0). (This is the entry that prepares the header buffer before the full header-write sequence.)
