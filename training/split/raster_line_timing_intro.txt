# The MOS 6567/6569 video controller (VIC-II) and its application in the Commodore 64 - Introduces VIC raster-line timing: states that the sequence of VIC memory accesses within a raster line is fixed and independent of graphics mode; defines the beginning of a line as the negative edge of the raster IRQ and notes the special-case timing for raster line 0 (IRQ and RASTER increment/reset occur one cycle later in line 0) and the simplifying assumption used here (line 0 defined one cycle before IRQ).

3.6.3. Timing of a raster line
------------------------------

The sequence of VIC memory accesses within a raster line is hard-wired,
independent of the graphics mode and the same for every raster line. The
negative edge of IRQ on a raster interrupt has been used to define the
beginning of a line (this is also the moment in which the RASTER register
is incremented). Raster line 0 is, however, an exception: In this line, IRQ
and incrementing (resp. resetting) of RASTER are performed one cycle later
than in the other lines. But for simplicity we assume equal line lengths
and define the beginning of raster line 0 to be one cycle before the
occurrence of the IRQ.
