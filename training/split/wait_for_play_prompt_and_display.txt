# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - High-level 'WAIT FOR PLAY' routine: queries cassette sense (JSR $F82E), if open displays the prompt 'PRESS PLAY ON TAPE' (via kernel I/O message JSR $F12F), scans for STOP key (JSR $F8D0), and loops until the PLAY switch is closed. When closed displays 'OK' and returns. Uses the cassette-sense helper and display routines.
