# COMMODORE 64 - Introduces the concept of timbre and waveforms, explains that timbre is determined primarily by waveform, and shows a conceptual ASCII illustration of a sinusoidal (sine) wave.

  CHANGING WAVEFORMS

    The tonal quality of a sound is called the timbre. The timbre of a
  sound is determined primarily by its "waveform." If you remember the
  example of throwing a pebble into the water you know that the waves
  ripple evenly across the pond. These waves almost look like the first
  sound wave we're going to talk about, the sinusoidal wave, or sine wave
  for short (shown below).
