# Contents - Visible timing artifacts when changing colors with raster interrupts: because the CPU must finish its current instruction before servicing an interrupt (instructions take 2–6 machine cycles and the beam moves ~3 pixels per cycle), the color transition can smear over about 18 pixels; VIC-II timing inconsistencies can enlarge this area.


You may have noticed that you can see the point 
on the screen where the colors change, and it seems 
to be moving. This occurs because the 
microprocessor must finish the instruction it is cur- 
rently working on before it can process the inter- 
rupt. Since an instruction may take from two to six 
machine cycles to execute, and the electron beam 
travels about three pixels per instruction cycle, the 
color can change in an 18 pixel area. This assumes 
that the VIC II chip is consistent about when it 
notifies the processor about the interrupt. Any tim- 
ing inconsistencies in the VIC II chip enlarges the 
area where the color changes.
