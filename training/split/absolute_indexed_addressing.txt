# MACHINE - Absolute, indexed addressing (absolute,X and absolute,Y) adds index register X or Y to a full absolute address, giving access to a 256-byte range starting at base address. Indexing always increases the address; wrap-around only occurs if address crosses page boundary.

                                                                         :77:

A Range of 256 Addresses:  Absolute, Indexed Mode
-------------------------------------------------

Indexing has already been used in Chapter 2.  We give an absolute address,
and then indicate that the contents of X or Y should be added to this address
to give an effective address.

Indexing is used only for data handling:  it's available for such activities
as load and store, but not for branch or jump.  Many instructions give you a
choice of X or Y as an index register; a few are limited specifically to X or
Y.  Instructions that compare or store X and Y (CPX, CPY, STX, and STY) do
not have absolute, indexed addressing; neither does the BIT instruction.

An instruction using absolute, indexed addressing can reach up to 256
locations.  Registers X and Y may hold values from 0 to 255, so that the
effective address may range from the address given to 255 locations higher.
Indexing always increases the address; there is no such thing as a negative
index when used with an absolute address.  If the address given is above
$FF00, a high value in the index may cause the address to "wrap around" and
generate an effective address in the region of $0000; otherwise, the
effective address is never lower than the instruction address.

We've seen the use of indexing.  An instruction can reference a certain
address, then, as the program loops or as the need for information changes,
the same instruction can reference the contents of a different address.  The
maximum range of 256 locations is an important limitation.
