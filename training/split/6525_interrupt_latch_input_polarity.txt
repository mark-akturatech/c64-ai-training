# MACHINE - Behavior of the 6525 Tri-port interface interrupt latches with respect to input polarity and the Interrupt Enable bits. Explains that I4 and I3 latches are set on negative transitions when IE4/IE3=0 and on positive transitions when IE4/IE3=1; all other latches (I2,I1,I0) are set on negative transitions.

If IE4 (IE3) = 0 then I4 (I3) latch will be set on a negative transition of
I4 (I3) input.

If IE4 (IE3) = 1 then I4 (I3) latch will be set on a positive transition of
I4 (I3) input.

All other interrupt latches (I2, I1, I0) are set on a negative transition of
the corresponding interrupt input.
