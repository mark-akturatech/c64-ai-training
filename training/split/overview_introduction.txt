# ca65 Users Guide - Short introduction to ca65: purpose, supported CPUs (6502/65C02/65816), relation to cc65, and origin notes.

ca65 is a powerful macro assembler for the 6502, 65C02, and 65816 CPUs. It is used as a companion assembler for the cc65 crosscompiler, but it may also be used as a standalone product.

1. Overview
ca65 is a replacement for the ra65 assembler that was part of the cc65 C compiler, originally developed by John R. Dunning. I had some problems with ra65 and the copyright does not permit some things which I wanted to be possible, so I decided to write a completely new assembler/linker/archiver suite for the cc65 compiler. ca65 is part of this suite.

Some parts of the assembler (code generation and some routines for symbol table handling) are taken from an older crossassembler named a816 written by me a long time ago.
