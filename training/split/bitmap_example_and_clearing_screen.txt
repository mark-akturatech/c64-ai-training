# COMMODORE 64 - Example BASIC lines to set BASE and enable bitmap (BASE=2*4096; POKE 53272,PEEK(53272)OR8; POKE 53265,PEEK(53265)OR32). Shows how to clear the bitmap memory region with FOR I=BASE TO BASE+7999:POKE I,0:NEXT and set colors for screen memory (FOR I=1024 TO 2023:POKE I,3:NEXT).

  EXAMPLE: Type the following:


  5 BASE=2*4096:POKE53272,PEEK(53272)OR8:REM PUT BIT MAP AT 8192
  10 POKE53265,PEEK(53265)OR32:REM ENTER BIT MAP MODE


  Now RUN the program.
    Garbage appears on the screen, right? Just like the normal screen mode,
  you have to clear the HIGH-RESOLUTION (HI-RES) screen before you use it.
  Unfortunately, printing a CLR won't work in this case. Instead you have
  to clear out the section of memory that you're using for your
  programmable characters. Hit the <RUN/STOP> and <RESTORE> keys, then add
  the following lines to your program to clear the HI-RES screen:



  20 FORI=BASETOBASE+7999:POKEI,0:NEXT:REM CLEAR BIT
  30 FORI=1024TO2023:POKEI,3:NEXT:REM SET COLOR TO CYAN AND BLACK
