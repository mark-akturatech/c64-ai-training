# ********* - OLDTXT ($3D-$3E) stores the address (pointer) of the text of the BASIC statement currently being executed (value of TXTPTR saved at each new statement). END, STOP and BREAK save TXTPTR here and CONT restores it. CONT will fail to continue if OLDTXT is zeroed by LOAD, program modification, or error routines.

61-62         $3D-$3E        OLDTXT
Pointer to the Address of the Current BASIC Statement

This location contains the address (not the line number) of the text
of the BASIC statement that is being executed.  The value of TXTPTR
(122, $7A), the pointer tot he address of the BASIC text character
currently being scanned, is stored here each time a new BASIC line
begins execution.

END, STOP, and the STOP-key BREAK save the value of TXTPTR here, and
CONT restores this value to TXTPTR.  CONT will not continue if 62
($3E) has been changed to a zero by a LOAD, a modification to the
program text, or by error routines.

- "curlin_current_basic_line_number" which expands on CURLIN and OLDTXT together identify the current statement and its line number
- "datptr_pointer_to_current_data_item_and_sample_program" which expands on DATPTR also points into BASIC text area for DATA items (contrast: OLDTXT points to executing statement text)
