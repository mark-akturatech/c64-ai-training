# MACHINE - Appendix A heading and note on 6502 family differences: 6502 uses addresses $00/$01 as normal memory; 6510/7501 use $00 as directional register and $01 as I/O (cassette/memory control); 6509 uses $00 to switch program bank and $01 to switch bank for (..),Y addressing.

                                                         6510/6509/
                                                               7501

The four chips differ only in their use of addresses 0 and 1:

  On the 6502, the addresses are normal memory.

  On the 6510 and 7501, address 0 is a directional register and address 1 is
  an input/output register, used for such things as cassette tape and memory
  control.

  On the 6509, address 0 is used to switch program execution to a new memory
  bank; address 1 is used to switch the memory bank accessed by the two
  instructions LDA (..),Y and STA (..),Y.
