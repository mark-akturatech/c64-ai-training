the top left of the video display, as in Figure 1).  Subsequent memory
addresses are generated by the 6545-1 as a result of CCLK input pulses.
Scrolling of the display is accomplished by changing R12 and R13 to the
memory address associated with the first character of the desired line of
text to be displayed first.  Entire pages of text may be scrolled or changed
as well via R12 and R13.


Cursor Position High (R14) and Low (R15)
----------------------------------------

These registers together comprise a 14-bit register whose contents is the
memory address of the current cursor position.  When the video display scan
counter (MA lines) matches the contents of this register, and when the scan
line counter (RA lines) falls within the bounds set by R10 and R11, then the
CURSOR output becomes active.  Bit 5 of the Mode Control Register (R8) may be
used to delay the CURSOR output by a full CCLK time to accommodate slow
access memories.


LPEN High (R16) and Low (R17)
-----------------------------

These registers together comprise a 14-bit register whose contents is the
light pen strobe position, in terms of the video display address at which the
strobe occurred.  When the LPEN input changes from low to high, then, on the
next negative-going edge of CCLK, the contents of the internal scan counter
is stored in registers R16 and R17.
