# ********* - SETMSG routine: controls Kernal printing of control messages and error messages via bits in the message control flag. Bit 6 controls general Kernal control messages (SEARCHING FOR, LOADING, etc.); Bit 7 controls Kernal error messages. Describes which messages are suppressed or printed and notes BASIC's separate message handling.

65048         $FE18          SETMSG
Set the Message Control Flag

This documented Kernal routine can be entered through its jump table
vector at 65424 ($FF90).

The routine controls the printing of error messages and control
messages by the Kernal.  It Bit 6 is seto to 1 (bit value of 64),
Kernal control messages can be printed.  These messages include
SEARCHING FOR, LOADING, and the like.  If Bit 6 is cleared to 0, these
messages will not be printed (BASIC will clear this bit when a program
is running so that the messages do not appear when I/O is performed
from a program).  Setting Bit 6 will not suppress the PRESS PLAY ON
TAPE or PRESS PLAY & RECORD messages, however.

If Bit 7 is set to 1 (bit value of 128), Kernal error messages can be
printed.  If Bit 7 is set to 0, those error messages (for example, I/O
ERROR #nn) will be suppressed.  Note that BASIC has its own set of
error messages (such as FILE NOT FOUND ERROR) which it uses in
preference to the Kernal's message.
