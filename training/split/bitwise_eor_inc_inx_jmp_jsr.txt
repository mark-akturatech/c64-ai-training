# 6502 Instruction Set - EOR (exclusive OR) opcode summaries across addressing modes. INC, INX, INY instruction details with opcodes and cycles. JMP absolute and JMP indirect behavior and cycle counts (including NMOS indirect bug note). JSR (Jump to Subroutine) details including stack push sequence and timing. LDA introductory line begins at the end of this chunk.
