# COMMODORE 64 - CLOCK OUT (PH0): describes the Phase 0 1-MHz clock output provided by the VIC-II for use as the 65XX processor Phase 0. Explains that system bus activity is referenced to this clock and that it is generated by dividing the 8-MHz video input clock by eight.

  CLOCK OUT (PH0)

    The clock output, Phase 0, is the 1-MHz clock used as the 65XX pro-
  cessor Phase 0 in. All system bus activity is referenced to this clock.
  The clock frequency is generated by dividing the 8-MHz video input clock
  by eight.
