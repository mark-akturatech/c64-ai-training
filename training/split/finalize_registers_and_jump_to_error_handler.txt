# byRiclianll - Final register updates and termination of the destructive write routine. Loads immediate values into drive control bytes (LDA #*05; STA *31; LDA #*01) then performs a JMP to the error handler at *F969. This finishes the sequence after the write and branches to the routine that handles the 'single sector 23 error' flow.


700  LDA  #*05 

710  STA  *31 

720  LDA  #*01 

730  JMP  *F969
