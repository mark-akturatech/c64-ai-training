# C64 PRG Appendix - Page 2/3 Memory, Vectors



  the effective address must be in page zero.

  INDIRECT INDEXED ADDRESSING - In indirect indexed addressing (referred to
  as [Indirect], Y), the second byte of the instruction points to a memory
  location in page zero. The contents of this memory location is added to
  the contents of the Y index register, the result being the low order
  eight bits of the effective address. The carry from this addition is
  added to the contents of the next page zero memory location, the result
  being the high order eight bits of the effective address.

  ABSOLUTE INDIRECT - The second byte of the instruction contains the low
  order eight bits of a memory location. The high order eight bits of that
  memory location is contained in the third byte of the instruction. The
  contents of the fully specified memory location is the low order byte of
  the effective address. The next memory location contains the high order
  byte of the effective address which is loaded into the sixteen bits of
  the program counter.

  APPLICATIONS NOTES

    Locating the Output Register at the internal I/O Port in Page Zero
  enhances the powerful Zero Page Addressing instructions of the 6510.
    By assigning the I/O Pins as inputs (using the Data Direction Register)
  the user has the ability to change the contents of address 0001 (the
  Output Register) using peripheral devices. The ability to change these
  contents using peripheral inputs, together with Zero Page Indirect
  Addressing instructions, allows novel and versatile programming tech-
  niques not possible earlier.
