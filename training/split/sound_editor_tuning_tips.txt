# Contents - Practical advice for using the Sound Editor: experiment with different register values to learn how they affect sound, adjust play time values to speed up sound polishing, and note that sound values can be determined separately from the main program.

By experimenting with different values in the greatly speed up the time it takes to polish a game, 

registers, you will very quickly get a feel for what as the values for the sounds can be determined 

effect different values have on the sound. Being able separately from the main program, 
to specify the amount of time to play the sound can
