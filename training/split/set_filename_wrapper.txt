# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Wrapper at $FFBD that JMPs to $FDF9 to set the filename (length in A, XY pointer to filename).

                                *** set the filename
                                this routine is used to set up the file name for the OPEN, SAVE, or LOAD routines.
                                The accumulator must be loaded with the length of the file and XY with the pointer
                                to file name, X being th low byte. The address can be any valid memory address in
                                the system where a string of characters for the file name is stored. If no file
                                name desired the accumulator must be set to 0, representing a zero file length,
                                in that case  XY may be set to any memory address.
