# 6502 Multiplication and Division Algorithms - Source: llx.com - Important caveat on widths: quotient must be as wide as the dividend (e.g., dividing by 1 yields quotient equal to dividend), and remainder must be as wide as the divisor (can be as large as divisor-1). Warns against assuming dividing an N-byte dividend by a smaller divisor produces a proportionally smaller quotient. Notes that additional size-specific routines are straightforward to write.

Beware!  Since multiplying two one-byte numbers gives you a two-byte
result, the knee-jerk expectation is that dividing a two-byte number by
a one-byte number should give you a one-byte quotient.  This turns out not
to be true!  When dividing two numbers, the quotient must be as wide as
the dividend (consider dividing by 1, in which case the quotient is
the dividend), and the remainder must be as wide as the divisor (because it
can be as large as divisor-1).


Again, I'm not going to bloat this article by showing division
routines for different sizes of numbers.  Once the method is
understood, writing additional routines is straightforward.
