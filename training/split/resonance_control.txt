# SID 6581/8580 Sound Interface Device - Programming Guide - Resonance bits 7-4 of $D417 (0-15). Resonance emphasizes frequencies at cutoff; high values create pronounced peaks and on 6581 can self-oscillate (used as a crude fourth oscillator); 8580 less prone to self-oscillation.

7.3 RESONANCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bits 7-4 of register $D417 control the resonance amount (0-15).

Resonance emphasizes frequencies at the cutoff point, creating a peak in the
frequency response curve. Higher resonance values produce a more pronounced
peak:
  0:  No resonance - flat response through filter
  8:  Moderate resonance - noticeable emphasis
  15: Maximum resonance - strong peak, self-oscillation possible on 6581

On the 6581, high resonance settings can cause the filter to self-oscillate,
producing a sine-like tone at the cutoff frequency even without any voice
input. This can be used as a crude fourth oscillator.

On the 8580, self-oscillation is harder to achieve due to different filter
characteristics.
