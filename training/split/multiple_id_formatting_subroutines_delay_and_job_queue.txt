# byRiclianll - Utility subroutines used by the formatter: REM DELAY (lines 900-950) which prompts the user to press Return, loops on GETC* to wait for CR, prints OK and returns; and a second REM JOB QUEUE (lines 960 onward) that initializes TRY, composes M-W job packets (CHR$ values including job and track parameters), increments TRY, sends M-R to poll for response, reads GET#15 response E$ (normalizing empty responses), converts to numeric E=ASC(E$), includes retry timeout handling (IF TRY=500 GOTO 1070) and conditional branching on response values. This chunk contains the I/O-wait and job-queue logic used by the multiple-ID formatter; it ends mid-sequence at the document boundary.
