# MACHINE - B-series computers (B-128, B-256, CBM-128/256) overview: use 6509 CPU with bank-switched memory; different zero page; cassette buffer location moved; more complex bank-switching requiring transfer sequences and bootstraps; built-in monitor with new commands (.V .@). Advises beginners to consider simpler models.



B Series
--------

The B-128, B-256, CBM-128, and CBM-256 were designed as successors to the
80-column PET/CBM units.  Architecture has been radically changed:  the
processor is a 6509, memory is bank switched, and zero page is significantly
different from that of other models.

The cassette buffer is no longer at $0330, so that the examples given in this
book will need to be moved to a new part of RAM (addresses $0400 to $07FF are
available).  Bank switching is more complex than on other models.  Beginners
will find that there are more things to be kept track of in this machine.  If
possible, beginners should try to find a simpler computer on which to take
their first steps.

                                                                        :159:

Implementation of large-scale programs require setting up a "transfer
sequence" program to link the program's memory bank to that of the kernal.
Usually, a bootstrap program will be needed to set everything up.

A machine language monitor is built into this line of machines.  A few new
commands have been made available:  .V to switch banks, .@ to test disk
status.
