# CIA 6526 Complex Interface Adapter - Comprehensive Reference - Quick-reference of how the C64 KERNAL uses the CIAs: CIA1 Timer A used by KERNAL for system IRQ (~60 Hz) with default timer values ($4025 PAL, $4295 NTSC) driving cursor blink, keyboard scan and periodic tasks. CIA1 Timer B available to user programs and used by BASIC for TI/TI$ when combined with Timer A. CIA1 TOD used by BASIC for TI/TI$ variables. CIA2 timers/TOD used by KERNAL for RS-232 timing and available for user programs.

13. QUICK REFERENCE - C64 KERNAL CIA USAGE
=============================================================

The C64 KERNAL uses the CIAs as follows:

CIA 1 Timer A:
  Used by the KERNAL for the system IRQ (default ~60 Hz).
  Default timer value: $4025 (16421) for PAL,
                       $4295 (17045) for NTSC.
  This generates the cursor blink, keyboard scan, and
  other periodic system tasks.

CIA 1 Timer B:
  Available for user programs. Used by BASIC for the
  TI/TI$ (jiffy clock) when combined with Timer A.

CIA 1 TOD:
  Used by BASIC for the TI/TI$ real-time clock variables.

CIA 2 Timers/TOD:
  Used by the KERNAL for RS-232 bit timing and available
  for user programs.
