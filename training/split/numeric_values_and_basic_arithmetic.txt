# Kick Assembler - Overview of numeric values (integers and floats) and standard arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /). Covers operator precedence, short inline examples (25+3, 5+2.5*3-10/2, charmem + y * $100) and a practical assembler example showing .var charmem = $0400 and a small loop that uses arithmetic to compute addresses (sta charmem + n*$100,x).

4.4. Numeric Values
Numeric values are numbers, covering both integers and floats. Standard numerical operators (+,-,*, and /) work
as in standard programming languages. You can combine them with each other and they will obey the standard
precedence rules. Here are some examples:
25+3
5+2.5*3-10/2
charmem + y * $100

In practical use they can look like this:
.var charmem = $0400
ldx #0
lda #0
loop:
sta charmem + 0*$100,x
sta charmem + 1*$100,x
sta charmem + 2*$100,x
sta charmem + 3*$100,x
inx
bne loop
