# 6502 Multiplication and Division Algorithms - Source: llx.com - Notes the limitation of the constant-multiplication techniques when both multiplicand and multiplier are unknown at runtime and points out the need for a general multiply-anything-by-anything routine in that case.



But what if you need to multiply two numbers, and you don't know what
either one is in advance?  In this case, you need a general
multiply-anything-by-anything routine.
