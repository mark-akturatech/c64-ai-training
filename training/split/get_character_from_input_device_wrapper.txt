# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Wrapper at $FFE4 that JMPs ($032A) to get a character from the input device (GETIN). For keyboard this behaves like CHRIN but returns 0 if buffer empty.

                                *** get character from input device
                                in practice this routine operates identically to the CHRIN routine, $FFCF,
                                for all devices except for the keyboard. If the keyboard is the current input
                                device this routine will get one character from the keyboard buffer. It depends
                                on the IRQ routine to read the keyboard and put characters into the buffer.
                                If the keyboard buffer is empty the value returned in the accumulator will be zero.
