# byRiclianll - Notes that the textual directory displayed on-screen is not necessarily the same as how directory information is stored on the disk. Introduces the Block Availability Map (BAM) as the next topic to examine the disk's actual allocation map.

What  you  see  on  your  screen  is  not  necessarily  how  the  directory  is  stored  on  your 
diskette,  however.  Let's  begin  our  look  at  the  directory  with  the  Block  Availability  Map 
(BAM).

- "example_directory_listing_output" which expands on the displayed listing whose on-disk representation will be explored via the BAM
