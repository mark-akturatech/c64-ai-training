# The MOS 6567/6569 video controller (VIC-II) and its application in the Commodore 64 - Explains the meaning of the diagram lines and symbols: 'Cycl-#' (clock cycle counts per raster line and variant-specific lengths: 63 cycles on 6569, 64 on 6567R56A, 65 on 6567R8), the included previous/next-line cycles, the bus signals lines ('�0', 'IRQ', 'BA', 'AEC') and their phase meaning, the VIC and 6510 access-type symbols (c, g, 0-7, s, r, i) and CPU markers (x, X) with full definitions, and the 'Graph.' and 'X coo.' projection notes (how the 40-column display projection relates to sprite positioning and that the visible border on actual video is generated ~8 pixels later than shown).



The line "Cycl-#" show the number of the clock cycle within the raster
line. The line starts with cycle 1 and consists of 63 cycles on the 6569,
of 64 cycles on the 6567R56A and of 65 cycles on the 6567R8. The last cycle
of the previous line and the first cycle of the next line have also been
included in the diagrams to make things clearer.

The lines "�0", "IRQ", "BA" and "AEC" reflect the state of the bus signals
with the same names. �0 is low in the first phase and high in the second
phase.

The symbols in the lines "VIC" and "6510" show what kind of access VIC and
6510 do in the corresponding clock phase (for an explanation of the
different access types of the VIC see section 3.6.2.):

  c  Access to video matrix and Color RAM (c-access)
  g  Access to character generator or bitmap (g-access)
 0-7 Reading the sprite data pointer for sprite 0-7 (p-access)
  s  Reading the sprite data (s-access)
  r  DRAM refresh
  i  Idle access

  x  Read or write access of the processor
  X  Processor may do write accesses, stops on first read (BA is low and so
     is RDY)

The line "X coo." contains the X coordinates of the beginning of each clock
phase (thus the "\\\" as a reminder) and the line "Graph." is a projection
of the 40 column display window and the border to these coordinates, for
positioning sprites. However, this doesn't correspond to the signal on the
VIC video output. Also you cannot see from the "Graph." line when the
border unit generates the border. This happens approx. 8 pixels later than
shown in the "Graph." line.
