# 6502 Instruction Set - Rev. A 6502 'ROR bug' detailed: chips made before June 1976 lacked control lines for ROR; ROR behaves like ASL without updating carry; N and Z flags set correctly. Provides opcode/opcycle table for ROR on Rev A and historical note about implementation change in Rev B (reportedly due to user demand).

          Note: The operand of instructions like "ASL A" is often depicted as implied, as well.
          Mind that, for any practical reasons, the two notations are interchangeable for any
          instructions involving the accumulator. — However, there are subtle differences.

          Finally, a more complex view, the instruction set listed by rows as
          combinations of a and c, and b in columns:
          Address modes are either a property of b (even columns) or combinations
          of b and c (odd columns with aspecific row-index modulus 3; i.e., every
                                                                   6502 Instruction Set
          third row in a given column). In those latter columns, first and third
          rows (c = 0 and c = 2) refer to the same kind of general operation.
          Load, store and transfer instructions as well as comparisons are typically
          found in the lower half of the table, while most of the arithmetical and
          logical operations as well as stack and jump instructions are found in the
          upper half. (However, mind the exception of SBC as a "mirror" of ADC.)
