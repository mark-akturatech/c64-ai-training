# NMOS 6510 - Undocumented absolute and absolute,X NOPs (TOP, SKW, IGN): $0C (NOP abs) and the absolute,X group $1C, $3C, $5C, $7C, $DC, $FC (NOP abs, x). $0C uses absolute addressing: the two bytes following form the absolute address; size = 3 bytes, cycles = 4. The abs,X variants use absolute indexed X addressing: size = 3 bytes, cycles = 4 (increased by +1 cycle when a page boundary is crossed). Operation note: these opcodes perform a memory read from the computed address; the read value is discarded. Test file references for validation are listed (Lorenz test programs).

Operation: These actually perform a read operation. It's just that the value read is not stored in any
register. Further, opcode $0C uses the absolute addressing mode. The two bytes which follow it
form the absolute address. All the other 3 byte NOP opcodes use the absolute indexed X addressing
mode. If a page boundary is crossed, the execution time of one of these NOP opcodes is upped to 5
clock cycles.
