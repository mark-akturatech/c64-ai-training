# Kick Assembler - Introduction to .pseudocommand: syntax for defining pseudo commands that accept mnemonic-style arguments. Example mov pseudo command definition and usage examples (immediate, label, indexed, and indirect,y forms) with comments illustrating generated mnemonics.

7.3. Pseudo Commands
Pseudo commands are a special kind of macros that take command arguments, like #20, table,y or ($30),y as
arguments just like mnemonics do. With these you can make your own extended commands. Here is an example
of a mov command that moves a byte from one place to another:
.pseudocommand mov src:tar {
lda src
sta tar
}

You use the mov command like this:
mov #10 : $1000
mov source : target
mov source,x : target,y
mov #20 : ($30),y

// Sets $1000 to 10 (lda #10, sta $1000)
// target = source
(lda source, sta target)
// (lda source,x , sta target,y)
// (lda #20, sta ($30),y )
