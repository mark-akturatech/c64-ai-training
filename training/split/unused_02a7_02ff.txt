# - C64 RAM Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $02A7-$02FF: unused RAM area (free for machine language subroutines or graphics data). Mentions this area is useful for sprite or character data when VIC-II uses bottom 16K (default), e.g., locations 704-767 usable for sprite block 11.

$02A7-$02FF          Unused
                     
                     The programmer may use this area for machine language subroutines, or
                     for graphics data storage.
                     
                     If the VIC-II ship is using the bottom 16K for graphics and memory
                     (the default setting when the system is turned on), this is one of the
                     few free areas available for storing sprite or character data.
                     Locations 704-767 could be used for sprite data block number 11,
                     without interfering with BASIC program text or variables.
