# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - START TIMER: Starts CIA#1 timer A and configures CIA#1 control registers to enable IRQ when timer B reaches zero. Sets $DC0D to enable IRQ on timer B, forces load of timer A values by setting bits in $DC0E and jumps to serial clock-off routine at $EE8E to continue serial handling.
