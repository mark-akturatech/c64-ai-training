# COMMODORE 64 - KERNAL routine LISTEN: purpose (command a device on the serial bus to listen), call address ($FFB1), communication register (A), description of operation (accumulator contains device number 0–31, converts to listen address and transmits on serial bus), step-by-step usage and a short example commanding device #8 to listen.

  B-14. Function Name: LISTEN

    Purpose: Command a device on the serial bus to listen
    Call Address: $FFB1 (hex) 65457 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns: See READST
    Stack requirements: None
    Registers affected: A

    Description: This routine will command a device on the serial bus to
  receive data. The accumulator must be loaded with a device number between
  0 and 31 before calling the routine. LISTEN will OR the number bit by bit
  to convert to a listen address, then transmits this data as a command on
  the serial bus. The specified device will then go into listen mode, and
  be ready to accept information.

  How to Use:
    1) Load the accumulator with the number of the device to command
       to LISTEN.
    2) Call this routine using the JSR instruction.

  EXAMPLE:
    ;COMMAND DEVICE #8 TO LISTEN
    LDA #8
    JSR LISTEN
