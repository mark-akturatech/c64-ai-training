# Contents - Design advice: avoid deterministic play by adding random elements so games remain unpredictable; consider the hardware capabilities of the C64 during design to avoid attempting impossible displays; use the programming techniques from the book (e.g., sprite multiplexing) to extend possibilities.

boring. This can be caused by a number of factors. 
More often than not, the game idea was good, but 
the computer lacked the ability to display a game 
as complex as you wanted. 

One thing to beware of when designing a game, 
is the tendency to have the game play in exacdy the 
same way each time it is played. If there are no ran- 
dom elements in the game, each move by the player 
will cause a specific move by the computer. This 
may be challenging at first, but will quickly become 
boring once it is mastered. The PAC-MAN arcade 
machine had this problem and it didn't take long 
before patterns that showed how to beat the 
machine every time were published. All it takes is 
an occasional random move for the play to be 
unpredictable — which will add to the challenge of 
the game. 

After you have spent some time programming 
the Commodore 64, you will have a good idea of 
what it is capable of doing. If you take into account 
the capabilities of the computer during the design 
phase of your program, you will have a much easier
