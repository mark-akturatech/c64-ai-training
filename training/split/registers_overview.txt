# Architecture of 6502 Microprocessor - Overview of the 6502 register set: six registers total — five 8-bit registers (A accumulator, X and Y index registers, S stack pointer, P processor status) and one 16-bit register (Program Counter, PCH/PCL).

Registers

The 6502 only has 6 registers.  Five are 8 bits wide, one is 16 bits wide.

	A		Accumulator
			
	X		Index Register X
			
	Y		Index Register Y
			
PCH	PCL		Program Counter
			
	S		Stack Pointer
			
	P		Processor Status  (Flags)
