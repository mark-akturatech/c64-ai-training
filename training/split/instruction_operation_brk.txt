# 6502 Microprocessor - BRK pseudocode: increment PC, push return address (high/low) and status onto stack, set break and interrupt flags, load PC from IRQ vector ($FFFE/$FFFF).

/* BRK */
    PC++;
    PUSH((PC >> 8) & 0xff);	/* Push return address onto the stack. */
    PUSH(PC & 0xff);
    SET_BREAK((1));             /* Set BFlag before pushing */
    PUSH(SR);
    SET_INTERRUPT((1));
    PC = (LOAD(0xFFFE) | (LOAD(0xFFFF) << 8));
