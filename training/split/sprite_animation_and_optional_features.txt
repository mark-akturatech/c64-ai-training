# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Animation by changing position registers or changing Sprite Data Pointer to alternate shapes; optional features include X/Y expand registers (double width/height), collision detection registers, priority register for sprite vs foreground, and per-sprite multicolor via $D01C plus shared multicolor registers $D025-$D026.


                          Once you have the sprite on the screen, animation is fairly simple to
                          achieve.  Moving the sprite is as easy as changing the values in the
                          sprite position registers.  Changing the sprite shape can be
                          accomplished by merely changing the Sprite Data Pointer to point to
                          another block of shape data in memory.

                          There are also some optional sprite graphics features available which
                          enhance its flexibility.  Sprite expand registers allow you to make
                          each sprite twice as wide as normal, twice as tall, or both.
                          Collision detection registers let you know when a sprite shape
                          overlaps a regular text character or bitmap dot, or if two sprites are
                          touching.

                          If a sprite is positioned in the same place on the screen as a text
                          character or bitmap dot, a Priority Register allows you to choose
                          whether the sprite or the normal graphics will be displayed.  This
                          enables three- dimensional effects by letting you choose whether the
                          sprite goes in front of or behind other objects on the screen.

                          Finally, any sprite may be selected for multicolor display, using the
                          register at location 53276 ($D01C).  In this mode, as in multicolor
                          text and bitmap modes, pairs of bits are used to determine the color
                          of each double- width dot.  The possible color values which may be
                          selected are those of Background Color Register 0, the Sprite Color
                          Register, or the two color values in the Sprite Multicolor Registers
                          at 53285-53286 ($D025-$D026).
