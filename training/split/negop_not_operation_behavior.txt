# ********* - NEGOP — implement NOT and '>' behavior for floating point accumulator. Describes negation of FAC1 by XORing the sign byte with $FF, leaving zero unchanged, and explains result semantics based on NOT X = -(X+1) (e.g., NOT true (-1) gives 0).

49076         $BFB4          NEGOP
Perform NOT and >

This negates the Floating Point Accumulator by exclusive ORing the
sign byte with a constant of 255 ($FF).  Zero is left unchanged.  The
results of this command follow rom the formula NOT X=-(X+1).
Therefore, if you NOT a tatement that is true (-1), you get 0 (false).
