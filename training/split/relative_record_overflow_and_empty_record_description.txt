# byRiclianll - Describes how a relative-file record spans sectors: bytes 2-131 of track 23, sector 2 are overflow from the previous record; bytes 132-255 of that sector and bytes 2-27 of track 23, sector 12 form the next record. Notes that the next record is empty (first byte = 255 / $FF, remaining bytes null), that track 23 sector 12 has no forward chain and has a byte count of 177 ($B1), and that the last record ends at byte 177 (bytes 28–177). Introduces the following illustration of padding beyond this point.

An  analysis  of  the  preceding  two  sectors  will  all  but  end  our  discussion  on  relative  file 
structure.  Bytes  2-131  of  track  23,  sector  2  are  the  overflow  of  a  previous  record.  Bytes 
132-255  of  this  same  track  and  bytes  2-27  of  track  23,  sector  12  make  up  the  next  record. 
This  record  is  empty,  as  indicated  by  a  255  ($FF)  in  the  first  byte  and  nulls  in  the  re- 
maining bytes.  Track  23,  sector  12  has  no  forward  chain  and  a  byte  count  of  177  ($B1). 
Our  last  record  in  the  relative  file  ends  at  byte  177  (28-177).  What  is  interesting  is  the 
padding  beyond  this  point:
