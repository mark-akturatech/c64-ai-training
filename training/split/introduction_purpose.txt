# COMMODORE 64 - Overview of the Programmer's Reference Guide purpose and intended audience; scope of material (BASIC and 6502 machine language not taught in depth).

  INTRODUCTION

    The COMMODORE 64 PROGRAMMER'S REFERENCE GUIDE has been developed as a
  working tool and reference source for those of you who want to maximize
  your use of the built-in capabilities of your COMMODORE 64. This manual
  contains the information you need for your programs, from the simplest
  example all the way to the most complex. The PROGRAMMER'S REFERENCE GUIDE
  is designed so that everyone from the beginning BASIC programmer to the
  professional experienced in 6502 machine language can get information to
  develop his or her own creative programs. At the same time this book
  shows you how clever your COMMODORE 64 really is.
    This REFERENCE GUIDE is not designed to teach the BASIC programming
  language or the 6502 machine language. There is, however, an extensive
  glossary of terms and a "semi-tutorial" approach to many of the sections
  in the book. If you don't already have a working knowledge of BASIC and
  how to use it to program, we suggest that you study the COMMODORE 64
  USER'S GUIDE that came with your computer. The USER'S GUIDE gives you an
  easy to read introduction to the BASIC programming language. If you still
  have difficulty understanding how to use BASIC then turn to the back of
  this book (or Appendix N in the USER'S GUIDE) and check out the
  Bibliography.
    The COMMODORE 64 PROGRAMMER'S REFERENCE GUIDE is just that; a
  reference. Like most reference books, your ability to apply the
  information creatively really depends on how much knowledge you have
  about the subject. In other words if you are a novice programmer you will
  not be able to use all the facts and figures in this book until you
  expand your current programming knowledge.
