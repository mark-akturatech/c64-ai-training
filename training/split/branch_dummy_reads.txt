# NMOS 6510 - Branch instruction dummy-read behaviour: opcode fetch, read of offset (PC+1), dummy read of PC+2, and additional cycles when branch is taken or crosses page boundaries. Shows per-cycle addresses and conditions for extra dummy reads.

Example: acknowledge VIC-II interrupt

This is probably the most popular usage of the dummy writes. Usually you would have to do
LDA $D019
STA $D019
to acknowledge the VIC-II interrupt. However, you can use any RMW instruction instead, eg
INC $D019

Example: acknowledge and disable timer interrupt
