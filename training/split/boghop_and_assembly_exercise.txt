# Contents - Introduction to the BOGHOP example (Appendix C): the next chapter explains the BOGHOP game's operation; if you're new to assembly, assemble the program as an exercise (work on a copy of the source disk), read comments to find where small changes affect gameplay, and use it to learn assembly language by experimentation.

The next chapter describes in detail the opera- 
tion of the BOGHOP game, which is in Appendix 
C. This game has been designed to demonstrate vir- 
tually all the programming techniques described in 
this book. 

If you have never programmed in assembly 
language, you may wish to try assembling the pro- 
gram as an exercise. Before doing so, you should 
make a copy of the source code disk and only work 
with the copy. The program has been structured in 
such a way that small changes can completely 
change game play. By reading the comments in the 
program listing, you will be able to see where you 
can make changes. This provides you with an easy 
way to start experimenting with an assembly 
language program.
