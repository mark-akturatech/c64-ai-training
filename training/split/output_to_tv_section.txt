# COMMODORE 64 - Output to the TV: Using BASIC PRINT statement to display on screen. Discusses cursor control codes and special functions (TAB, SPC). Mentions character code for RETURN (CHR$ 13) and that control codes affect cursor and screen formatting. Refers to VIC chip and graphics chapter for colors and screen manipulation, and sound chapter for audio.


  OUTPUT TO OTHER DEVICES

    It is often necessary to send output to devices other than the screen,
  like a cassette deck, printer, disk drive, or modem. The OPEN statement
  in BASIC creates a "channel" to talk to one of these devices. Once the
  channel is OPEN, the PRINT# statement will send characters to that
  device.

  EXAMPLE of OPEN and PRINT# Statements:

    100 OPEN 4,4: PRINT# 4, "WRITING ON PRINTER"
    110 OPEN 3,8,3,"0:DISK-FILE,S,W":PRINT#3,"SEND TO DISK"
    120 OPEN 1,1,1,"TAPE-FILE": PRINT#1,"WRITE ON TAPE"
    130 OPEN 2,2,0,CHR$(10):PRINT#2,"SEND TO MODEM"

    The OPEN statement is somewhat different for each device. The pa-
  rameters in the OPEN statement are shown in the table below for each
  device.

  TABLE of OPEN Statement Parameters:

    FORMAT: OPEN file#, device#, number, string

  +--------+---------+---------------------+------------------------------+
  | DEVICE | DEVICE# |       NUMBER        |            STRING            |

  |CASSETTE|    1    | 0 = Input           | File Name                    |
  |        |         | 1 = Output          |                              |
  |        |         | 2 = Output with EOT |                              |
  | MODEM  |    2    | 0                   | Control Registers            |

  OUTPUT TO PRINTER

    The printer is an output device similar to the screen. Your main con-
  cern when sending output to the printer is to create a format that is
  easy on the eyes. Your tools here include reversed, double-width, capital
  and lower case letters, as well as dot-programmable graphics.
    The SPC function works for the printer in the same way it works for the
  screen. However, the TAB function does not work correctly on the printer,
  because it calculates the current position on the line based on the
  cursor's position on the screen, not on the paper.
    The OPEN statement for the printer creates the channel for communi-
  cation. It also specifies which character set will be used, either upper
  case with graphics or upper and lower case.
