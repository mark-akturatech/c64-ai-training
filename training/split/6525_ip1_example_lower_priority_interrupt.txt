# MACHINE - IP = 1 example C: behavior when a lower-priority interrupt occurs during servicing of a higher-priority interrupt. Sequence: I1 is latched and being serviced; during service I0 (lower priority) is latched; upon completion of I1 and writing AIR to clear A1, the latched I0 is transferred to AIR and /IRQ is reasserted, beginning a new interrupt sequence for I0.

C.  The third case occurs when an interrupt has been received and a lower
    priority interrupt occurs.

    1.  Interrupt I1 is received and latched.
    2.  /IRQ is pulled low and A1 is set high.
    3.  Processor recognizes /IRQ and reads AIR to determine that I1
        interrupt occurred.
    4.  Processor logic servicing I1 interrupt during which I0 interrupt
        occurs and is latched.
    5.  Upon completion of I1 interrupt routine the processor writes AIR to
        clear A1 to signal 6525 that interrupt service is complete.
    6.  Latch I0 interrupt is transferred to AIR and /IRQ is pulled low to
        begin new interrupt sequence.
