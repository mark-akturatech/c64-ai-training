# COMMODORE 64 - KERNAL PLOT (call $FFF0 / 65520): set or read cursor location on screen. Uses A,X,Y. With carry set (SEC) reads current cursor location: Y=column (6-39), X=row (0-24). With carry clear (CLC) moves cursor to X,Y using Y as column and X as row. Stack requirement: 2. Example shows moving cursor to row 10, column 5 with LDX #10 ; LDY #5 ; CLC ; JSR PLOT.


  B-19. Function Name: PLOT

    Purpose: Set cursor location
    Call address: $FFF0 (hex) 65520 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A, X, Y
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns: None
    Stack requirements: 2
    Registers affected: A, X, Y

    Description: A call to this routine with the accumulator carry flag
  set loads the current position of the cursor on the screen (in X,Y
  coordinates) into the Y and X registers. Y is the column number of the
  cursor location (6-39), and X is the row number of the location of the
  cursor (0-24). A call with the carry bit clear moves the cursor to X,Y
  as determined by the Y and X registers.

  How to Use:


  READING CURSOR LOCATION

    1) Set the carry flag.
    2) Call this routine.
    3) Get the X and Y position from the Y and X registers, respectively.


  SETTING CURSOR LOCATION

    1) Clear carry flag.
    2) Set the Y and X registers to the desired cursor location.
    3) Call this routine.


  EXAMPLE:

    ;MOVE THE CURSOR TO ROW 10, COLUMN 5 (5,10)
    LDX #10
    LDY #5
    CLC
    JSR PLOT
