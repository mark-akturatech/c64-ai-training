# NMOS 6510 - Operation of DCP: decrement memory then CMP with A. Flags affected: N/Z/C set according to the compare after decrement. Example single-byte form and equivalent legal instructions (DEC then CMP). Test program references.

.byte $07

x2:

.byte $1a
;an effect

...
DEC x2
LDA x2
CMP x1
BNE can be written as:
;an effect
...
LDA x1
DCP x2

;decrements x2 and compares x2 to A

BNE -

Example: decrementing 16bit counter
