# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - CIA #2 register image mirroring ($DD10-$DDFF): Like CIA#1, CIA#2 uses only 16 registers and the remaining 256-byte block contains mirrors every 16 bytes. Advises not to use these mirrored addresses for clarity.

$DD10-$DDFF               CIA #2 Register Images

                          Since the CIA chip requires only enough addressing lines to handle 16
                          registers, none of the higher bits are decoded when addressing the
                          256-byte area that has been assigned to it.  The result is that every
                          16-byte area in this 256-byte block is a mirror of every other.  For
                          the sake of clarity in your programs, it is advisable not to use these
                          addresses.
