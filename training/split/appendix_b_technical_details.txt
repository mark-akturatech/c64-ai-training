# Kick Assembler - Appendix B — Technical details. Describes internal assembler techniques: B.1 Flexible pass algorithm (parses as much as possible each pass and repeats until stable), B.2 Recording of side effects (record and replay directive side effects to speed scripting), B.3 Function Mode vs Asm Mode (fast 'Function Mode' for script-only execution vs full 'Asm Mode' which records side effects), B.4 Invalid value calculations (how invalid/unresolved values propagate through arithmetic/operations and rules for resulting invalid types with examples).
