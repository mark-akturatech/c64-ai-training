# CA65 Assembler - Control Commands (.IFP02 .IFP816 .IFPC02 .IFREF .IMPORT .IMPORTZP)

11.70 .IMPORT
Import a symbol from another module. The command is followed by a comma separated list of symbols to import, with each one optionally followed by an address specification.

Example:


        .import foo
        .import bar: zeropage
  
See: .IMPORTZP

11.71 .IMPORTZP
Import a symbol from another module. The command is followed by a comma separated list of symbols to import. The symbols are explicitly imported as zero page symbols (that is, symbols with values in byte range).

Example:


        .importzp       foo, bar
  
See: .IMPORT

11.72 .INCBIN
Include a file as binary data. The command expects a string argument that is the name of a file to include literally in the current segment. In addition to that, a start offset and a size value may be specified, separated by commas. If no size is specified, all of the file from the start offset to end-of-file is used. If no start position is specified either, zero is assumed (which means that the whole file is inserted).

Example:


        ; Include whole file
        .incbin         "sprites.dat"

        ; Include file starting at offset 256
        .incbin         "music.dat", $100

        ; Read 100 bytes starting at offset 200
        .incbin         "graphics.dat", 200, 100
  
11.73 .INCLUDE
Include another file. Include files may be nested up to a depth of 16.

Example:


        .include        "subs.inc"
  
11.74 .INTERRUPTOR
Export a symbol and mark it as an interruptor. This may be used together with the linker to build a table of interruptor subroutines that are called in an interrupt.

Note: The linker has a feature to build a table of marked routines, but it is your code that must call these routines, so just declaring a symbol as interruptor does nothing by itself.

An interruptor is always exported as an absolute (16 bit) symbol. You don't need to use an additional .export statement, this is implied by .interruptor. It may have an optional priority that is separated by a comma. Higher numeric values mean a higher priority. If no priority is given, the default priority of 7 is used. Be careful when assigning priorities to your own module constructors so they won't interfere with the ones in the cc65 library.

Example:


        .interruptor    IrqHandler
        .interruptor    Handler, 16
  
See the .CONDES command and the separate section Module constructors/destructors explaining the feature in more detail.

11.75 .LIST
Enable output to the listing. The command can be followed by a boolean switch ("on", "off", "+" or "-") and will enable or disable listing output. The option has no effect if the listing is not enabled by the command line switch -l. If -l is used, an internal counter is set to 1. Lines are output to the listing file, if the counter is greater than zero, and suppressed if the counter is zero. Each use of .LIST will increment or decrement the counter.

Example:


        .list   on              ; Enable listing output
  
11.76 .LISTBYTES
Set, how many bytes are shown in the listing for one source line. The default is 12, so the listing will show only the first 12 bytes for any source line that generates more than 12 bytes of code or data. The directive needs an argument, which is either "unlimited", or an integer constant in the range 4..255.

Examples:


        .listbytes      unlimited       ; List all bytes
        .listbytes      12              ; List the first 12 bytes
        .incbin         "data.bin"      ; Include large binary file
  
11.77 .LITERAL
Define byte sized data. Must be followed by a sequence of (byte ranged) expressions or strings. Strings will disregard the current character mapping definition and will be interpreted literally.

Example:


        .literal    "Hello "
        .literal    "world", $0D, $00
  
See: .ASCIIZ, .BYTE

11.78 .LOBYTES
Define byte sized data by extracting only the low byte (that is, bits 0-7) from each expression. This is equivalent to .BYTE with the operator '<' prepended to each expression in its list.

Example:


        .lobytes         $1234, $2345, $3456, $4567
        .hibytes         $fedc, $edcb, $dcba, $cba9
  
which is equivalent to


        .byte            $34, $45, $56, $67
        .byte            $fe, $ed, $dc, $cb
  
Example:


        .define MyTable TableItem0, TableItem1, TableItem2, TableItem3

        TableLookupLo:   .lobytes MyTable
        TableLookupHi:   .hibytes MyTable
  
which is equivalent to


        TableLookupLo:   .byte <TableItem0, <TableItem1, <TableItem2, <TableItem3
        TableLookupHi:   .byte >TableItem0, >TableItem1, >TableItem2, >TableItem3
