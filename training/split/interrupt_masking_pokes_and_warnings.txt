# MACHINE - Machine-specific POKEs to disable/enable interrupts: C64 POKE 56333,127 to disable and 56333,129 to re-enable; VIC-20 POKE 37166,127 / 37166,192; PET POKE 59411,60 / 59411,61. Warning: POKEs may disable keyboard and other services—do not run as direct commands unless you can restore state (e.g., from ML).

the interrupt source.  Something makes an interrupt happen--it might be a
timer, it might be an external signal, or it might even be a screen event.
Whatever it is, we can get to the source of the interrupt and disconnect it.

Almost all interrupt signals are delivered through an IA (interface adapter)
chip; and these chips invariably allow the path of the interrupt signals to
be blocked temporarily.  We'll discuss the IA chips later; for the moment,
the normal interrupt signals can be blocked with the following actions:

  Commodore 64:  Store $7F into address $DC0C (POKE 56333,127) to disable;
  store $81 into the same address (POKE 56333,129) to re-enable.

                                                                        :119:

  VIC-20:  Store $7F into address $912E (POKE 37166,127) to disable; store
  $C0 into the same address (POKE 37166,192) to re-enable.

  PET/CBM:  Store $3C into address $E813 (POKE 59411,60) to disable; store
  $3D into the same address (POKE 59411,61) to re-enable.

It goes without saying that the above POKEs should not normally be given as
direct commands; the first POKE in each case will disable the keyboard (among
other things), and you won't be able to type the restoring POKE.
