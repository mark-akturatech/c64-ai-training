# Contents - Final notes and advice on porting the listings to other assemblers: enumerates that the shown commands may differ across assemblers, reassures the reader these are the only likely differences, and recommends that many assemblers include a translator to convert the Commodore Macro Assembler syntax into their own format to minimize manual changes.

These are all of the commands that may be dif- 
ferent from those in your assembler. With this list, 
you should be able to read all of the program listings 
and modify them to work with your assembler. 
Many assemblers come with a program that will 
translate files with this syntax into their own syn- 
tax. If your assembler has one of these programs, 
you will not have to make many changes by hand 
to assemble the listings on the distribution disk.
