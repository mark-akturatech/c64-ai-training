# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Overview of popular C-64 music editors: DMC and JCH editor (tracker-like), Sidwinder (optimized player), EMS and Odintracker (simple but may have packer issues). Player characteristics: rastertime and memory usage considerations.

Music editors
The most popular music editors still seem to be DMC and the JCH editor. JCH's editor works more like a tracker, while DMC is a more traditional C-64 music editor, where you only see one sequence at a time. The both offer full sound editing capabilities, and the players offer decent rastertime and memory usage.

Some less used editors are Sidwinder by Taki/Natural Beat, which has a very optimized player, that takes up very little raster time, and EMS, by Odie/Cosine, which is, as far as I can tell, just as good as DMC and JCH.

A new editor that is meant to be as simple as possible to use is Odintracker. Unfortunately it doesn't have a very good packer, so the tunes take up huge amounts of memory. This might change, of course.
