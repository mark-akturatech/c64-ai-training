# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $D01C (53276) SPMC — Sprite Multicolor Register bits: bits 0-7 enable multicolor mode per sprite (1=multicolor, 0=hi-res). When enabled, sprite bits are grouped as pairs controlling double-wide dots (sprite effectively 12 dots wide) and four bit-pair combinations map to: 00 background color (transparent), 01 Sprite Multicolor Register 0 ($D025), 10 sprite's own color register ($D027-$D02E), 11 Sprite Multicolor Register 1 ($D026). Two shared multicolor registers plus per-sprite unique color allow up to three foreground colors per sprite.

$D01C        SPMC         Sprite Multicolor Registers

                     0    Select multicolor mode for Sprite 0 (1=multicolor, 0=hi-res)
                     1    Select multicolor mode for Sprite 1 (1=multicolor, 0=hi-res)
                     2    Select multicolor mode for Sprite 2 (1=multicolor, 0=hi-res)
                     3    Select multicolor mode for Sprite 3 (1=multicolor, 0=hi-res)
                     4    Select multicolor mode for Sprite 4 (1=multicolor, 0=hi-res)
                     5    Select multicolor mode for Sprite 5 (1=multicolor, 0=hi-res)
                     6    Select multicolor mode for Sprite 6 (1=multicolor, 0=hi-res)
                     7    Select multicolor mode for Sprite 7 (1=multicolor, 0=hi-res)

                          Sprite multicolor mode is very similar to text and bitmap multicolor
                          modes (see Bit 4 of 53270, $D016).  Normally, the color of each dot of
                          the sprite is controlled by a single bit of sprite shape data.  When
                          the mode is enabled for a sprite, by setting the corresponding bit of
                          this register to 1, the bits of sprite shape data are grouped together
                          in pairs, with each pair of bits controlling a double-wide dot of the
                          sprite display.  By sacrificing some of the horizontal resolution (the
                          sprite, although the same size, is now only 12 dots wide), you gain
                          the use of two additional colors.  The four possible combinations of
                          these bit-pairs display dot colors from the following sources:

			  |    |					     |
			  |----|---------------------------------------------|
                          | 00 | Background Color Register 0 (transparent)   |
                          | 01 | Sprite Multicolor Register 0 (53285, $D025) |
                          | 10 | Sprite Color Registers (53287-94, $D027-E)  |
                          | 11 | Sprite Multicolor Register 1 (53286, $D026) |

                          Like multicolor text characters, multicolor sprites all share two
                          color registers.  While each sprite can display three foreground
                          colors, only one of these colors in unique to that sprite.  The number
                          of unique colors may be increased by combining more than one sprite
                          into a single character.
