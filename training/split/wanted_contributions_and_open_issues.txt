# NMOS 6510 - Wanted / open issues and calls for contribution. Describes outstanding verification tasks (RDY dependency of ANE#imm and LAX#imm needing die-shot investigation), requests for more real-world examples, opcode page-boundary behaviour testing on different CPUs, ARR testing on disk drives, and requests for more code snippets demonstrating decimal mode, dummy memory access quirks, and porting tests to other 6502 variants and platforms.

While the dependency on RDY of ANE#imm and LAX#imm can be verified on the C-64 by
test programs, it can not be explained 100% properly (yet). More investigation by someone
who is able to read die shots may help with that.
◦ More examples of where those two have been used in real world code, which will help
to determine the “best” value (eg for using it in emulation).
◦ LAX#imm appears to be more stable than commonly assumed – it would be interesting
to find more programs that use it in a “non stable” way so we can narrow down the value
of the magic constant more.

•

'unstable address hi byte' opcodes' page boundary crossing and RDY behaviour needs to be
verified on more CPUs.

•

Some opcodes, such as ARR, should also be tested on a disk drive while data is being read.

•

More example code snippets would be great (sharing is caring!)
◦ Examples of interesting (ab)use of the decimal mode
◦ Examples of interesting (ab)use of the dummy memory accesses

•

Experienced 6502 coders from other platforms (Atari 2600/800, Apple II, VIC-20, Plus 4
…) who port the test cases and check them on other 6502 variants and platforms.
