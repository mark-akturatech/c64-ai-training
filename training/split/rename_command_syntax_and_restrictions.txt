# byRiclianll - RENAME command syntax: OPEN 15,8,15 ; PRINT#15,"R0:NEW NAME=OLD NAME" ; CLOSE 15 (alternate: 'R:NEW=OLD'). Explains RO: (rename on drive 0, 0 optional), new file name up to 16 alphanumeric chars (no commas/colons/semicolons/wildcards or cursor control chars), exact spelling required for old name, cannot rename a file currently open for read/write.

The  Rename  Command 

Occasionally  you  will  want  to  change  the  name  of  a  file  stored  on  a  diskette.  To  rename 
a  file  you  first  open  the  command  channel  and  then  send  the  rename  command  like  this: 

SYNTAX:  OPEN   15,    8,  15 

PRINT#15,    "R0:NEW  NAME=0LD  NAME" 
CLOSE  15 

ALTERNATE:    PRINT#15,    "R:NEW  NAME=OLD  NAME" 

EXAMPLE:        OPEN  15,    8,  15 

PRINT#15,    "RO:  DISPLAY  T«{S=DTS" 
CLOSE  15 

dos  5.1:      >ro:new  name=old  name 
>r:new  name=old  name

Again  the  syntax  is  exacting  but  simple  to  follow.  The  RO:  means  to  rename  on  drive 
0.  It  is  short  for  RENAMEO:.  As  before,  the  0  is  optional  on  the  1541.  The  next  parameter 
is  the  new  file  name.  A  file  name  is  generally  alphanumeric  in  nature  and  16  characters 
are  allowed  at  the  maximum.  (Commas,  colons,  semicolons,  and  wild  cards  are  not  per- 
mitted. Cursor  control  and  reverse  video  characters  should  be  avoided.)  The  new  file 
name  is  followed  by  an  "  =  "  sign.  The  last  parameter  is  the  existing  or  old  file  name. 
It  must  be  spelled  out  exactly  as  it  appears  in  the  directory.  Wild  cards  (*,?)  are  not 
allowed.  If  you  make  a  typo  on  this  parameter  or  the  file  does  not  appear  in  the  direc- 
tory, the  rename  command  fails.  No  damage  is  done,  so  relax.  In  the  above  example 
our  new  file  name  is  DISPLAY  T&S.  It  replaces  the  old  file  name  DTS.  One  final  point. 
You  cannot  rename  a  file  that  is  currently  open  for  a  read  or  write.
