# MACHINE - Describes PET variants: Original ROM (identified by '*** COMMODORE BASIC ***' power-up text), Upgrade ROM ('### COMMODORE BASIC ###') and notes about disk handling, garbage collection delay on Upgrade ROM, and upgrade benefits. Introduces PET/CBM 4.0 ROM and 80-column variants with '*** COMMODORE BASIC 4.0 ***' string, new disk commands and elimination of garbage-collection delays.

at power up:

  ### COMMODORE BASIC ###

using the numbers sign (or octothorpe, if you like).

This is much cleaner logic than the previous machine.  Its internal structure
is similar to that of later PET/CBM units (the 4.0 machines), so that is has
much in common with them.

It does not have specialized disk commands such as CATALOG, SCRATCH, or DLOAD
(the 4.0 disk commands); but these are "convenience" commands and the Upgrade
ROM unit can do everything that the later units do.

Upgrade ROM machines have a BASIC annoyance:  under some circumstances,
string variables need to be tidied up using a technique called "garbage
collection."  This takes place automatically when needed; but when it does,
the machine will freeze and seemingly will be dead for a period that may last
from a few seconds to as long as a half hour or more.


PET/CBM--4.0 ROM and 80 Characters
----------------------------------

This class of machine has been a mainstay of the Commodore line for years.
It may be recognized by the message seen at power up:

  *** COMMODORE BASIC 4.0 ***

For the first time, a number appears in the message.

                                                                        :157:

These machines are characterized by new BASIC disk commands (CATALOG, etc.)
and elimination of garbage-collection delays.  Their internal architecture,
especially zero page, is quite similar to the previous Upgrade ROM computers.

Some time after the initial production of 40-column machines, 80-column
machines were introduced, as well as a new 40-column version called the "fat
40."  The later machines are distinguished by new screen/keyboard features,
most noticeable of which is that the cursor movement keys repeat
automatically.

Subsequently, two memory-expanded machines became available.  The 8096 came
fitted with 96K of RAM; the extra 64K was "bank switched" into memory as
needed in blocks of 16K.  The SuperPET, too, had an extra 64K of RAM that was
bank switched in 4K blocks; it also came with an additional microprocessor
(the 6809) used primarily for implementing high-level languages.  Both the
8096 and the SuperPET may be used as conventional CBM 8032 computers; the
extra memory may be ignored.
