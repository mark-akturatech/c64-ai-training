# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $D016 (53270) SCROLX — Horizontal fine scrolling and control register: bits 0-2 = fine horizontal scroll (0-7 dots), bit3 = 38/40-column select, bit4 = multicolor text/bitmap mode, bit5 = video chip reset (0 normal, 1 video off). Default value and demonstration BASIC program for horizontal fine-scroll provided.


$D016        SCROLX       Horizontal Fine Scrolling and Control Register

                     0-2  Fine scroll display horizontally by X dot positions (0-7)
                     3    Select a 38-column or 40-column text display (1=40 columns,
                            0=38 columns)
                     4    Enable multicolor text or multicolor bitmap mode (1=multicolor on,
                            0=multicolor off)
                     5    Video chip reset (0=normal operations, 1=video completely off)
                     6-7  Unused

                          This is one of the two important multifunction control registers on
                          the VIC-II chip.  On power-up, it is set to a default value of 8,
                          which means that the VIC chip Reset line is set for a normal display,
                          Multicolor Mode is disabled, a 40-column text display is selected, and
                          no horizontal fine-scroll offset is used.

                          Bits 0-2.  The first three bits of this chip control vertical fine
                          scrolling of the screen display.  This feature allows you to smoothly
                          move the entire text display back and forth, enabling the display area
                          to act as a window, scrolling over a larger text or character graphics
                          display.

                          Since each text character is eight dots wide, moving each character
                          over one whole character position (known as coarse scrolling) is a
                          relatively big jump, and the motion looks jerky.  By placing a number
                          from 1 to 7 into these three bits, you can move the whole screen
                          display from one to seven dot spaces to the right.

                          Stepping through values 1 to 7 allows you to smoothly make the
                          transition from having a character appear at one screen column to
                          having it appear at the next one over.  To demonstrate this, type in
                          the following program, LIST, and RUN it.

                              10 FOR I=1 TO 50:FOR J=0 TO 7
                              20 POKE 53270,(PEEK(53270)AND248) OR J:NEXT J,I
                              30 FOR I=1 TO 50:FOR J=7 TO 0 STEP-1
                              40 POKE 53270,(PEEK(53270)AND248) OR J:NEXT J,I
