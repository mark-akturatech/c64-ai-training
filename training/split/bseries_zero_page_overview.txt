# MACHINE - B-Series machines (B-128, CBM-256, etc.) zero-page guidance. Multiple zero pages exist (banked systems). For bank 15 (ROM bank) system variables are kept; free areas include $E6-$FF and work areas $20-$2B, $64-$6E. Cautions about critical zero-page locations to avoid modifying (list of addresses such as $1A, $1D-$1F, $2D-$41, etc.).

The Great Zero-Page Hunt
------------------------

Zero page has a different meaning on the B series.  There are several zero
pages.  Usually, you'll want to use values from bank 15 (the ROM bank, where
system variables are kept); but if you are writing programs that will reside
in a different bank, you'll have all of zero page (except locations 0 and 1)
completely at your disposal.

If you need space in bank 15 zero page, you'll need to do some looking
around.  Addresses $E6 to $FF are not used by the system.  Locations $20 to
$2B and $64 to $6E are work areas available for temporary use.

Most zero-page locations may be copied to another part of memory so that
their original contents can be restored after use.  The programmer should
take great care, however, in modifying the following locations, which are
critical within the operating system or BASIC:  $1A, $1D to $1F, $2D to $41,
$43, $5B, $78, $85 to $87, $9E to $AB, $C0 to $E5.
