# byRiclianll - TABLE loop that iterates per-track: LDY *51 (track number), LDA IDL,Y ; STA *13 (store ID low into $13), LDA IDH,Y ; STA *12 (store ID high into $12). Compares Y to #*23 (track 35) with CPY #*23 and BNE TABLE to loop until track 35 is reached. Implements loading of ID low/high bytes from the ID table into device command bytes.
