# MACHINE - Introduces the 650x internal registers: PC (16-bit program counter), A/X/Y (8-bit data registers), SR (status register / PSW), and SP (stack pointer). Includes a block diagram (Figure 1.5) showing registers relative to the address and data buses and notes that PC will be discussed next in more detail.



Microprocessor Registers
------------------------

Within the 650x chip are several storage areas called registers.  Even though
they hold information, they are not considered "memory" since they don't have
an address.  Six of these registers are important to us.  Briefly, they are:

PC:  (16 bits)              The program counter tells where the next
                            instruction will come from.

A, X and Y:  (8 bits each)  These registers hold data.

SR:                         The status register, sometimes called the PSW
                            (processor status word), tells about the results
                            of recent tests, data handling, and so on.

SP:                         The stack pointer keeps track of a temporary
                            storage area.

We will talk about each of these registers in more detail later.  At the
moment, we will concentrate on the PC (program counter).
