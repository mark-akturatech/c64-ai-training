# Contents - Raster register: VIC tracks current scan line as a 9-bit value. Low 8 bits available in RASTER ($D012), 9th bit in bit 7 of YSCRL. You can write 9-bit values to RASTER and YSCRL bit7; when scanline equals stored value bit of VIRQ ($D019) is set. If corresponding bit in VIRQM ($D01A) is set, an interrupt is generated. Use RAST macro to set 9-bit raster number. Remember to store the 9th bit when scheduling raster interrupts.


THE RASTER REGISTER 

The VIC chip keeps track of which scan line the 
electron beam is currently on. Since there are more 
than 255 scan lines in one TV frame, this will be 
a 9 bit value. The least significant 8 bits of the cur- 
rent scan line can be read by reading the RASTER 
1$D012) register. The ninth bit can found in bit 7 
of the YSCRL register. 

You can write a 9 bit value to the RASTER 
register and bit 7 of the YSCRL register. When the 
scan line reaches the value that you stored, bit of 
the VIRQ ($D019) register will be set. If bit of 
the VIRQM ($D01 A) register is set, an interrupt will 
be sent to the microprocessor. You must remember 
to store a ninth bit when storing a RASTER 
number, or the comparison will not take place. The 
RAST macro will set the 9 bit raster number for 
you.
