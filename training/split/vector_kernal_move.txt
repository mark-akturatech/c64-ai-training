# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - VECTOR: KERNAL MOVE ($FD1A). Reads/writes the vectors at $0314-$0333 or $FD30 depending on carry state. Uses MEMUSS temp in $C3/$C4 and moves 0x20 bytes (31 down to 0) between the two regions via indirect indexed addressing. Handles both read and write (controlled by carry) with LDA/STA loops and DEY/DEcrement counter.

                                *** VECTOR: KERNAL MOVE
                                The KERNAL routine VECTOR ($ff8d) jumps to this routine.
                                It reads or sets the vectors at $0314-$0333 depending on
                                state of carry. X/Y contains the address to read/write
                                area, normally $fd30. See $fd15.
                                A problem is that the RAM under the ROM at $fd30 always
                                gets a copy of the contents in the ROM then you perform
                                the copy.
