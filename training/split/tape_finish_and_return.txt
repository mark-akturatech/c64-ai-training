# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL ROM Disassembly (English, "CBM") - Finalization after a successful load: clear carry for a good exit, set up end-load address by loading EAL/EAH into X/Y, and return (RTS). This chunk contains the epilogue for both tape and IEEE successful exits.

- "tape_addressing_and_block_load" which expands on Follows TRD block-load and handles carry/result, computes end address
- "ieee_receive_and_store_loop" which expands on IEEE path also jumps to this general successful-return logic after closing channels
