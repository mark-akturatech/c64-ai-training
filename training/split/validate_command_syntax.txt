# byRiclianll - VALIDATE command syntax: OPEN 15,8,15 ; PRINT#15,"VO" (or "V") ; CLOSE 15. 'V' is VALIDATE; 0 (drive number) optional on a single 1541. VALIDATE reconstructs the BAM by freeing all blocks, tracing each directory file and marking blocks in use, then writing the new BAM to disk.

The  Validate  Command 

This  command  tells  the  DOS  to  reconstruct  its  map  which  shows  where  information  is 
stored  on  the  diskette,  so  it  conforms  to  the  files  listed  in  the  directory.  This  is  a  simple 
way  to  decorrupt  a  damaged  diskette.  However,  it  is  not  a  failsafe  command  as  will  be 
explained  shortly.  A  validate  command  looks  like  this: 


SYNTAX: 


OPEN  15,  8,  15 
PRINT#15,  "VO" 
CLOSE  15 


ALTERNATE:    PRINT#15,  "V" 


DOS  5. 1 


>V0 


The  V  is  an  abbreviation  for  VALIDATE.  As  before,  the  0  is  optional  for  the  1541  drive.
