# The MOS 6567/6569 video controller (VIC-II) and its application in the Commodore 64 - Covers sprite display modes and size expansion: standard mode (1 bit per pixel; 0 transparent, 1 sprite color from $D027-$D02E) and multicolor mode (2 bits per pixel, resolution halved horizontally to 12x21). Explains X and Y expansion: X-expansion outputs pixels at half frequency (pixels doubled horizontally); Y-expansion causes sprite address generator to read the same addresses for two consecutive lines (pixels doubled vertically). Notes that X and Y expansions are implemented differently and combined effects (e.g., x-expanded multicolor pixel size).

Like the text and bitmap graphics, the sprites also have a standard mode
and a multicolor mode. In standard mode, every bit directly corresponds to
one pixel on the screen. A "0" pixel is transparent and the underlying
graphics are visible below it, a "1" pixel is displayed in the sprite color
from registers $d027-$d02e belonging to the sprite in question. In
multicolor mode, two adjacent bits form one pixel, thus reducing the
resolution of the sprite to 12�21 (the pixels are twice as wide).

Moreover, the sprites can be doubled in their size on the screen in X
and/or Y direction (X/Y expansion). For that, every sprite pixel simply
becomes twice as wide/tall, the resolution doesn't change. So a pixel of an
x-expanded multicolor sprite is four times as wide as a pixel of an
unexpanded standard sprite. Although both expansions look similar, they are
implemented completely differently in the VIC. The X expansion simply
instructs the sprite data sequencer to output pixels with half frequency.
But the Y expansion makes the sprite address generator read from the same
addresses in each two lines in sequence so that every sprite line is output
twice.
