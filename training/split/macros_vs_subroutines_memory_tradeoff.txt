# Contents - Explains the tradeoff between macros and subroutines: macros are expanded inline each time they are used (consuming code space per use), whereas subroutines (invoked via JSR) are stored once. Recommends using subroutines for frequently used or large functions (example: text display routines) and discusses building a subroutine library analogous to a macro library.


There are many cases in which it is a better idea 
to use a subroutine instead of a macro. Each time 
a macro name is entered into a program, the 
assembler expands it into its individual instructions. 
This means that each time the macro is called, it 
is treated as if you have entered all of its instruc- 
tions by hand, and uses the same amount of memory 
as if you had. 

For a function that is repeatedly used and takes 
a large amount of code, it is better to use a 
subroutine. A subroutine is called using the JSR in- 
struction and is only stored once in the program. 
If you write a routine to display text on the screen 
that many different parts of the program are going 
to be calling on often, it is best treated as a 
subroutine. You may build up a library of 
subroutines in the same manner in which you build 
up a library of macros.
