# ********* - Explains that opening RS-232 device (device 2) lowers pointers and end-of-user-RAM by 512 bytes to create two 256-byte input/output buffers; warns these buffers overwrite variables at the top of memory and notes that BASIC issues a CLR when device 2 is opened, so RS-232 should be opened before defining variables or reserving safe areas for machine code.

2.  Then the RS-232 device (number 2) is opened, this pointer and the
pointer to the end of user RAM at 643 are lowered by 512 bytes in
order to create two 256-byte buffers, one for input and the other for
output.

Since the contents of these buffers will overwrite any variables at
the top of memory, a CLR command is issued at the time device 2 is
opened.  Therefore, the RS-232 device should be opened before defining
any variables, and before setting aside a safe area for machine
language programs or other uses, as described above.
