  CLOSE

  TYPE: I/O Statement
  FORMAT: CLOSE <file number>

    Action: This statement shuts off any data file or channel to a device.
  The file number is the same as when the file or device was OPENed (see
  OPEN statement and the section on INPUT/OUTPUT programming).
    When working with storage devices like cassette tape and disks, the
  CLOSE operation stores any incomplete buffers to the device. When this
  is not performed, the file will be incomplete on the tape and unreadable
  on the disk. The CLOSE operation isn't as necessary with other devices,
  but it does free up memory for other files. See your external device
  manual for more details.
