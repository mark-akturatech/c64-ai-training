# COMMODORE 64 - Describes per-MOB magnification (2× expansion) in horizontal and vertical directions using MnXE and MnYE control bits. Specifies registers: 23 ($17) controls horizontal expand (MnXE), 29 ($1D) controls vertical expand (MnYE). Notes that expansion doubles overall MOB dimensions without increasing resolution (24×21 array or 12×21 in multi-color), and that combination of multi-color and expansion can yield dot sizes up to 4× standard.

  MAGNIFICATION

    Each MOB can be selectively expanded (2X) in both the horizontal and
  vertical directions. Two registers contain the control bits (MnXE,MnYE)
  for the magnification control.


    REGISTER  |                        FUNCTION
  ------------+------------------------------------------------------------
     23 ($17) | Horizontal expand MnXE-"1"=expand; "0"=normal
     29 ($1D) | Vertical expand MnYE-"1"=expand; "0"=normal

  When MOBs are expanded, no increase in resolution is realized. The same
  24*21 array (12X21 if multi-colored) is displayed, but the overall MOB
  dimension is doubled in the desired direction (the smallest MOB dot may
  be up to 4X standard dot dimension if a MOB is both multi-colored and
  expanded).
