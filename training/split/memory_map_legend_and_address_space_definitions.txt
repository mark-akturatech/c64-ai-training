# COMMODORE 64 - Legend entries that explain shorthand used in the memory map: definitions of Kernal (E000-FFFF), IO/C, IO/RAM, I/O, BASIC (A000-BFFF), ROMH (A000-BFFF or E000-FFFF), ROML (8000-9FFF), RAM, and '-' open address space behavior (1000-7FFF and A000-CFFF where internal memory does not detect accesses except VIC-II DMA/refresh).

    Legend: Kernal      E000-FFFF       Kernal ROM.

	    IO/C        D000-DFFF       I/O address space or Character
					generator ROM, selected by -CHAREN.
					If the CHAREN bit is clear,
					the character generator ROM is
					chosen. If it is set, the
					I/O chips are accessible.

	    IO/RAM      D000-DFFF       I/O address space or RAM,
					selected by -CHAREN.
					If the CHAREN bit is clear,
					the character generator ROM is
					chosen. If it is set, the
					internal RAM is accessible.

	    I/O         D000-DFFF       I/O address space.
					The -CHAREN line has no effect.

	    BASIC       A000-BFFF       BASIC ROM.

	    ROMH        A000-BFFF or    External ROM with the -ROMH line
			E000-FFFF       connected to its -CS line.

	    ROML        8000-9FFF       External ROM with the -ROML line
					connected to its -CS line.

	    RAM         various ranges  Commodore 64's internal RAM.

	    -           1000-7FFF and   Open address space.
			A000-CFFF       The Commodore 64's memory chips
					do not detect any memory accesses
					to this area except the VIC-II's
					DMA and memory refreshes.
