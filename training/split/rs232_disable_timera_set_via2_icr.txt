# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Disable Timer A interrupt and program VIA2 ICR for RS-232 operation. Saves the VIA2 ICR ($DD0D), merges with the RS-232 interrupt enable byte ($02A1), ensures the interrupt-enable bit is set, and stores the updated enable byte and ICR. Ends with RTS.
