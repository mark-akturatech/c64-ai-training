# C64 KERNAL API (Lee Davison) - $FFCC — Close input and output channels. Clears all open channels and restores I/O channels to defaults (input=keyboard(0), output=screen(3)). If a serial channel is being closed an UNTALK or UNLISTEN is sent as appropriate. Leaving listeners open allows broadcasting to multiple devices (e.g., printer TALK + disk LISTEN for direct printing).

$FFCC          close input and output channels
               
               This routine is called to clear all open channels and restore the I/O channels to
               their original default values. It is usually called after opening other I/O
               channels and using them for input/output operations. The default input device is
               0, the keyboard. The default output device is 3, the screen.
               
               If one of the channels to be closed is to the serial port, an UNTALK signal is sent
               first to clear the input channel or an UNLISTEN is sent to clear the output channel.
               By not calling this routine and leaving listener(s) active on the serial bus,
               several devices can receive the same data from the VIC at the same time. One way to
               take advantage of this would be to command the printer to TALK and the disk to
               LISTEN. This would allow direct printing of a disk file.
