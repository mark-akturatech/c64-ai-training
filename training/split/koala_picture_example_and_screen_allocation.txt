# Kick Assembler - Example loading a Koala Paint picture into memory with LoadBinary and placing it on screen: .var picture = LoadBinary("picture.prg", KOALA_TEMPLATE) and code showing BasicUpstart, copying color/bitmap/screenram using .fill picture.getScreenRamSize(), picture.getScreenRam(i) etc. Demonstrates reallocation of screen and color RAM using *= and .fill directives.


Bitmap,ScreenRam,ColorRam,BackgroundColor
Files from Koala Paint

BF_FLI

ColorRam,ScreenRam,Bitmap

Files from Blackmails FLI editor.

BF_DOODLE

ColorRam,Bitmap

Files from Doodle

So if you want to load a FLI picture, just write
.var fliPicture = LoadBinary("GreatPicture", BF_FLI)

The formats were chosen so they cover the outputs of Timanthes (NB. Timanthes doesn’t save the background
color in koala format, so if you use that you will get an overflow error).
TIP: If you want to know how data is placed in the above formats, just print the constant to the console while
assembling. Example:
.print "Koala format="+BF_KOALA

12.3. Import of SID Files
The script language knows the format of SID files. This means that you can import files directly from the HVSC
(High Voltage Sid Collection) which uses this format. To do this you use the LoadSid function which returns a
value that represents the sidfile.

Import and Export

.var music = LoadSid("C:/c64/HVSC_44-all-of-them/C64Music/Tel_Jeroen/
Closing_In.sid")

From this you can extract data such as the init address, the play address, info about the music and the song data.
