# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $D020-$D02E — VIC-II Color Registers: $D020 Border Color, $D021 Background Color 0, $D022-$D024 Background Colors 1-3 (used with extended background mode and multicolor), $D025-$D026 Sprite Multicolor 0/1, $D027-$D02E Sprite 0-7 color registers. Note: only low 4 bits are connected; mask with AND 15 when reading.


$D020-$D02E               VIC-II Color Register

                          Although these color registers are used for various purposes, all of
                          them have one thing in common.  Like the Color RAM Nybbles, only the
                          lower four bits are connected.  Therefore, when reading these
                          registers, you must mask out the upper four bits (that is,
                          BORDERCOLOR=PEEK(53280)AND15) in order to get a true reading.

$D020        EXTCOL       Border Color Register

                          The color value here determines the color of the border or frame
                          around the central display area.  The entire screen is set to this
                          color when the blanking feature of Bit 4 of 53265 ($D011) is enabled.
                          The default color value is 14 (light blue).

$D021        BGCOL0       Background Color 0

                          This register sets the background color for all text modes, sprite
                          graphics, and multicolor bitmap graphics.  The default color value is
                          6 (blue).

$D022        BGCOL1       Background Color 1

                          This register sets the color for the 01 bit-pair of multicolor
                          character graphics, and the background color for characters having
                          screen codes 64-127 in extended background color text mode.  The
                          default color value is 1 (white).

$D023        BGCOL2       Background Color 2

                          This register sets the color for the 10 bit-pair of multicolor
                          character graphics, and the background color for characters having
                          screen codes 128-191 in extended background color text mode.  The
                          default color value is 2 (red).

$D024        BGCOL3       Background Color 3

                          This register sets the background color for characters having screen
                          codes between 192 and 255 in extended background color text mode.  The
                          default color value is 3 (cyan).

$D025        SPMC0        Sprite Multicolor Register 0

                          This register sets the color that is displayed by the 01 bit-pair in
                          multicolor sprite graphics.  The default color value is 4 (purple).

$D026        SPMC1        Sprite Multicolor Register 1

                          This register sets the color that is displayed by the 11 bit-pair in
                          multicolor sprite graphics.  The default color value is 0 (black).

$D027-$D02E               Sprite Color Registers

                          These registers are used to set the color to be displayed by bits of
                          hi-res sprite data having a value of 1, and by bit-pairs of multicolor
                          sprite data having a value of 10.  The color of each sprite is
                          determined by its own individual color register.

$D027        SP0COL       Sprite 0 Color Register (the default color value is 1, white)

$D028        SP1COL       Sprite 1 Color Register (the default color value is 2, red)

$D029        SP2COL       Sprite 2 Color Register (the default color value is 3, cyan)

$D02A        SP3COL       Sprite 3 Color Register (the default color value is 4, purple)

$D02B        SP4COL       Sprite 4 Color Register (the default color value is 5, green)

$D02C        SP5COL       Sprite 5 Color Register (the default color value is 6, blue)

$D02D        SP6COL       Sprite 6 Color Register (the default color value is 7, yellow)

$D02E        SP7COL       Sprite 7 Color Register (the default color value is 12, medium gray)
