# MACHINE - Chapter 5 summary: recap of implied/accumulator/immediate modes; absolute/zero-page addressed single locations; absolute/zero-page indexed for ranges up to 256; relative branches limited reach; indirect (JMP) and indirect, indexed as most important for data anywhere in memory; indirect addresses must reside in zero page.

Things You Have Learned
-----------------------

- Three address modes are not addresses at all.  Implied addressing means no
  address at all; accumulator addressing uses the A register and means the
  same thing; and immediate addressing uses a value, not an address.

                                                                         :89:

- Absolute addresses reference one location only, somewhere in memory.  Zero-
  page addresses reference a single address in the range $0000 to $00FF--the
  high byte of the address (00) is the memory page.  These address modes are
  used for fixed locations containing work values or system interfaces.

- Absolute, indexed and zero-page, indexed allows the named address to be
  adjusted by the contents of an index register--X or Y.  These instructions
  can reach a range of up to 256 addresses.  They are commonly used for
  tables of data or temporary storage areas.

- Relative addresses are used exclusively with branch instructions.  They
  have a limited "reach" of about 127 locations forward or backward.  It
  takes a little arithmetic to calculate the proper values, but the computer
  usually works this out for us.

- Indirect addressing is used only for jumps, most often to allow a fixed ROM
  program to take a variable jump.  The average machine language programmer
  will seldom need these, but the principle of indirect addressing is worth
  learning.

- Indirect, indexed addressing is the most important way to deal with data
  anywhere in memory.  We may reach anywhere by setting the indirect address,
  then we may "fine adjust" that address by indexing it with the contents of
  Y.

- Indirect, indexed addressing requires the indirect address to be in zero-
  page.  We need to conserve zero-page locations for this use.

- An addressing mode called indexed, indirect is rarely used when programming
  Commodore computers, but it's there if you want it.
