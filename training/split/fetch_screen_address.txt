# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Fetches a screen line start address for a given line index: reads low byte from the ROM table (LDA $ECF0,X -> $D1), reads high byte from RAM table ($D9,X), masks it to the 0-3 page (AND #$03), ORs with the screen memory page (ORA $0288), and stores the result as the current screen line pointer high byte ($D2). Returns (RTS).
