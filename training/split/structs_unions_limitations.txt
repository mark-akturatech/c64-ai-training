# ca65 Users Guide - Current limitations: structs/unions are implemented as nested symbol tables only, there is no type system. .TAG only allocates space (can't initialize .TAG-declared variables), and adding an embedded structure via .TAG doesn't make it accessible via '::'.

15.6 Limitations
Structs and unions currently are implemented as nested symbol tables (in fact, they were a by-product of the improved scoping rules). Currently, the assembler has no idea of types. That means that the .TAG keyword only will allocate space. You won't be able to initialize variables declared with .TAG; and, adding an embedded structure to another structure with .TAG will not make that added structure accessible by using the '::' operator.
