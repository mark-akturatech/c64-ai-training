# A Minimal C64 Datasette Program Loader - How bits and bytes are encoded using pulses: each data bit uses two pulses (Short/Medium = 0, Medium/Short = 1); first pulse alone determines the bit. Byte marker is Long/Medium, end-of-data marker is Long/Short. Complete byte format: marker (L/M), bits 0..7 (S/M pairs), parity (M/S). Parity uses inverted odd parity.

Bit and Byte Encoding
---------------------

Every bit is encoded using two pulses. The first pulse is either short or
medium, and the second pulse is the other one:

    Short/Medium = 0 bit
    Medium/Short = 1 bit

This is differentiated by only checking the first pulse: if it's short,
the bit is 0; if it's medium, the bit is 1. The second pulse is ignored
for data purposes (it serves as a consistency check in the full KERNAL
loader).

A byte marker (Long/Medium) signals byte boundaries.
An end-of-data marker (Long/Short) signals file termination.

The complete byte structure:

    L/M    S/M  S/M  S/M  S/M  S/M  S/M  S/M  S/M  M/S
    marker bit0 bit1 bit2 bit3 bit4 bit5 bit6 bit7 parity

The parity bit uses odd parity (inverted).
