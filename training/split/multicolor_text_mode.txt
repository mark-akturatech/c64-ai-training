# The MOS 6567/6569 video controller (VIC-II) and its application in the Commodore 64 - ECM=0, BMM=0, MCM=1 multicolor text mode. Allows four-colored characters with halved horizontal resolution: when c-data bit11=0, character behaves like standard text mode (colors 0-7); if bit11=1, two adjacent bits form one pixel (2 bits/pixel). c-data encodes MC flag and color for '11' pixels; g-access address same as text; g-data interpretation: if MC flag=0, 8 pixels 1bpp like standard; if MC flag=1, 4 pixels 2bpp where '00'=background0 ($D021), '01'=background1 ($D022), '10'=background2 ($D023), '11'=color from c-data bits 8-10. Note: '01' treated as background for sprite priority/collision.

3.7.3.2. Multicolor text mode (ECM/BMM/MCM=0/0/1)
-------------------------------------------------

This mode allows for displaying four-colored characters at the cost of
horizontal resolution. If bit 11 of the c-data is zero, the character is
displayed as in standard text mode with only the colors 0-7 available for
the foreground. If bit 11 is set, each two adjacent bits of the dot matrix
form one pixel. By this means, the resolution of a character of reduced to
4�8 (the pixels are twice as wide, so the total width of the characters
doesn't change).

It is interesting that not only the bit combination "00" but also "01" is
regarded as "background" for the sprite priority and collision detection.
