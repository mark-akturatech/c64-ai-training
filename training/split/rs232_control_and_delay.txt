# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - RS232/6551 control helpers and small delays: ACPTR (receive from serial bus uses CIA timer, sets ST on timeouts or EOI), SERIAL CLOCK ON/OFF (manipulate DD00 bit for CLK), SERIAL OUTPUT 1/0 (set data out line via DD00), GET SERIAL DATA AND CLOCK IN (read DD00 and shift into carry & bit7), DELAY 1 MS (software delay loop). These low-level port manipulations are used by both RS232 and IEC code for timing and bit-level I/O.

                                *** SERIAL CLOCK ON
                                This routine sets the clock outline on the serial bus to
                                1. This means writing a 0 to the port. This value is
                                reversed by hardware on the bus.

                                The serial port I/O register is stabilised and read. The
                                data is shifted into carry and CLK into bit 7. This way,
                                both the data and clock can bee determined by flags in the
                                processor status register. Note that the values read are
                                true, and do not need to be reversed in the same way as
                                the output line do.
