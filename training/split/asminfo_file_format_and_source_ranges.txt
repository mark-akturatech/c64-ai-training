# Kick Assembler - Describes AsmInfo file format: sections start with [name], lines are semicolon-separated fields. Introduces 'source range' special field representing character ranges as five integers: startline, startpos, endline, endpos, fileindex (e.g., 38,8,38,17,1).

index;filepath

Important: The file path might contain semicolons!
An example of a list is:
[files]
0;KickAss.jar:/include/autoinclude.asm
1;test1.asm

Notice the first entry starts with KickAss.jar. This means that its a file included from inside the KickAss.jar file.

15.4.6. Syntax section
The syntax section has the format:
type;sourcerange

Example:
[syntax]
operator;21,20,21,20,0

Note: Its the plan to add more fields here, like where a the label is defined if its a label reference, etc.

15.4.7. Errors section
The errors section has the format:
level;sourcerange;message

Example:
[errors]
