# ********* - Keyboard decoding and tables: SCNKEY (60039 $EA87) reads keyboard and returns keycode; routines decode keystroke and place ASCII in keyboard buffer (60128 $EAE0), set up proper keyboard decode table (60232 $EB48) which chooses among four 64-entry PETASCII decode tables (standard 60289 $EB81, SHIFT 60354 $EBC2, Commodore Logo 60419 $EC03, CONTROL 60536 $EC78). Also includes keyboard decode table vectors (60281 $EB79) and handling of SHIFT/Logo toggles to change character set (SET LOWERCASE/UPPERCASE 60484 $EC44 and related toggles).

Check for a Color Change

This routine is used by the screen CHROUT routine to check if the
character to be printed is one that causes the current foreground
color to change (such as the CTRL-1 combination).

PETASCII Color Code Equivalent Table

This table gives the PETASCII values of the color change characters
for each of the 16 possible colors.  These values are:

144 ($90)  Change to color 0 (black)
  5 ($05)  Change to color 0 (white)
 28 ($1C)  Change to color 0 (red)
159 ($9F)  Change to color 0 (cyan)
156 ($9C)  Change to color 0 (purple)
 30 ($1E)  Change to color 0 (green)
 31 ($1F)  Change to color 0 (blue)
158 ($9E)  Change to color 0 (yellow)
129 ($81)  Change to color 0 (orange)
149 ($95)  Change to color 0 (brown)
150 ($96)  Change to color 0 (light red)
151 ($97)  Change to color 0 (dark gray)
152 ($98)  Change to color 0 (medium gray)
153 ($99)  Change to color 0 (light green)
154 ($9A)  Change to color 0 (light blue)
155 ($9B)  Change to color 0 (light gray)

Scroll Screen

This subroutine moves all of the screen lines up, so that a blank line
is created at the bottom of the screen and the top screen line is
lost.  If the top logical line is two physical lines long, all lines
are moved up two lines.  Holding down the CTRL key will cause a brief
pause after the scroll.

59749         $E965
Insert a Blank Line on the Screen

This subroutine is used when INSERTing to add a blank physical line to
a logical line.

59848         $E9C8
Move Screen Line

This subroutine is used by the scroll routine to move one screen line
(and its associated Color RAM) up a line.

59872         $E9E0
Set Temporary Color Pointer for Scrolling

This subrouting sets up a pointer in 17-175 ($AE-$AF) to the Color RAM
address that corresponds to the temporary screen line address in
172-173 ($AC-$AD).

59888         $E9F0
Set Pointer to Screen Address of Start of Line

This subroutine puts the address of the first byte of the screen line
designated by the .X register into locations 209-210 ($D1-$D2).

59903         $E9FF
Clear Screen Line

This subroutine writes space characters to an entire line of screen
memory, and clears the corresponding line of color memory to color in
Background Color Register 0 (53281, $D021).

59923         $EA13
Set Cursor Blink Timing and Color Memory Address for Print to Screen

This subroutine sets the cursor blink countdown and sets the pointer
to Color RAM.  It then falls through to the next routine.

59932         $EA1C
Store to Screen

This routine stores the character in the .A register to the screen
address pointed to by 209 ($D1), and stores the color in the .X
register to the address pointed to by 243 ($F3).

59940         $EA24
Synchronize Color RAM Pointer to Screen Line Pointer

This subroutine sets the pointer at 243 ($F3) to the address of the
beginning of the line of Color RAM which corresponds to the current
line of screen RAM (whose pointer is at 209 ($D1)).

59953         $EA31
IRQ Interrupt Entry

This is the entry point to the standard IRQ interrupt handler.  Timer
A of CIA #1 is set at power-on to cause an IRQ interrupt to occur
