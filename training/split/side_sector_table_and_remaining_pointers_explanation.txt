# byRiclianll - Explains that side sectors 4 and 5 are not yet allocated in this example and describes the remaining 240 bytes in the side sector (bytes 16-255) as track/sector pointers for the first 120 data blocks. Notes that bytes 16-17 point to the first data block of the sequential portion (track 17, sector 03), which matches the directory.


We  can  see  from  the  table  above  that  side  sectors  4  and  5  have  not  yet  been  allocated. 
Once  our  data  file  expands  to  encompass  more  than  480  and  600  sectors,  respectively, 
they  will  be  allocated,  provided  there  is  room  on  the  diskette. 

The  remaining  240  bytes  are  track  and  sector  pointers  to  the  first  120  blocks  in  the  se- 
quential file.  From  bytes  16  and  17  of  side  sector  0  we  see  that  our  data  begins  at  track 
17  ($11),  sector  03  ($03).  (This  is  the  track  and  sector  recorded  in  the  directory  itself.) 
Track  17,  sector  03  chains  to  track  17  ($11),  sector  14  ($0E)  which  chains  to  track  17 
($11),  sector  4  ($04)  and  so  on.
