# CA65 Assembler - Control Commands (.I16 .I8 .IF .IFBLANK .IFCONST .IFDEF .IFNBLANK .IFNDEF .IFNREF)

11.47 .I16
Valid only in 65816 mode. Assume the index registers are 16 bit.

Note: This command will not emit any code, it will tell the assembler to create 16 bit operands for immediate operands.

See also the .I8 and .SMART commands.

11.48 .I8
Valid only in 65816 mode. Assume the index registers are 8 bit.

Note: This command will not emit any code, it will tell the assembler to create 8 bit operands for immediate operands.

See also the .I16 and .SMART commands.

11.49 .IF
Conditional assembly: Evaluate an expression and switch assembler output on or off depending on the expression. The expression must be a constant expression, that is, all operands must be defined.

A expression value of zero evaluates to FALSE, any other value evaluates to TRUE.

11.50 .IFBLANK
Conditional assembly: Check if there are any remaining tokens in this line, and evaluate to FALSE if this is the case, and to TRUE otherwise. If the condition is not true, further lines are not assembled until an .ELSE, .ELSEIF or .ENDIF directive.

This command is often used to check if a macro parameter was given. Since an empty macro parameter will evaluate to nothing, the condition will evaluate to TRUE if an empty parameter was given.

Example:


        .macro     arg1, arg2
        .ifblank   arg2
                   lda     #arg1
        .else
                   lda     #arg2
        .endif
        .endmacro

11.51 .IFCONST
Conditional assembly: Evaluate an expression and switch assembler output on or off depending on the constness of the expression.

A const expression evaluates to to TRUE, a non const expression (one containing an imported or currently undefined symbol) evaluates to FALSE.

See also: .CONST

11.52 .IFDEF
Conditional assembly: Check if a symbol is defined. Must be followed by a symbol name. The condition is true if the given symbol is already defined, and false otherwise.

See also: .DEFINED

11.53 .IFNBLANK
Conditional assembly: Check if there are any remaining tokens in this line, and evaluate to TRUE if this is the case, and to FALSE otherwise. If the condition is not true, further lines are not assembled until an .ELSE, .ELSEIF or .ENDIF directive.

This command is often used to check if a macro parameter was given. Since an empty macro parameter will evaluate to nothing, the condition will evaluate to FALSE if an empty parameter was given.

Example:


        .macro     arg1, arg2
                   lda     #arg1
        .ifnblank  arg2
                   lda     #arg2
        .endif
        .endmacro
  
See also: .BLANK

11.54 .IFNDEF
Conditional assembly: Check if a symbol is defined. Must be followed by a symbol name. The condition is true if the given symbol is not defined, and false otherwise.

See also: .DEFINED

11.55 .IFNREF
Conditional assembly: Check if a symbol is referenced. Must be followed by a symbol name. The condition is true if the given symbol was not referenced before, and false otherwise.

See also: .REFERENCED

11.56 .IFP02
Conditional assembly: Check if the assembler is currently in 6502 mode (see .P02 command).

11.57 .IFP02X
Conditional assembly: Check if the assembler is currently in 6502X mode (see .P02X command).

11.58 .IFP4510
Conditional assembly: Check if the assembler is currently in 4510 mode (see .P4510 command).

11.59 .IFP45GS02
Conditional assembly: Check if the assembler is currently in 45GS02 mode (see .P45GS02 command).

11.60 .IFP6280
Conditional assembly: Check if the assembler is currently in HuC6280 mode (see .P6280 command).

11.61 .IFP816
Conditional assembly: Check if the assembler is currently in 65816 mode (see .P816 command).

11.62 .IFPC02
Conditional assembly: Check if the assembler is currently in 65C02 mode (see .PC02 command).

11.63 .IFPCE02
Conditional assembly: Check if the assembler is currently in 65CE02 mode (see .PCE02 command).

11.64 .IFPDTV
Conditional assembly: Check if the assembler is currently in 6502DTV mode (see .PDTV command).

11.65 .IFPM740
Conditional assembly: Check if the assembler is currently in M740 mode (see .PM740 command).

11.66 .IFPSC02
Conditional assembly: Check if the assembler is currently in 65SC02 mode (see .PSC02 command).

11.67 .IFPSWEET16
Conditional assembly: Check if the assembler is currently in Sweet16 mode (see .PSWEET16 command).

11.68 .IFREF
Conditional assembly: Check if a symbol is referenced. Must be followed by a symbol name. The condition is true if the given symbol was referenced before, and false otherwise.

This command may be used to build subroutine libraries in include files (you may use separate object modules for this purpose too).

Example:


        .ifref  ToHex                   ; If someone used this subroutine
        ToHex:  tay                     ; Define subroutine
                lda     HexTab,y
                rts
        .endif

11.69 .IFPWC02
Conditional assembly: Check if the assembler is currently in 65WC02 mode (see .PWC02 command).
