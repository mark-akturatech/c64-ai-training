  SIGNAL DESCRIPTION

  Clocks (01, 02)

    The 6510 requires a two-phase non-overlapping clock that runs at the
  Vcc voltage level.

  Address Bus (A0-A15)

    These outputs are TTL compatible, capable of driving one standard TTL
  load and 130 pf.

  Data Bus (D0-D7)

    Eight pins are used for the data bus. This is a Bi-Directional bus,
  transferring data to and from the device and peripherals. The outputs are
  tri-state buffers capable of driving one standard TTL load and 130 pf.

  Reset

    This input is used to reset or start the microprocessor from a power
  down condition. During the time that this line is held low, writing to or
  from the microprocessor is inhibited. When a positive edge is detected on
  the input, the microprocessor will immediately begin the reset sequence.
    After a system initialization time of six clock cycles, the mask
  interrupt flag will be set and the microprocessor will load the program
  counter from the memory vector locations FFFC and FFFD. This is the start
  location for program control.
    After Vcc reaches 4.75 volts in a power-up routine, reset must be held
  low for at least two clock cycles. At this time the R/W signal will
  become valid.
    When the reset signal goes high following these two clock cycles, the
  microprocessor will proceed with the normal reset procedure detailed
  above.

  Interrupt Request (/IRQ)

    This TTL level input requests that an interrupt sequence begin within
  the microprocessor. The microprocessor will complete the current in-
  struction being executed before recognizing the request. At that time,
  the interrupt mask bit in the Status Code Register will be examined. If
  the interrupt mask flag is not set, the microprocessor will begin an

  410   APPENDIX L

  interrupt sequence. The Program Counter and Processor Status Register are
  stored in the stack. The microprocessor will then set the interrupt mask
  flag high so that no further interrupts may occur. At the end of this
  cycle, the program counter low will be loaded from address FFFE, and
  program counter high from location FFFF, therefore transferring program
  control to the memory vector located at these addresses.

  Address Enable Control (AEC)

    The Address Bus is valid only when the Address Enable Control line is
  high. When low, the Address Bus is in a high-impedance state. This
  feature allows easy DMA and multiprocessor systems.

  I/O Port (P0-P7)

    Six pins are used for the peripheral port, which can transfer data to
  or from peripheral devices. The Output Register is located in RAM at
  address 0001, and the Data Direction Register is at Address 0000. The
  outputs are capable at driving one standard TTL load and 130 pf.

  Read/Write (R/W)

    This signal is generated by the microprocessor to control the direction
  of data transfers on the Data Bus. This line is high except when the
  microprocessor is writing to memory or a peripheral device.

  ADDRESSING MODES

  ACCUMULATOR ADDRESSING - This form of addressing is represented with a
  one byte instruction, implying an operation on the accumulator.

  IMMEDIATE ADDRESSING - In immediate addressing, the operand is contained
  in the second byte of the instruction, with no further memory addressing
  required.

  ABSOLUTE ADDRESSING - In absolute addressing, the second byte of the
  instruction specifies the eight low order bits of the effective address
  while the third byte specifies the eight high order bits. Thus, the
  absolute addressing mode allows access to the entire 64K bytes of
  addressable memory.

  ZERO PAGE ADDRESSING - The zero page instructions allow for shorter code

                                                           APPENDIX L   411

  and execution times by only fetching the second byte of the instruction
  and assuming a zero high address byte. Careful use of the zero page can
  result in significant increase in code efficiency.

  INDEXED ZERO PAGE ADDRESSING - (X, Y indexing)-This form of addressing is
  used in conjunction with the index register and is referred to as "Zero
  Page, X" or "Zero Page, Y." The effective address is calculated by adding
  the second byte to the contents of the index register. Since this is a
  form of "Zero Page" addressing, the content of the second byte references
  a location in page zero. Additionally, due to the "Zero Page" addressing
  nature of this mode, no carry is added to the high order 8 bits of memory
  and crossing of page boundaries does not occur.

  INDEXED ABSOLUTE ADDRESSING - (X, Y indexing)-This form of addressing is
  used in conjunction with X and Y index register and is referred to as
  "Absolute, X," and "Absolute, Y." The effective address is formed by
  adding the contents of X and Y to the address contained in the second and
  third bytes of the instruction. This mode allows the index register to
  contain the index or count value and the instruction to contain the base
  address. This type of indexing allows any location referencing and the
  index to modify multiple fields resulting in reduced coding and execution
  time.

  IMPLIED ADDRESSING - In the implied addressing mode, the address
  containing the operand is implicitly stated in the operation code of the
  instruction.

  RELATIVE ADDRESSING - Relative addressing is used only with branch
  instructions and establishes a destination for the conditional branch.

  The second byte of the instruction becomes the operand which is an
  "Offset" added to the contents of the lower eight bits of the program
  counter when the counter is set at the next instruction. The range of the
  offset is -128 to +127 bytes from the next instruction.

  INDEXED INDIRECT ADDRESSING - In indexed indirect addressing (referred to
  as [Indirect, X]), the second byte of the instruction is added to the
  contents of the X index register, discarding the carry. The result of
  this addition points to a memory location on page zero whose contents is
  the low order eight bits of the effective address. The next memory loca-
  tion in page zero contains the high order eight bits of the effective ad-
  dress. Both memory locations specifying the high and low order bytes of
