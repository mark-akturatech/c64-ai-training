# byRiclianll - Initialization sequence: zero-page setup (LDA #*00; STA *7F), a JSR to *C100, and installation of a three-byte JMP vector into *0600..*0602 (values *4C, *C7, *FA) to effect a jump into *FAC7. Also sets up drive/LED via LDA #*E0; STA *03. Includes inline comments indicating DRIVE NUMBER and LED and the jump target.
