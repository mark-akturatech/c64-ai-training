  LINE 40:

    PRINTTAB(160)       Tabs 160 spaces from the top lefthand CHARACTER
                        SPACE on the screen, which is the same as 4 rows
                        beneath the clear command... this starts your PRINT
                        message on the 6th line down on the screen.
    "{white}            Hold down the <CTRL> key and press the key marked
                        <WHT> at the same time. If you do this inside
                        quotation marks, a "reversed E" will appear. This
                        sets the color to everything PRINTed from then on
                        to WHITE.
    I AM THE            This is a simple PRINT statement.
    DANCING
    MOUSE!

    {light blue}        This sets the color back to light blue when the
                        PRINT statement ends. Holding down <C=> and <7>
                        a at the same time inside quotation marks
                        causes a "reversed diamond symbol" to appear.
