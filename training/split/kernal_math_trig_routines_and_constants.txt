# ********* - Kernal floating-point math routines: COS, SIN (57956 $E264 and 57960 $E268), TAN (58036 $E2B4) and associated constant tables for PI/2, 2*PI, 1/4 and SIN/TAN evaluation constants (58080-58095 $E2E0-$E2EF, 58095 contains SINCON table). Also ATN (58126 $E30E) and its constants ATNCON (58174 $E33E) tables. These implement trig and inverse trig via series and table constants.

will cause errors when the overwritten variables are referenced.
Likewise, strings whose text was referenced at its location within the
original program listing will be incorrect.

Since a LOAD from a program causes the program execution to continue
at the first line, when loading a machine language routine or data
file with a nonrelocating load (for example, LOAD"FILE",8,1) from a
program, you should read a flag and GOTO the line after the LOAD if
you don't want the program to keep rerunning indefinitely:

10 IF FLAG=1 THEN GOTO 30
20 FLAG=1:LOAD"FILE",8,1
30 REM PROGRAM CONTINUES HERE

57790         $E1BE          OPEN
Perform OPEN

The BASIC OPEN statement calls the Kernal OPEN routine.

57799         $E1C7          CLOSE
Perform CLOSE

The BASIC CLOSE statement calls the Kernal CLOSE routine.

57812         $E1D4
Set Parameters for LOAD, VERIFY, and SAVE

This routine is used in common by LOAD, SAVE, and VERIFY for setting
the filename, the logical file, device number, and secondary address,
all of which must be done prior to these operations.

57856         $E200
Skip Comma and Get Integer in .X

This subroutine is used to skip the comma between parameters and get
the following integer value in the .X register.

57862         $E206
Fetch Current Character and Check for End of Line

This subroutine gets the current character, and if it is 0 (end of
line), it pulls its own return address off the stack and returns.
This terminates both its own execution and that of the subroutine
which called it.

57870         $E20E
Check for Comma

This subroutine checks for a comma, moves the text pointer past it if
found, and returns an error if it is not found.

57881         $E219
Set Parameters for OPEN and CLOSE

This routine is used in common by OPEN and CLOSE for setting the
filename, the logical file, device number, and secondary address, all
of which must be done prior to these operations.

57956         $E264          COS
Perform COS

COS is executed by adding PI/2 to the contents of FAC1 and dropping
through to SIN.

57960         $E268          SIN
Perform SIN

This routine evaluates the SIN of the number in FAC1 (which represents
the angle in radians), and leaves the result there.

58036         $E2B4          TAN
Perform TAN

This routine evaluates the tangent of the number in FAC1 (which
represents the angle in radians) by dividing its sine by its cosine.

Location Range: 58080-58125 ($E2E0-$E30D)
Table of Constants for Evaluation of SIN, COS, and TAN

58080         $E2E0          PI2
The Five-Byte Floating Point Representation of the Constant PI/2

58085         $E2E5          TWOPI
The Five-Byte Floating Point Representation of the Constant 2*PI

58090         $E2EA          FR4
The Five-Byte Floating Point Representation of the Constant 1/4

58095         $E2EF          SINCON
Table of Constants for Evaluation of SIN, COS, and TAN

This table starts with a counter byte of 5, indicating that there are
six entries in the table.  This is followed by the six floating point
constants of five bytes each.
