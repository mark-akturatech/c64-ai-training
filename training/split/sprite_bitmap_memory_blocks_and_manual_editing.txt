# COMMODORE 64 - Describes how the 63 bytes at addresses 832..894 map to the sprite bitmap: each address represents an 8-pixel block, with three 8-pixel blocks per horizontal row (three bytes per row). Explains the loop (from the example program) that POKEs 255 into each block to make pixels solid, and demonstrates manual editing in DIRECT mode (POKE 833,0 erases the second 8-pixel group; POKE 833,255 or RUN restores it).

    Each number from 832 to 895 in our sprite 0 address represents one
  block of 8 pixels, with three 8-pixel blocks in each horizontal row of
  the sprite. The loop in line 80 tells the computer to POKE 832,255 which
  makes the first 8 pixels solid . . . then POKE 833,255 to make the second
  8 pixels solid, and so on to location 894 which is the last group of 8
  pixels in the bottom right corner of the sprite. To better see how this
  works, try typing the following in DIRECT r-node, and notice that the
  second group of 8 pixels is erased:

    POKE 833,0 (to put it back type POKE 833,255 or RUN your program)
