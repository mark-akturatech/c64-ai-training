# COMMODORE 64 - Concrete examples of OPEN statements demonstrating a variety of devices, addresses, file-names, types, and modes: opening a sequential disk file; tape write with end-of-file marker; keyboard input; screen output; printer output (different device numbers); reading and writing cassette; RS-232 channel; printer uppercase/graphics vs upper/lower case; sending commands to disk. Shows use of file numbers, device numbers, secondary addresses, file-name/type/mode strings, and CHR$(10) for RS-232.



  EXAMPLES of OPEN Statements:


    10 OPEN 2,8,4,"DISK-OUTPUT,SEQ,W"  (Opens sequential file on disk)

    10 OPEN 1,1,2,"TAPE-WRITE"         (Write End-of-File on Close)

    10 OPEN 50,0                       (Keyboard input)

    10 OPEN 12,3                       (Screen output)

    10 OPEN 130,4                      (Printer output)

    10 OPEN 1,1,0,"NAME"               (Read from cassette)

    10 OPEN 1,1,1,"NAME"               (Write to cassette)

    10 OPEN 1,2,0,CHR$(10)             (open channel to RS-232 device)

    10 OPEN 1,4,0,"STRING"             (Send upper case/graphics to
                                        the printer)

    10 OPEN 1,4,7,"STRING"             (Send upper/lower case to
                                        printer)
