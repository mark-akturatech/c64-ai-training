# MACHINE - Example routine that ANDs contents of 100 locations ($17E0-$1844) and a detailed cycle-by-cycle breakdown: instruction counts for LDX, LDA immediate, AND (with page-cross penalties), INX, CPX, BCC, RTS, totaling 1171 cycles (~1.17 ms) and suggestion to add 10% for interrupts and extra cycles for being a subroutine (JSR).

Let's take a simple routine and estimate its timing.  The following program
logically ANDs the contents of 100 locations from $17E0 to $1844:

  033C  LDX #$00
  033E  LDA #$00
  0340  AND $17E0,X
  0343  INX
  0345  CPX #$64
  0347  BCC $0340
  0349  RTS

                                                                        :133:

We may work out timing as follows:

  LDX #$00--executed once:               2

  LDA #$00--executed once:               2

  AND $17E0,X:  32 times at 4 cycles:  128
    68 times at 5 cycles (page cross): 340

  INX--100 times at 2 cycles:          200

  CPX #$64--100 times at 2 cycles:     200

  BCC--99 times at 3 cycles:           297
    1 time at 2 cycles (no branch):      2

  RTS--6 cycles:                         6

Total time:  1171 cycles, or slightly over one thousandth of a second.  We
might add 10 percent to allow for the effects of interrupt; and since this is
a subroutine, we could also add the extra six cycles needed to perform the
JSR.

Where timing is critical, the interrupt could be locked out with SEI.  Be
