# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Increment the active tape buffer pointer/index ($A6) after processing a header or data byte. Uses get_tape_buffer_start_pointer (JSR $F7D0) to load a comparison index into Y, increments $A6 and compares Y with #$C0 (buffer length) to check wrapping/limit.
