# A Minimal C64 Datasette Program Loader - Subroutine get_pulse: waits for pulse start/end via bit testing $DC0D (the tape input port), reads low byte of Timer B ($DD06), restarts Timer B via $DD0F, returns negative length in A and sets the C flag if the pulse was short. Uses LDA/STA/LDX and BIT/BEQ/BNE for timing synchronization.

get_pulse Routine
-----------------

The subroutine measures a pulse by reading the low byte of Timer B and
restarts the timer. It returns the (negative) length in the accumulator
and sets the C flag if it was a short pulse.

    get_pulse:
        lda #$10
    p1: bit $dc0d       ;wait for start
        bne p1          ;of pulse

        ldx #%01011001  ;value to restart timer b
    p2: bit $dc0d       ;wait for end
        beq p2          ;of pulse

        lda $dd06       ;read timer b
        stx $dd0f       ;restart timer b
        cmp #$ff-threshold_short_medium
        rts             ;c=1: short
