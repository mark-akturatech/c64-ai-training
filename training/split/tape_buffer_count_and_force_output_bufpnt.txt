# ********* - Documents BUFPNT ($A6), which counts the number of bytes read into or written to the cassette/tape buffer. Notes that writes wait until the full 192-byte buffer is filled and that output can be forced with POKE 166,191.

Count of Characters in Tape I/O Buffer

This location is used to count the number of bytes that have been read
in or written to the tape buffer.  Since on a tape write, no data is
sent until the 192 byte buffer is full, you can force output of the
buffer with the statement POKE 166,191.
