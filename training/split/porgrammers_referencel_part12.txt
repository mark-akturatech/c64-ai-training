~


    Any characters can be included as data, but if certain ones are used
  the data item must be enclosed by quote marks (" "). These include
  punctuation like comma (,), colon (:), blank spaces, and shifted letters,
  graphics, and cursor control characters.

  EXAMPLES of DATA Statement:

    10 DATA 1,10,5,8
    20 DATA JOHN,PAUL,GEORGE,RINGO
    30 DATA "DEAR MARY, HOW ARE YOU, LOVE, BILL"
    40 DATA -1.7E-9, 3.33



  DEF FN

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: DEF FN <name> ( <variable> ) = <expression>

    Action: This sets up a user-defined function that can be used later in
  the program. The function can consist of any mathematical formula. User-
  defined functions save space in programs where a long formula is used in
  several places. The formula need only be specified once, in the
  definition statement, and then it is abbreviated as a function name. It
  must be executed once, but any subsequent executions are ignored.
    The function name is the letters FN followed by any variable name. This
  can be 1 or 2 characters, the first being a letter and the second a
  letter or digit.

  EXAMPLES of DEF FN Statement:

    10 DEF FN A(X)=X+7
    20 DEF FN AA(X)=Y*Z
    30 DEF FN A9(Q) = INT(RND(1)*Q+1)

    The function is called later in the program by using the function name
  with a variable in parentheses. This function name is used like any other
  variable, and its value is automatically calculated,

  EXAMPLES of FN Use:

    40 PRINT FN A(9)
    50 R=FN AA(9)
    60 G=G+FN A9(10)

    In line 50 above, the number 9 inside the parentheses does not affect
  the outcome of the function, because the function definition in line 20
  doesn't use the variable in the parentheses. The result is Y times Z,
  regardless of the value of X. In the other two functions, the value in
  parentheses does affect the result.


  DIM

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: DIM <variable> ( <subscripts> )[
          <variable> ( <subscripts> )...]


    Action: This statement defines an array or matrix of variables. This
  allows you to use the variable name with a subscript. The subscript
  points to the element being used. The lowest element number in an array
  is zero, and the highest is the number given in the DIM statement, which
  has a maximum of 32767.
    The DIM statement must be executed once and only once for each array.
  A REDIM'D ARRAY error occurs if this line is re-executed. Therefore,
  most programs perform all DIM operations at the very beginning.
    There may be any number of dimensions and 255 subscripts in an array,
  limited only by the amount of RAM memory which is available to hold the
  variables. The array may be mode up of normal numeric variables, as shown
  above, or of strings or integer numbers. If the variables are other than
  normal numeric, use the $ or % signs after the variable name to indicate
  string or integer variables,

    If an array referenced in a program was never DiMensioned, it is
  automatically dimensioned to 11 elements in each dimension used in the
  first reference.

  EXAMPLES of DIM Statement:

    10 DIM A(100)
    20 DIM Z (5,7), Y(3,4,5)
    30 DIM Y7%(Q)
    40 DIM PH$(1000)
    50 F(4)=9 : REM AUTOMATICALLY PERFORMS DIM F(10)

  EXAMPLE of FOOTBALL SCORE-KEEPING Using DIM:

    10 DIM S(1,5), T$(1)
    20 INPUT"TEAM NAMES"; T$(0), T$(1)
    30 FOR Q=1 TO 5: FOR T=0 TO 1
    40 PRINT T$(T),"SCORE IN QUARTER" Q
    50 INPUT S(T,Q): S(T,0)= S(T,0)+ S(T,Q)
    60 NEXT T,Q
    70 PRINT CHR$(147) "SCOREBOARD"
    80 PRINT "QUARTER"
    90 FOR Q= 1 TO 5
   100 PRINT TAB(Q*2+9) Q;
   110 NEXT: PRINT TAB(15) "TOTAL"
   120 FOR T=0 TO 1: PRINT T$(T);
   130 FOR Q= 1 TO 5
   140 PRINT TAB(Q*2+9) S(T,Q);
   150 NEXT: PRINT TAB(15) S(T,0)
   160 NEXT

  CALCULATING MEMORY USED BY DIM:

    5 bytes for the array name
    2 bytes for each dimension
    2 bytes/element for integer variables
    5 bytes/element for normal numeric variables
    3 bytes/element for string variables
    1 byte for each character in each string element

  END

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: END

    Action: This finishes a program's execution and displays the READY
  message, returning control to the person operating the computer. There
  may be any number of END statements within a program. While it is not
  necessary to include any END statements at all, it is recommended that
  a program does conclude with one, rather than just running out of lines.
    The END statement is similar to the STOP statement. The only difference
  is that STOP causes the computer to display the message BREAK IN LINE XX
  and END just displays READY. Both statements allow the computer to resume
  execution by typing the CONT command.

  EXAMPLES of END Statement:

    10 PRINT"DO YOU REALLY WANT TO RUN THIS PROGRAM"
    20 INPUT A$
    30 IF A$ = "NO" THEN END
    40 REM REST OF PROGRAM . . .
    999 END



  EXP

  TYPE: Function-Numeric
  FORMAT: EXP ( <number> )

    Action: This mathematical function calculates the constant e
  (2.71828183) raised to the power of the number given. A value greater
  than 88.0296919 causes an ?OVERFLOW error to occur.

  EXAMPLES of EXP Function:

    10 PRINT EXP (1)
    20 X = Y*EXP (Z*Q)

  FN

  TYPE: Function-Numeric
  FORMAT: FN <name> ( <number> )

    Action: This function references the previously DEFined formula spec-
  ified by name. The number is substituted into its place (if any) and the
  formula is calculated. The result will be a numeric value.
    This function can be used in direct mode, as long as the statement
  DEFining it has been executed.
    If an FN is executed before the DEF statement which defines it, an
  UNDEF'D FUNCTION error occurs.

  EXAMPLES of FN (User-Defined) Function:

    PRINT FN A(Q)
    1100 J = FN J(7)+ FN J(9)
    9990 IF FN B7 (1+1)= 6 THEN END


  FOR ... TO ... [STEP ...

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: FOR <variable> = <start> TO <limit> [ STEP <increment> ]

    Action: This is a special BASIC statement that lets you easily use a
  variable as a counter. You must specify certain parameters: the
  floating-point variable name, its starting value, the limit of the count,
  and how much to add during each cycle.

    Here is a simple BASIC program that counts from 1 to 10, PRINTing
  each number and ENDing when complete, and using no FOR statements:

    100 L = 1
    110 PRINT L
    120 L = 1 + 1
    130 IF L <= 10 THEN 110
    140 END





                                             BASIC LANGUAGE VOCABULARY   47

  Using the FOR statement, here is the same program:

    100 FOR L = 1 TO 10
    110 PRINT L
    120 NEXT L
    130 END

    As you can see, the program is shorter and easier to understand using
  the FOR statement.
    When the FOR statement is executed, several operations take place.
  The <start> value is placed in the <variable> being used in the
  counter. In the example above, a I is placed in L.
    When the NEXT statement is reached, the <increment> value is added to
  the <variable>. If a STEP was not included, the <increment> is set to
  + 1. The first time the program above hits line 120, 1 is added to L,
  so the new value of L is 2.
    Now the value in the <variable> is compared to the <limit>. If the
  <limit> has not been reached yet, the program G0es TO the line after
  the original FOR statement. In this case, the value of 2 in L is less
  than the limit of 10, so it GOes TO line 110.
    Eventually, the value of <limit> is exceeded by the <variable>. At
  that time, the loop is concluded and the program continues with the line
  following the NEXT statement. In our example, the value of L reaches
  11, which exceeds the limit of 10, and the program goes on with line
  130.
    When the value of <increment> is positive, the <variable> must
  exceed the <limit>, and when it is negative it must become less than
  the <limit>.

  | NOTE: A loop always executes at least once. |

  EXAMPLES of FOR...TO...STEP...Statement:

    100 FOR L = 100 TO 0 STEP -1
    100 FOR L = PI TO 6* {pi} STEP .01
    100 FOR AA = 3 TO 3
