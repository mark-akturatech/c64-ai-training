# - C64 RAM Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $0299-$029A BAUDOF: prescaler (time required to send a bit) used by CIA #2 timers A and B to cause NMI-driven RS-232 routines. Gives CLOCK values (NTSC 1,022,730 Hz; PAL 985,250 Hz) and prescaler formula PRESCALER = ((CLOCK/BAUDRATE)/2) - 100. Mentions tables of NTSC prescaler values at $FEC2 (65218) and PAL at $E4EC (58604).

$0299-$029A  BAUDOF  Time Required to Send a Bit
                     
                     This location holds the prescaler value used by CIA #2 timers A and B.
                     
                     These timers cause an NMI interrupt to drive the RS-232 receive and
                     transmit routines CLOCK/PRESCALER times per second each, where CLOCK
                     is the system 02 frequency of 1,022,730 Hz (985,250 if you are using
                     the European PAL television standard rather than the American NTSC
                     standard), and PRESCALER is the value stored at 56580-1 ($DD04-5) and
                     56582-3 ($DD06-7), in low-byte, high-byte order.  You can use the
                     following formula to figure the correct prescaler value for a
                     particular RS-232 baud rate:
                     
                     PRESCALER=((CLOCK/BAUDRATE)/2)-100
                     
                     The American (NTSC standard) prescaler values for the standard RS-232
                     baud rates which the control register at 659 ($0293) makes available
                     are stored in a table at 65218 ($FEC2), starting with the two-byte
                     value used for 50 baud.  The European (PAL standard) version of that
                     table is located at 58604 ($E4EC).
