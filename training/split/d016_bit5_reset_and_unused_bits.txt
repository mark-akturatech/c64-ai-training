# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - D016 Bit 5: VIC-II chip reset (1=video off); recommended to keep 0 for normal operation. Bits 6-7 unused.

                          Bit 5:  Bit 5 controls the VIC-II chip Reset line.  Setting this bit
                          to 1 will completely stop the video chip from operating.  On older
                          64s, the screen will go black.  It should always be set to 0 to insure
                          normal operation of the chip.

                          Bits 6 and 7.  These bits are not used.
