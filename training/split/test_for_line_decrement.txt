# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Routine that tests whether the cursor should move to the previous line when decrementing. Compares provided column with the cursor column and, if at line start, decrements the cursor row. Otherwise performs two iterations of adding one line length (ADC #$28) to test crossing line boundaries and returns.
