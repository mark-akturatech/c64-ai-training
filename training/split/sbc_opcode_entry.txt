# NMOS 6510 - Undocumented opcode $EB: SBC #imm. Documents opcode type as a combination of immediate and implied commands, mnemonic SBC #imm, function A = A - #{imm}, size 2 bytes, cycles and flags affected (mentions N V - B D I Z and carry behaviour). Notes it operates like the regular SBC immediate and references test code (Lorenz-2.15/sbcb-eb.prg).
