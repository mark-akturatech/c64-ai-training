# Kick Assembler - List of CmdValue argument type constants and examples: AT_ABSOLUTE, AT_ABSOLUTEX, AT_ABSOLUTEY, AT_IMMEDIATE, AT_INDIRECT, AT_IZEROPAGEX, AT_IZEROPAGEY, and AT_NONE. Note that some addressing modes (absolute zeropage and relative) are omitted because the assembler infers them from absolute modes.

The argument type constants are the following:

Table 7.2. Argument Type Constants
Constant

Example

AT_ABSOLUTE

$1000

AT_ABSOLUTEX

$1000,x

AT_ABSOLUTEY

$1000,y

AT_IMMEDIATE

#10

AT_INDIRECT

($1000)

AT_IZEROPAGEX

($10,x)

AT_IZEROPAGEY

($10),y

AT_NONE
Some addressing modes, like absolute zeropage and relative, are missing from the above table. This is because
the assembler automatically detect when these should be used from the corresponding absolute mode.
