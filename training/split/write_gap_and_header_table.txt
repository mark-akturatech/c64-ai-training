# byRiclianll - Writes gap/header table bytes into the buffer at offsets around $0300. Includes STA/INX sequences, references to the '*0300,X' buffer area (gap region), and preparation of a zero value (LDA #*00) before checksum computation. This section is the tail-gap/header area setup used prior to checksum calculation.
