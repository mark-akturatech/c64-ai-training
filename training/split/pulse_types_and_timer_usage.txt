# A Minimal C64 Datasette Program Loader - Pulse types and measurement principle: three pulse durations (Short 352µs, Medium 512µs, Long 672µs). Measurement performed using CIA timers which count down PAL clock cycles; Timer A underflows counted by Timer B for extended range.

All information is encoded in the duration of pulses. There are three types
of pulses:

  Short:  352 microseconds
  Medium: 512 microseconds
  Long:   672 microseconds

To measure the lengths of the pulses, we can use one of the timers in the
CIA chips: These count cycles of the C64 base clock (roughly microseconds),
counting down from a 16 bit start value.
