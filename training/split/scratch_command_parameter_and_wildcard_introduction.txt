# byRiclianll - Explains that the scratch command requires a single parameter (the file name, preceded by S or SCRATCH) and introduces wildcards in file names: asterisk (*) and question mark (?). Warns to use wildcards with extreme caution because multiple files may be affected. Begins an example showing use of the asterisk wildcard (files beginning with a given letter).


The  scratch  command  requires  a  single  parameter,  the  file  name,  preceded  by  S  or 
SCRATCH.  As  before,  the  drive  number  is  optional. 

There  are  some  variations  that  incorporate  wild  cards.  Wild  cards  in  a  file  name  are 
asterisks  (*)  or  question  marks  (?).  They  should  be  used  with  utmost  caution  since  more 
than  one  file  can  be  scratched  at  a  time. 

EXAMPLE:    OPEN    15,    8,  15 

PRINT#15,  "SO:T»" 
CLOSE  15 


DOS  5.1:    >S0 : T*
