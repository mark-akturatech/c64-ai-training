# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - TKSA: SEND TALK SECONDARY ADDRESS. KERNAL TKSA ($FF96) vector: A holds the secondary address which is stored in the serial buffer BSOUR ($95) and sent to the bus via JSR $ED36 (handshake/send). The routine then falls through to the routines that wait for the clock and clear ATN as needed.

                                *** TKSA: SEND TALK SA
                                The KERNAL routine TKSA ($ff96) is vectored here. On
                                entry, (A) holds the secondary address. This is placed in
                                the serial buffer and sent out to the serial bus "under
                                attention". The routine drops through to the next routine
                                to wait for CLK and clear ATN.
