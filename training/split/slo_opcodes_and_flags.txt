# NMOS 6510 - SLO (also called ASO) undocumented opcode: opcode-level specification and encodings. Covers the low-level function lines ({addr} = {addr} * 2 and A = A OR {addr}), size/cycle/flags header, and the opcode encodings for various addressing modes as printed in the table (including entries for SLO zp,x; SLO (zp,x); SLO (zp),y; SLO abs; SLO abs,x; SLO abs,y with their listed sizes, cycle counts, and opcode bytes such as $03, $13, $0F, $1F, $1B).
