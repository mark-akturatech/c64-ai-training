# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Sprites: there are eight sprites 0-7; each 24x21 dots; shapes come from 63 bytes within a 64-byte block. Sprite Data Pointers (last eight bytes of screen memory, default $7F8-$7FF / 2040-2047) select which 64-byte block (pointer * 64 = block start) within VIC-II's 16K window provides sprite shape data.

                          graphics.

                          Sprite graphics takes its name from the graphics characters it
                          displays, each of which is called a sprite.  There are eight sprites,
                          known as Sprites 0-7.  Each sprite character is 24 dots wide by 21
                          dots high.  This is about eight times as large as a regular text
                          character, which is only 8 dots wide by 8 dots high.

                          A sprite takes its shape from 63 bytes of data in one of the 256 data
                          blocks, each 64 bytes long, that can fit into the 16K space which the
                          VIC-II chip can address.  The block currently assigned to any given
                          sprite is determined by the Sprite Data Pointers, which are located at
                          the last eight bytes of the screen memory area (the default locations
                          are 2040-2047, $7F8-$7FF).

                          The first Sprite Data Pointer determines the data block used for the
                          shape of Sprite 0, the second for the shape of Sprite 1, etc.  The
                          number in the pointer times 64 equals the address of the first byte of
                          the data block within the VIC-II addressing range.

                          For example, using the default values for VIC-II addressing area and
                          screen memory, a value of 11 in location 2040 ($7F8) would mean that
                          the shape of Sprite0 is determined by the data in the 63-byte block
                          starting at location 704 (11*64).  It should be noted that it is
                          possible for more than one sprite to take its shape data from the same
                          block, so that only 64 bytes of data are required to create eight
                          sprites, each having the same shape.
