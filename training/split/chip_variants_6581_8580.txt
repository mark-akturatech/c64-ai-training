2. CHIP VARIANTS: 6581 vs 8580
================================================================================

+------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------+
| Feature          | MOS 6581                  | MOS 8580 (R5)             |
+------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------+
| Production       | 1982-1987                 | 1987-1993                 |
| Process          | NMOS                      | HMOS-II                   |
| Supply Voltage   | +12V (Vdd)                | +9V (Vdd)                 |
| Filter Caps      | 470 pF (CAP1A/B, CAP2A/B)| 22 nF (CAP1A/B, CAP2A/B) |
| Filter Sound     | Darker, "grittier"        | Brighter, cleaner         |
| DC Offset        | Present in audio output   | Minimal DC offset         |
| Digi Playback    | 4-bit via volume register | "Fixed" - requires HW mod |
|                  | (unintended "bug")        | (resistor on EXT IN pin)  |
| Audio Output     | 6V DC bias, 3Vp-p max    | Lower DC bias             |

Sub-revisions of the 6581:
  - 6581 R1/R2: Original production (1982-1983)
  - 6581 R3: Most common revision (1983-1985)
  - 6581 R4AR: Late revision (1985-1987)

The 8580 "fixed" a design characteristic in the 6581 where changing the master
volume register caused an audible click proportional to the volume change. This
"bug" was exploited by programmers to play 4-bit digitized samples by rapidly
writing sample values to the volume register. On the 8580, this technique
produces barely audible output unless a ~330k ohm resistor is connected between
the EXT IN pin and ground.
