# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $D41C — ENV3: reads envelope generator output of voice 3. Can be used for modulation of other parameters (freq, pulse width, filter cutoff). Requires gate bit of Control Register 3 to be set to 1 to produce output; ADSR controls how ENV3 changes.

$D41C        ENV3         Envelope Generator 3 Output

                          This register allows you to read the output of the voice 3 Envelope
                          generator, in much the same way that the preceding register lets you
                          read the output of Oscillator 3.  This output can also be added to
                          another oscillator's Frequency Control Registers, Pulse Width
                          Registers, or the Filter Frequency Control Register.  In order to
                          produce any output from this register, however, the gate bit in
                          Control Register 3 must be set to 1.  Just as in the production of
                          sound, setting the gate bit to 1 starts the attack/decay/sustain
                          cycle, and setting it back to 0 starts the release cycle.
