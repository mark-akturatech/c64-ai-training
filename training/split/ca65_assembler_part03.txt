# CA65 Assembler - Command Line Options (continued)

-mm model, --memory-model model
Define the default memory model. Possible model specifiers are near, far and huge.


--no-utf8
Disable the use of UTF-8 characters in diagnostics. This might be necessary if auto detection fails or if the output is captured for processing with a tool that is not UTF-8 capable.


-o name
The default output name is the name of the input file with the extension replaced by ".o". If you don't like that, you may give another name with the -o option. The output file will be placed in the same directory as the source file, or, if -o is given, the full path in this name is used.


--pagelength n
sets the length of a listing page in lines. See the .PAGELENGTH directive for more information.


--relax-checks
Disables some error checks done by the assembler. This will allow code that is an error in most cases and flagged as such by the assembler, but can be valid in special situations.

Disabled checks are:

Address vs. fragment size: a byte sized load from an non-zeropage address is truncated instead of producing an error.
Indirect jump on page boundary: jmp (label) on a label that resides on a page boundary ($xxFF) fetches the second byte from the wrong address on 6502 CPUs, now allowed instead of producing an error.

-S, --segment-list
Add the segment ID in front of each address in the listing file.


-s, --smart-mode
In smart mode (enabled by -s or the .SMART pseudo instruction) the assembler will track usage of the REP and SEP instructions in 65816 mode and update the operand sizes accordingly. If the operand of such an instruction cannot be evaluated by the assembler (for example, because the operand is an imported symbol), a warning is issued.

Beware: Since the assembler cannot trace the execution flow this may lead to false results in some cases. If in doubt, use the .ixx and .axx instructions to tell the assembler about the current settings. Smart mode is off by default.


-t sys, --target sys
Set the target system. This will enable translation of character strings and character constants into the character set of the target platform. The default for the target system is "none", which means that no translation will take place. The assembler supports the same target systems as the compiler, see there for a list.

Depending on the target, the default CPU type is also set. This can be overridden by using the --cpu option.


-U, --auto-import
Mark symbols that are not defined in the sources as imported symbols. This should be used with care since it delays error messages about typos and such until the linker is run. The compiler uses the equivalent of this switch ( .AUTOIMPORT) to enable auto imported symbols for the runtime library. However, the compiler is supposed to generate code that runs through the assembler without problems, something which is not always true for assembler programmers.


-v, --verbose
Increase the assembler verbosity. Usually only needed for debugging purposes. You may use this option more than one time for even more verbose output.


-V, --version
Print the version number of the assembler. If you send any suggestions or bugfixes, please include the version number.


-Wn
Set the warning level for the assembler. Using -W2 the assembler will even warn about such things like unused imported symbols. The default warning level is 1, and it would probably be silly to set it to something lower.


--warn-align-waste
Warnings will be generated when alignment requirements cause emission of fill bytes.


--warnings-as-errors
An error will be generated if any warnings were produced.


-x, --expand-macros
In the listing file, show exactly how macros were expanded. Use twice for more verbose output.
