# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - RESTOR: KERNAL RESET (vector $ff8a). Copies KERNAL vectors from $FD30 table into RAM locations $0314-$0333 (or sets them depending on carry). Uses VECTOR helper ($FD1A) to perform the move, storing MEMUSS into $C3/$C4 for temporary use. Resets carry handling before calling VECTOR.

                                *** RESTOR: KERNAL RESET
                                The KERNAL routine RESTOR ($ff8a) jumps to this routine.
                                It restores (copies) the KERNAL vectors at $fd30 to $0314-
                                $0333. Continues through VECTOR.
