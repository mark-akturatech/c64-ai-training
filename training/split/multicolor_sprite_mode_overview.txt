# Contents - Explains the effect of enabling/disabling sprite multicolor mode: horizontal resolution halved (24 -> 12 pixels), each pair of bits in a sprite definition selects one of four colors, and refers to a mapping table for bit-pair to color-register relationship.




disable the multicolor mode. When the multicolor 
mode is enabled, the horizontal resolution drops 
from 24 pixels across to 12 pixels. Each pair of bits 
in the sprite definition is treated as a bit pair, whose 
value determines which of the four colors will be 
selected for the pixel. Table 7-4 shows the relation- 
ship between the bit pairs and the color registers.
