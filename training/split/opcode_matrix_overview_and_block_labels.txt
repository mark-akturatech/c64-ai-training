# NMOS 6510 - Introductory explanation of arranging the 6502 opcode matrix to expose symmetries; labels the major blocks used in the matrix: A (Control Instructions + Load/Store Y) and B (ALU Operations + Load/Store A).

opcodes simultaneously trigger parts of the ROM that were intended for completely unrelated
instructions.
If we arrange the opcode matrix in a slightly different way than it is usually done, we can show
some interesting symmetries:
A: Control Instructions + Load/Store Y

B: ALU Operations + Load/Store A
