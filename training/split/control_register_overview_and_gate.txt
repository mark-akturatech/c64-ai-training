# COMMODORE 64 - CONTROL REGISTER (Register 04) overview and GATE (Bit 0): States that the register contains eight control bits selecting options for Oscillator 1. GATE (Bit 0) controls the Voice 1 Envelope Generator: setting starts the ATTACK/DECAY/SUSTAIN cycle, clearing starts RELEASE; envelope controls oscillator amplitude so GATE must be set (with envelope parameters) for audible output. Notes that a detailed Envelope Generator discussion appears later in the appendix.


    This register contains eight control bits which select various options
  on Oscillator 1.
    GATE (Bit 0): The GATE bit controls the Envelope Generator for Voice 1.
  When this bit is set to a one, the Envelope Generator is Gated
  (triggered) and the ATTACK/DECAY/SUSTAIN cycle is initiated. When the bit
  is reset to a zero, the RELEASE cycle begins. The Envelope Generator
  controls the amplitude of Oscillator I appearing at the audio output,
  therefore, the GATE bit must be set (along with suitable envelope pa-
  rameters) for the selected output of Oscillator 1 to be audible. A de-
  tailed discussion of the Envelope Generator can be found at the end of
  this Appendix.
