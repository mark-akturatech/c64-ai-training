# ca65 Users Guide - .ASIZE: returns the current Accumulator size in bits. For the 65816 instruction set it returns 8 or 16 depending on the current accumulator operand size; for other CPU instruction sets it always returns 8. Includes an example macro (rsb) that branches on .ASIZE to select appropriate immediate operand sizes. See also .ISIZE.

9.2 .ASIZE
Reading this pseudo variable will return the current size of the Accumulator in bits.

For the 65816 instruction set .ASIZE will return either 8 or 16, depending on the current size of the operand in immediate accu addressing mode.

For all other CPU instruction sets, .ASIZE will always return 8.

Example:


        ; Reverse Subtract with Accumulator
        ; A = memory - A
        .macro rsb param
                .if .asize = 8
                        eor     #$ff
                .else
                        eor     #$ffff
                .endif
                sec
                adc     param
        .endmacro
