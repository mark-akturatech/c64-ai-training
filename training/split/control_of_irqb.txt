# MACHINE - Control of /IRQB specifics: mirrors /IRQA control. CRB bit 7 set by CB1 active transition; interrupting controlled by CRB bit 0. CRB bit 6 set by CB2 active transition; interrupting controlled by CRB bit 3. Bits 6/7 in CRB are reset by 'Read Peripheral B Output Register' operation.

Control of /IRQB
----------------

Control of /IRQB is performed in exactly the same manner as that described
above for /IRQA.  Bit 7 in CRB is set by an active transition on CB1;
interrupting from this flag is controlled by CRB bit 0.  Likewise, bit 6 in
CRB is set by an active transition on CB2; interrupting from this flag is
controlled by CRB bit 3.

Also, both bit 6 and bit 7 are reset by a "Read Peripheral B Output Register"
operation.
