# COMMODORE 64 - Continuation of the Commodore-64 BASIC error-message list with causes: covers LOAD, NEXT WITHOUT FOR, NOT INPUT FILE, NOT OUTPUT FILE, OUT OF DATA, OUT OF MEMORY, OVERFLOW, REDIM'D ARRAY, REDO FROM START, RETURN WITHOUT GOSUB, STRING TOO LONG, ?SYNTAX ERROR, TYPE MISMATCH, UNDEF'D FUNCTION, UNDEF'D STATEMENT, and VERIFY; explains typical reasons each error appears and suggested checks or corrections.

  LOAD                There is a problem with the program on tape.
  NEXT WITHOUT FOR    This is caused by either incorrectly nesting loops or
                      having a variable name in a NEXT statement that
                      doesn't correspond with one in a FOR statement.
  NOT INPUT FILE      An attempt was made to INPUT or GET data from a file
                      which was specified to be for output only.
  NOT OUTPUT FILE     An attempt was mode to PRINT data to a file which was
                      specified as input only.
  OUT OF DATA         A READ statement was executed but there is no data
                      left unREAD in a DATA statement.
  OUT OF MEMORY       There is no more RAM available for program or
                      variables. This may also occur when too many FOR
                      loops have been nested, or when there are too many
                      GOSUBs in effect.
  OVERFLOW            The result of a computation is larger than the
                      largest number allowed, which is 1.70141884E+38.
  REDIM'D ARRAY       An array may only be DiMensioned once. If an array
                      variable is used before that array is DIM'D, an
                      automatic DIM operation is performed on that array
                      setting the number of elements to ten, and any
                      subsequent DIMs will cause this error.
  REDO FROM START     Character data was typed in during an INPUT statement
                      when numeric data was expected. Just re-type the
                      entry so that it is correct, and the program will
                      continue by itself.
  RETURN WITHOUT GOSUB  A RETURN statement was encountered, and no GOSUB
                      command has been issued.
  STRING TOO LONG     A string can contain up to 255 characters.
  ?SYNTAX ERROR       A statement is unrecognizable by the Commodore 64. A
                      missing or extra parenthesis, misspelled keywords,
                      etc.
  TYPE MISMATCH       This error occurs when a number is used in place of a
                      string, or vice-versa.
  UNDEF'D FUNCTION    A user defined function was referenced, but it has
                      never been defined using the DEF FN statement.
  UNDEF'D STATEMENT   An attempt was made to GOTO or GOSUB or RUN a line
                      number that doesn't exist.
  VERIFY              The program on tape or disk does not match the
                      program currently in memory.
