# - C64 RAM Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $032E-$032F USRCMD: vector to user-defined command (currently points to BRK at $FE66 / 65126). Historical holdover from PET; originally used by machine monitor to jump through USRCMD for unknown commands. Although VECTOR routine updates it, it doesn't seem to facilitate adding new commands in this system.

$032E-$032F  USRCMD  Vector to User-Defined Command (Currently Points to BRK at 65126
                     ($FE66))
                     
                     This appears to be a holdover from PET days, when the built-in machine
                     language monitor would JuMP through the USRCMD vector when it
                     encountered a command that it did not understand, allowing the user to
                     add new commands to the monitor.
                     
                     Although this vector is initialized to point to the routine called by
                     STOP/ RESTORE and the BRK interrupt, and is updated by the Kernal
                     VECTOR routine (64794, $FD1A), it does not seem to have the function
                     of aiding in the addition of new commands.
