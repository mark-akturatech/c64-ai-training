# C64 KERNAL API (Lee Davison) - $FFC0 — Open a logical file. Creates logical file used by I/O routines. Requires prior calls to SETLFS ($FFBA) and SETNAM ($FFBD). No other arguments required; OPEN sets up file table entries and device handshake where necessary.

$FFC0          open a logical file
               
               This routine is used to open a logical file. Once the logical file is set up it
               can be used for input/output operations. Most of the I/O KERNAL routines call on
               this routine to create the logical files to operate on. No arguments need to be
               set up to use this routine, but both the SETLFS, $FFBA, and SETNAM, $FFBD,
               KERNAL routines must be called before using this routine.
