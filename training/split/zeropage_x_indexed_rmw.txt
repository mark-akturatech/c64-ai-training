# NMOS 6510 - Zero-page X indexed (R-M-W) timing: ASL/DEC/INC/ISC/LSR/ROL/ROR/RRA etc on zp,X. Shows the per-cycle sequence including dummy fetch from direct offset before the index was added, then reads/writes at DO+X, and unmodified data write-back before final write. Notes dummy fetch and unmodified write-back semantics.
