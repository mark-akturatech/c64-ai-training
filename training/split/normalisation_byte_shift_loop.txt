# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Normalize FAC1 by shifting mantissa bytes left into position: move mantissa2->1, 3->2, 4->3, rounding->4; clear rounding byte; increment exponent offset by $08 each iteration and loop until offset reaches $20 (max). If exponent reaches zero as part of normalization, clear exponent/sign and return (RTS).
