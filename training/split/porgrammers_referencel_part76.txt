  to be read, there is no carry problem and the register can be read "on
  the fly," provided that any read of Hours is followed by a read of 10ths
  of seconds to disable the latching.

  Serial Port (SDR)

    The serial port is a buffered, 8-bit synchronous shift register system.
  A control bit selects input or output mode. In input mode, data on the SP
  pin is shifted into the shift register on the rising edge of the signal
  applied to the CNT pin. After 8 CNT pulses, the data in the shift
  register is dumped into the Serial Data Register and an interrupt is
  generated. In the output mode, TIMER A is used for the baud rate
  generator. Data is shifted out on the SP pin at 1/2 the underflow rate of
  TIMER A. The maximum baud rate possible is 02 divided by 4, but the
  maximum useable baud rate will be determined by line loading and the
  speed at which the receiver responds to input data. Transmission will
  start following a write to the Serial Data Register (provided TIMER A is
  running and in continuous mode). The clock signal derived from TIMER A
  appears as an output on the CNT pin. The data in the Serial Data Register
  will be loaded into the shift register then shift out to the SP pin when
  a CNT pulse occurs. Data shifted out becomes valid on the falling edge of
  CNT and remains valid until the next falling edge. After 8 CNT pulses, an

  interrupt is generated to indicate more data can be sent. If the Serial
  Data Register was loaded with new information prior to this interrupt,
  the new data will automatically be loaded into the shift register and
  transmission will continue. If the microprocessor stays one byte ahead of
  the shift register, transmission will be continuous. If no further data
  is to be transmitted, after the 8th CNT pulse, CNT will return high and
  SP will remain at the level of the last data bit transmitted. SDR data is
  shifted out MSB first and serial input data should also appear in this
  format.
    The bidirectional capability of the Serial Port and CNT clock allows
  many 6526 devices to be connected to a common serial communication bus on
  which one 6526 acts as a master, sourcing data and shift clock, while all
  other 6526 chips act as slaves. Both CNT and SP outputs are open drain to
  allow such a common bus. Protocol for master/slave selection can be
  transmitted over the serial bus, or via dedicated handshaking lines.

  Interrupt Control (ICR)

    There are five sources of interrupts on the 6526: underflow from TIMER
  A, underflow from TIMER B, TOD ALARM, Serial Port full/empty and /FLAG.
  A single register provides masking and interrupt information. The
  interrupt Control Register consists of a write-only MASK register and a
  read-only DATA register. Any interrupt will set the corresponding bit in
  the DATA register. Any interrupt which is enabled by the MASK register
  will set the IR bit (MSB) of the DATA register and bring the /IRQ pin
  low. In a multi-chip system, the IR bit can be polled to detect which
  chip has generated an interrupt request. The interrupt DATA register is
  cleared and the /IRQ line returns high following a read of the DATA
  register. Since each interrupt sets an interrupt bit regardless of the
  MASK, and each interrupt bit can be selectively masked to prevent the
  generation of a processor interrupt, it is possible to intermix polled
  interrupts with true interrupts. However, polling the IR bit will cause
  the DATA register to clear, therefore, it is up to the user to preserve
  the information contained in the DATA register if any polled interrupts
  were present.
    The MASK register provides convenient control of individual mask bits.
  When writing to the MASK register, if bit 7 (SET/CLEAR) of the data

                                                           APPENDIX M   433

  written is a ZERO, any mask bit written with a one will be cleared, while
  those mask bits written with a zero will be unaffected. If bit 7 of the
  data written is a ONE, any mask bit written with a one will be set, while
  those mask bits written with a zero will be unaffected. In order for an
  interrupt flag to set IR and generate an Interrupt Request, the corre-
  sponding MASK bit must be set.

  CONTROL REGISTERS

    There are two control registers in the 6526, CRA and CRB. CRA is
  associated with TIMER A and CRB is associated with TIMER B. The register
  format is as follows:

  CRA:
  Bit  Name    Function
   0  START    1=START TIMER A, 0=STOP TIMER A. This bit is automatically
               reset when underflow occurs during one-shot mode.
   1  PBON     1=TIMER A output appears on PB6, 0=PB6 normal operation.

   2  OUTMODE  1=TOGGLE, 0=PULSE
   3  RUNMODE  1=ONE-SHOT, 0=CONTINUOUS
   4  LOAD     1=FORCE LOAD (this is a STROBE input, there is no data
               storage, bit 4 will always read back a zero and writing a
               zero has no effect).
   5  INMODE   1=TIMER A counts positive CNT transitions, 0=TIMER A counts
               02 pulses.
   6  SPMODE   1=SERIAL PORT output (CNT sources shift clock),
               0=SERIAL PORT input (external shift clock required).
   7  TODIN    1=50 Hz clock required on TOD pin for accurate time,
               0=60 Hz clock required on TOD pin for accurate time.

               (Bits CRB0-CRB4 are identical to CRA0-CRA4 for TIMER B with
               the exception that bit 1 controls the output of TIMER B on
               PB7).
  5,6 INMODE   Bits CRB5 and CRB6 select one of four input modes for
               TIMER B as:
               CRB6   CRB5
                0      0       TIMER B counts 02 pulses.
                0      1       TIMER B counts positive CNT transistions.
                1      0       TIMER B counts TIMER A underflow pulses.
                1      1       TIMER B counts TIMER A underflow pulses
                               while CNT is high.
  7   ALARM     1=writing to TOD registers sets ALARM, 0=writing to TOD
                registers sets TOD clock.

  APPENDIX N

  6566/6567 (VIC-II) CHIP
  SPECIFICATIONS



    The 6566/6567 are multi-purpose color video controller devices for use
  in both computer video terminals and video game applications. Both
  devices contain 47 control registers which are accessed via a standard
  8-bit microprocessor bus (65XX) and will access up to 16K of memory for
  display information. The various operating modes and options within each
  mode are described.



  CHARACTER DISPLAY MODE

    In the character display mode, the 6566/6567 fetches CHARACTER POINTERs
  from the VIDEO MATRIX area of memory and translates the pointers to
  character dot location addresses in the 2048 byte CHARACTER BASE area of
  memory. The video matrix is comprised of 1000 consecutive locations in
  memory which each contain an eight-bit character pointer. The location of
  the video matrix within memory is defined by VM13-VM10 in register 24
  ($18) which are used as the 4 MSB of the video matrix address. The lower
  order 10 bits are provided by an internal counter (VC9-VC0) which steps
  through the 1000 character locations. Note that the 6566/6567 provides 14
  address outputs; therefore, additional system hardware may be required
  for complete system memory decodes.

    The eight-bit character pointer permits up to 256 different character
  definitions to be available simultaneously. Each character is an 8*8 dot
  matrix stored in the character base as eight consecutive bytes. The loca-
  tion of the character base is defined by CB13-CB11 also in register 24
  ($18) which are used for the 3 most significant bits (MSB) of the char-
  acter base address. The 11 lower order addresses are formed by the 8-bit
  character pointer from the video matrix (D7-D0) which selects a
  particular character, and a 3-bit raster counter (RC2-RC0) which selects
  one of the eight character bytes. The resulting characters are formatted
  as 25 rows of 40 characters each. In addition to the 8-bit character
  pointer, a 4-bit COLOR NYBBLE is associated with each video matrix
  location (the video matrix memory must be 12 bits wide) which defines one
  of sixteen colors for each character.

  STANDARD CHARACTER MODE (MCM = BMM = ECM = 0)

    In the standard character mode, the 8 sequential bytes from the
  character base are displayed directly on the 8 lines in each character
  region. A "0" bit causes the background #0 color (from register 33 ($21))
  to be displayed while the color selected by the color nybble (foreground)
  is displayed for a "1" bit (see Color Code Table).

                | CHARACTER |
     FUNCTION   |    BIT    |               COLOR DISPLAYED
  --------------+-----------+----------------------------------------------
    Background  |     0     |  Background #0 color
                |           |  (register 33 ($21)
    Foreground  |     1     |  Color selected by 4-bit color nybble


    Therefore, each character has a unique color determined by the 4-bit
  color nybble (1 of 16) and all characters share the common background
  color.


                                                           APPENDIX N   437
~


  MULTI-COLOR CHARACTER MODE (MCM = 1, BMM = ECM = 0 )

    Multi-color mode provides additional color flexibility allowing up to
  four colors within each character but with reduced resolution. The multi-
  color mode is selected by setting the MCM bit in register 22 ($16) to
  "1," which causes the dot data stored in the character base to be
  interpreted in a different manner. If the MSB of the color nybble is a
  "0," the character will be displayed as described in standard character
  mode, allowing the two modes to be inter-mixed (however, only the lower
  order 8 colors are available). When the MSB of the color nybble is a "1"
  (if MCM:MSB(CM) = 1) the character bits are interpreted in the multi-
  color mode:
