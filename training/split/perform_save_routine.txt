# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - BASIC SAVE implementation: call the shared parameter parser for LOAD/SAVE, take the start and end addresses from BASIC variables/index bytes and call the KERNAL save routine ($FFD8) to write RAM to device; branch to BASIC I/O error handler on error, otherwise RTS. (Includes LDX/LDY loads of start/end address bytes and the JSR $FFD8 call.)
