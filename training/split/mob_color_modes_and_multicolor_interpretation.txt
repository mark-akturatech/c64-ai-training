# COMMODORE 64 - Covers MOB color registers (per-MOB 4-bit color) and the two MOB color modes: Standard MOB (MnMC=0) where '1' bits show the MOB color and '0' bits are transparent, and Multi-color MOB (MnMC=1) where data is interpreted in bit pairs. Provides the multi-color bit-pair table showing interpretation: 00=Transparent, 01=MOB Multi-color #0 (register 37 $25), 10=MOB Color (registers 39–46 $27–$2E), 11=MOB Multi-color #1 (register 38 $26). Explains that multi-color mode reduces horizontal resolution to 12×21 (each horizontal dot expanded 2×) and that up to three colors (plus transparency) are available, with two multi-colors shared among all MOBs.

  COLOR

    Each MOB has a separate 4-bit register to determine the MOB color. The
  two MOB color modes are:

  STANDARD MOB (MnMC = 0)

    In the standard mode, a "0" bit of MOB data allows any background data
  to show through (transparent) and a "1" bit is displayed as the MOB color
  determined by the corresponding MOB Color register.

  MULTI-COLOR MOB (MnMC = 1)

    Each MOB can be individually selected as a multi-color MOB via MnMC
  bits in the MOB Multi-color register 28 ($1C). When the MnMC bit is "1",
  the corresponding MOB is displayed in the multi-color mode. In the multi-
  color mode, the MOB data is interpreted in pairs (similar to the other
  multi-color modes) as follows:

        BIT PAIR      |                   COLOR DISPLAYED
  --------------------+----------------------------------------------------
           00         |  Transparent
           01         |  MOB Multi-color #0 (register 37 ($25))
           10         |  MOB Color (registers 39-46 ($27-$2E))
           11         |  MOB Multi-color #1 (register 38 ($26))


  Since two bits of data are required for each color, the resolution of the
  MOB is reduced to 12X21, with each horizontal dot expanded to twice
  standard size so that the overall MOB size does not change. Note that up
  to 3 colors can be displayed in each MOB (in addition to transparent) but
  that two of the colors are shared among all the MOBs in the multi-color
  mode.
