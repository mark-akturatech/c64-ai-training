# MACHINE - Two-step example for printing one character with CHROUT: load ASCII code into A (e.g., LDA #$58 for 'X') then JSR $FFD2 to call CHROUT.

To print a letter X on the screen, we would need to follow these steps:

  1.  Bring the ASCII letter X ($58) into the A register.

  2.  JSR to address $FFD2
