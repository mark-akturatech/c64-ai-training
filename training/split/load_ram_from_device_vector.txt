# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Kernal entry that sets up the KERNAL 'setup pointer' (stores X/Y into $C3/$C4) and then jumps through the LOAD vector at $0330. This indirection usually transfers control to the actual LOAD implementation in the ROM.

                                *** load RAM from a device
.,F49E 86 C3    STX $C3         set kernal setup pointer low byte
.,F4A0 84 C4    STY $C4         set kernal setup pointer high byte
.,F4A2 6C 30 03 JMP ($0330)     do LOAD vector, usually points to $F4A5
