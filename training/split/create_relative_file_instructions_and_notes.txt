# ********* - Section 7.4: Step-by-step notes describing the relative file creation program: which lines in the sample program perform file creation, how POSITION CHR$ values set pointer positions (CHR$(1) and CHR$(25)), and that POSITION does not itself read or write data but sets file pointer for subsequent PRINT#/INPUT# operations.

7.4 CREATE A RELATIVE FILE

The program below, creates a relative file with 2 fields.  The first
field starts in position 1 of the record and the second field starts
in position 25.

LINE 8: Create the file.  Make room for records of 50 characters with
the CHR$(50). Use the Z$ as a file, input variable in LINE 6, you can
then press the f1 function key to create a file.

LINE 30: Point to the first character position of a file.  P tells the
disk drive to point to the position in the record that corresponds to
the optional, CHR$(1).

NOTE: If the CHR$ is not specified, character position defaults to 1.

LINE 65: Point to the twenty-fifth character position of a file.  P
tells the disk drive to point to the position in the record that
corresponds to the CHR$(25).

NOTE: The POSITION command does NOT write anything to, or read
anything from the file.  It just points to the position specified in
the record.
