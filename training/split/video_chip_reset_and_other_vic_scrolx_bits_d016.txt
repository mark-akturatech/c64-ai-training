# ********* - Horizontal Fine Scrolling and Control Register ($D016) bits: Bits0-2 fine horizontal scroll (0-7), Bit3 38/40 column selection, Bit4 multicolor enable, Bit5 VIC-II reset (video off when set to 1), Bits6-7 unused; default value and coarse scroll interaction; sample BASIC to illustrate smooth horizontal scroll and need for raster interrupts for partial-screen scrolling.

registers (53267-8, $D013-4).

Bit 2 enables the sprite-foreground collision interrupt.  This
interrupt can occur if one of the srpte character's dots is touching
one of the dots from the foreground display of either text character
or bitmap graphics.

Bit 3 enables the sprite-sprite collision interrupt, which can occur
if one of the sprite character's dots is touching one of the dots of
another sprite character.

These two interrupts are useful for games, where such collisions often
require that some action be taken immediately.  Once the interrupt
signals that a collision has occurred, the interrupt routine can check
the Sprite- Foreground Collision Register at 53279 ($D01F), or the
Sprite-Sprite Collision Register at 53278 ($D01E), to see which sprite
or sprites are involved in the collision.  See the entry for those
locations for more details on collisions.

Sprite to Foreground Display Priority Register

Bit 0:  Select display priority of Sprite 0 to foreground (0=sprite
        appears in front of foreground)
Bit 1:  Select display priority of Sprite 1 to foreground (0=sprite
        appears in front of foreground)
Bit 2:  Select display priority of Sprite 2 to foreground (0=sprite
        appears in front of foreground)
Bit 3:  Select display priority of Sprite 3 to foreground (0=sprite
        appears in front of foreground)
Bit 4:  Select display priority of Sprite 4 to foreground (0=sprite
        appears in front of foreground)
Bit 5:  Select display priority of Sprite 5 to foreground (0=sprite
        appears in front of foreground)
Bit 6:  Select display priority of Sprite 6 to foreground (0=sprite
        appears in front of foreground)
Bit 7:  Select display priority of Sprite 7 to foreground (0=sprite
        appears in front of foreground)

If a sprite is positioned to appear at a spot on the screen that is
already occupied by text or bitmap graphics, a conflict arises.  The
contents of this register determines which one will be displayed in
such a situation.  If the bit that corresponds to a particular sprite
is set to 0, the sprite will be displayed in front of the foreground
graphics data.  If that bit is set to 1, the foreground data will be
displayed in front of the sprite.  The default value that this
register is set to at power-on is 0, so all sprites start out with
priority over foreground graphics.

Note that for the purpose of priority, the 01 bit-pair of multicolor
graphics modes is considered to display a background color, and
therefore will be shown behind sprite graphics even if the foreground
graphics data takes priority.  Also, between the sprites themselves
there is a fixed priority.  Each sprite has priority over all
higher-number sprites, so that Sprite 0 is displayed in front of all
the others.

The use of priority can aid in creating three-dimensional effects, by
allowing some objects on the screen to pass in front of or behind
other objects.

Sprite Multicolor Registers

Bit 0:  Select multicolor mode for Sprite 0 (1=multicolor, 0=hi-res)
Bit 1:  Select multicolor mode for Sprite 1 (1=multicolor, 0=hi-res)
Bit 2:  Select multicolor mode for Sprite 2 (1=multicolor, 0=hi-res)
Bit 3:  Select multicolor mode for Sprite 3 (1=multicolor, 0=hi-res)
Bit 4:  Select multicolor mode for Sprite 4 (1=multicolor, 0=hi-res)
Bit 5:  Select multicolor mode for Sprite 5 (1=multicolor, 0=hi-res)
Bit 6:  Select multicolor mode for Sprite 6 (1=multicolor, 0=hi-res)
Bit 7:  Select multicolor mode for Sprite 7 (1=multicolor, 0=hi-res)

Sprite multicolor mode is very similar to text and bitmap multicolor
modes (see Bit 4 of 53270, $D016).  Normally, the color of each dot of
the sprite is controlled by a single bit of sprite shape data.  When
thi mode is enabled for a sprite, by setting the corresponding bit of
this register to 1, the bits of sprite shape data are grouped together
in pairs, with each pair of bits controlling a double-wide dot of the
sprite display.  By sacrificing some of the horizontal resolution (the
sprite, although the same size, is now only 12 dots wide), you gain
the use of two additional colors.  The four possible combinations of
these bit-pairs display dot colors from the following sources:

00 Background Color Register 0 (transparent)
01 Sprite Multicolor Register 0 (53285, $D025)
10 Sprite Color Registers (53287-94, $D027-E)
11 Sprite Multicolor Register 1 (53286, $D026)

Like multicolor text characters, multicolor sprites all share two
color registers.  While each sprite can display three foreground
colors, only one of these colors in unique to that sprite.  The number
of unique colors may be increated by combining more than one sprite
into a single character.

Sprite Horizontal Expansion Register

Bit 0:  Expand Sprite 0 horizontally (1=double-width sprite, 0=normal
        width)
