# 6502 ADDRESSING MODES - Implicit addressing: instruction requires no operand because the target is implied by the opcode. Examples: CLC clears the carry flag; TAX transfers accumulator to X. Saves memory by storing only the opcode.

Implicit

Some instructions don’t require an operand, as the location of the data to be manipulated is implied by the instruction itself.  This means that the assembler can save memory by just storing the instruction code in memory.

CLC		Clear the carry bit in the flags register.
TAX		Transfer the contents of the accumulator to index register X.
