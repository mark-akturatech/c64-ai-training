# A 256 Byte Autostart Fast Loader for the Commodore 64 - 1541 sector format notes: the filesystem stores track/sector of the next block in the first two bytes, leaving 254 bytes of usable payload in a 256-byte sector. This also conceals the drive code in the 'unused' area of the sector.


Sector Format:
The 1541 filesystem stores link information in the first two bytes
(track/sector of next block). This reduces usable space to 254 bytes,
but also conveniently hides the drive code as "unused" space.
