# byRiclianll - Explains the primary interest in the first 16 bytes of a side sector: bytes 0-1 = next side-sector (here track $0C sector $13), byte 2 = side sector number (0), byte 3 = record size ($96 = 150). Bytes 5-15 contain track/sector locations of up to six possible side sectors (table provided).


.  00:  OC  13  OO  96  11  OD  OC  13 
.    OS:    06   10   13  OF  OO  OO  OO  OO 


Bytes  0  and  1  show  us  that  the  next  side  sector  resides  at  track  12  ($0C),  sector  19  ($13). 
Byte  2  informs  us  that  this  is  side  sector  0.  A  maximum  of  6  side  sectors  are  used  by 
any  one  relative  file.  This  is  determined  solely  by  the  physical  storage  capacity  of  the 
diskette  (664  blocks  free  after  formatting  divided  by  120  track  and  sector  pointers  in 
a  side  sector  equals  5.53  side  sectors).  Side  sectors  are  numbered  from  0  to  5.  Byte  3 
shows  us  the  record  size  again  (150  bytes).  Bytes  5-15  are  the  track  and  sector  locations 
of  the  six  possible  side  sectors.  They  can  be  tabled  as  follows: 


BYTE             SIDE  SECTOR  TRACK  -  SECTOR 

4-5  0  17  ($11)  -  13  ($0D) 

6-7  1  12  ($0C)  -  19  ($13) 

8-  9  2  6  ($06)  -  16  ($10) 

10-11  3  19  ($13)  -  15  ($0F) 

12-13  4  0($00)-  0($00) 

14-15  5  0($00)-  0($00)
