# ********* - Mirrored VIC-II register images in $D040-$D3FF due to limited decoding (every 64 bytes mirrors), then SID register block introduction ($D400-$D41C): 6581 SID provides three voices, each with frequency, pulse width, envelope (ADSR), waveform control, oscillator sync/ring mod, and programmable filters (low/high/band-pass).

interrupt used for keyboard scanning, or the more complexly timed
interrupts that drive the tape read and write routines).  As you will
see below, the CIA chip has a host of other features to aid in
Input/Output functions.

Location Range: 56320-56321 ($DC00-$DC01)
CIA #1 Data Ports A and B

These registers are where the actual communication with outside
devices takes place.  Bits of data written to these registers can be
sent to external devices, while bits of data that those devices send
can be read here.

The keyboard is so necessary to the computer's operation that you may
have a hard time thinking of it as a peripheral device.  Nonetheless,
it cannot be directly read by the 6510 microprocessor.  Instead, the
keys are connected in a matrix of eight rows by eight columns to CIA
#1 Ports A and B.  The layout of this matrix is shown below.

As you can see, there are two keys which do not appear in the matrix.
The SHIFT LOCK key is not read as a separate key, but rather is a
mechanical device which holds the left SHIFT key switch in a closed
position.  The RESTORE key is not read like the other keys either.  It
is directly connected to the NMI interrupt line of the 6510
microprocessor, and causes an NMI interrupt to occur whenever it is
pressed (not just when it is pressed with the STOP key).

In order to read the individual keys in the matrix, you must first set
Port A for all outputs (255, $FF), and Port B for all inputs (0),
using the Data Direction Registers.  Note that this is the default
condition.  Next, you must write a 0 in the bit of Data Port A that
corresponds to the column that you wish to read, and a 1 to the bits
that correspond to columns you wish to ignore.  You will then be able
to read Data Port B to see which keys in that column are being pushed.

A 0 in any bit position signifies that the key in the corresponding
row of the selected column is being pressed, while a 1 indicates that
the key is not being pressed.  A value of 255 ($FF) means that no keys
in that column are being pressed.

Fortunately for us all, an interrupt routine causes the keyboard to be
read, and the results are made available to the Operating System
automatically every 1/60 second.  And even when the normal interrupt
routine cannot be used, you can use the Kernal SCNKEY routine at 65439
($FF9F) to read the keyboard.

These same data ports are also used to read the joystick controllers.
Although common sense might lead you to believe that you could read
the joystick that is plugged into the port marked Controller Port 1
from Data Port A, and the second joystick from Data Port B, there is
nothing common about the Commodore 64.  Controller Port 1 is read from
Data Port B, and Controller Port 2 is read from CIA #1 Data Port A.

Joysticks consist of five switches, one each for up, down, right, and
left directions, and another for the fire button.  The switches are
read like the key switches--if the switch is pressed, the
corresponding bit will read 0, and if it is not pressed, the bit will
be set to 1.  From BASIC, you can PEEK the ports and use the AND and
NOT operators to mask the unused bits and inverse the logic for easier
comprehension.  For example, to read the joystick in Controller Port
1, you could use the statement:

S1=NOT PEEK(56321)AND15

The meaning of the possible numbers returned are:

 0 = none pressed
 1 = up
 2 = down
 4 = left
 5 = up left
 6 = down left
 8 = right
 9 = up right
10 = down right

The same technique can be used for joystick 2, by substituting 56320
as the number to PEEK.  By the way, the 3 and 7 aren't listed because
they represent impossible combinations like up-down.
