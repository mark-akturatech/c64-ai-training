# byRiclianll - Specifies how DOS computes checksums: the header block checksum is the EOR of sector number, track number, ID LO, and ID HI. The data block checksum is the EOR of all 256 data bytes in the sector (typically a forward track/sector pointer plus 254 data bytes). Notes that bytes are EORed before GCR conversion.


A  header  block  checksum  is  the  EOR  of:  the  sector  number,  the  track  number,  the  ID 
LO,  and  the  ID  HI.  (These  four  bytes  serve  to  differentiate  sectors  from  one  another 
on  a  diskette.)  A  data  block  checksum  is  the  EOR  of  all  256  8-bit  data  bytes  in  a  sector. 
Recall  that  a  data  block  normally  consists  of  a  forward  track  and  sector  pointer  plus 
254  data  bytes.  Please  note  that  bytes  are  EORed  by  the  DOS  prior  to  their  GCR 
conversion.
