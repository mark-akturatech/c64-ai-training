# COMMODORE 64 - Indirect indexed addressing (also called (zp),Y): uses a zero-page pointer whose low and high bytes (in consecutive zero-page locations) form the base address; the Y register is then added to that address. Example: if $02 contains low byte $45 and $03 contains high byte $1E, LDA ($02),Y with Y=$00 accesses $1E45. Includes short code example showing how to set up the pointer and use LDA ($02),Y.

  INDIRECT INDEXED

    This only allows usage of the Y register as the index. The actual ad-
  dress can only be in zero page, and the mode of instruction is called
  indirect because the zero page address specified in the instruction con-
  tains the low byte of the actual address, and the next byte to it
  contains the high order byte.

  EXAMPLE:

    Let us suppose that location $02 contains $45, and location $03 con-
  tains $1E. If the instruction to load the accumulator in the indirect
  indexed mode is executed and the specified zero page address is $02, then
  the actual address will be:

    Low order = contents of $02
    High order = contents of $03
    Y register = $00

  Thus the actual address = $1E45 + Y = $1E45.
    The title of this mode does in fact imply an indirect principle,
  although this may be difficult to grasp at first sight. Let's look at it
  another way:
    "I am going to deliver this letter to the post office at address $02,
  MEMORY ST., and the address on the letter is $05 houses past $1600,
  MEMORY street." This is equivalent to the code:

    LDA #$00      - load low order actual base address
    STA $02       - set the low byte of the indirect address
    LDA #$16      - load high order indirect address
    STA $03       - set the high byte of the indirect address
    LDY #$05      - set the indirect index (Y)
    LDA ($02),Y   - load indirectly indexed by Y
