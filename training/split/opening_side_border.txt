# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Opening the side border: requires a stable raster and per-line timing; analogous to top/bottom border method but uses $D016 manipulations per raster line. Hint: use DEC $D016 then INC $D016 for timing; test with $D021 to find correct timing next to right border.

Opening the Side Border
If you've got a stable raster, you can open the side border in exactly the same way as you open the top and bottom borders, but instead of $d011, you use $d016, and instead of once every frame, you have to do it on every raster line, where you want the border to be opened. This isn't the first effect you should try to code, but if you've got a stable raster, give it a try.

A hint: use DEC $d016 and then INC $d016. To see that you're in the right place (just by the right border), use $d021 instead of $d016 when timing it.
