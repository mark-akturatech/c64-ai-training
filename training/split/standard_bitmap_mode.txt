# The MOS 6567/6569 video controller (VIC-II) and its application in the Commodore 64 - ECM=0, BMM=1, MCM=0 standard bitmap mode. VIC reads 320x200 bitmap; video matrix supplies color info per 8x8 block. Addressing: c-access uses VM bits + VC (1000 matrix addresses), c-data: color nybbles for '1' and '0' pixels; g-access addresses include CB13 with VC9..VC0 and RC2..RC0 (maps into bitmap). g-data: 8 pixels (1bpp) where '0' uses c-data bits 0-3 and '1' uses c-data bits 4-7.

3.7.3.3. Standard bitmap mode (ECM/BMM/MCM=0/1/0)
-------------------------------------------------

In this mode (as in all bitmap modes), the VIC reads the graphics data from
a 320�200 bitmap in which every bit corresponds to one pixel on the screen.
The data from the video matrix is used for color information. As the video
matrix is still only a 40�25 matrix, you can only specify the colors for
blocks of 8�8 pixels individually (sort of a YC 8:1 format). As the
designers of the VIC wanted to realize the bitmap mode with as little
additional circuitry as possible (the VIC-I didn't have a bitmap mode), the
arrangement of the bitmap in memory is somewhat weird: In contrast to
modern video chips that read the bitmap in a linear fashion from memory,
the VIC forms an 8�8 pixel block on the screen from 8 successive bytes of
the bitmap. The video matrix and the bitmap can be moved in memory with the
bits VM10-VM13 and CB13 of register $d018.

In standard bitmap mode, every bit in the bitmap directly corresponds to
one pixel on the screen. Foreground and background color can be arbitrarily
set for every 8�8 block.
