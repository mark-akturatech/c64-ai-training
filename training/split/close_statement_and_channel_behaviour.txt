# byRiclianll - CLOSE statement usage: SYNTAX: CLOSE file#. EXAMPLE: CLOSE 15. Notes that loading/running/editing closes communication channels automatically; the command channel is closed properly but data channels are aborted (not closed) which can leave files not properly closed on the drive. Recommends habitually closing files when finished.

4.  CLOSE  the  command  channel  when  you  are  done. 

After  you  have  finished  using  the  command  channel,  it  should  be  closed.  Recall  that 
the  open  command  has  three  parameters:  the  logical  file  number,  the  device  number, 
and  the  channel  number.  The  close  command  has  only  one,  the  logical  file  number.  It 
looks  like  this: 

SYNTAX:      CLOSE  file* 
EXAMPLE:    CLOSE  15 

where 

file#  =  the  logical  file  number  you  used  when  you  opened  the  command  channel 

NOTE:  Loading,  running,  or  editing  a  program  closes  down  all  communication  channels 
automatically.  The  command  channel  is  closed  properly  in  each  instance.  However,  data 
channels  are  aborted  rather  than  closed.  When  a  data  channel  is  aborted,  the  file  is  NOT 
CLOSED  properly  on  the  disk  drive.  You  do  not  have  to  close  the  command  channel 
after  the  issuance  of  every  command.  If  you  forget  to  close  it,  the  worst  that  can  hap- 
pen is  a  ?FILE  OPEN  ERROR  when  you  attempt  to  open  it  again.  However,  you  should 
get  into  the  habit  of  always  closing  a  file  when  you  are  finished  using  it.  You  won't  get 
into  trouble  leaving  the  command  channel  open,  but  you  may  lose  an  important  data 
file  if  you  leave  a  data  communication  channel  open.
