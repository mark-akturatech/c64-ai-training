# Analyzing C64 tape loaders - Details how the Cauldron non-IRQ turbo loader autostarts by modifying the IMAIN vector at $0302-$0303 to point to the turbo loader code ($02AE). Explains that parts of the turbo loader are included in the CBM header and data blocks, and that the CBM loader can be used to overwrite vectors (e.g. $0326/$0327) so the kernel executes the turbo loader after a standard LOAD.




==== Non-IRQ Loader ====

Here we'll see how this Turbo Loader performs the operations we discussed before. Please consult the documentation about this loader (CHR Loader T1) coming with Stewart Wilson't Final TAP.
Get a Tap version of "Cauldron" if you want to extract yourself the listings I report here.

CHR Loader T1-T3 routines are partly stored in the CBM file Header. CBM file Data (loaded at $02A7-0303) stores other routines and is used to cause the autostart of this loader.
The autostart feature is performed by using the IMAIN Vector at $0302-0303. By default, this vector points to the address of the main BASIC program loop at $A483. This is the routine that is operating when you are in the direct mode (READY.). It executes statements, or stores them as program lines.
Cauldron Loader sets the IMAIN Vector to point to $02AE, therefore, when CBM LOAD ends, control is given to the Turbo Loader.
