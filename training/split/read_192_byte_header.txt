# A Minimal C64 Datasette Program Loader - Code to read the 192-byte header: set ptr (two bytes) to the buffer address (LDX/LDY then STX/STY to ptr/ptr+1), call get_countdown to synchronize, set A to 192 and call get_block to read the header into memory.

Read the 192-byte header:

    ldx #<buffer
    ldy #>buffer
    stx ptr
    sty ptr + 1
    jsr get_countdown
    lda #192
    jsr get_block

- "get_countdown" which expands on synchronizes to the file start before reading the header
