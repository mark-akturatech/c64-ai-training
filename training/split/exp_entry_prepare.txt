# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Initial entry sequence to perform EXP(): sets pointers to the 1/LOG(2) constant, performs a convert-AY (FAC1*(AY)), applies rounding based on FAC1 rounding byte, optionally calls round FAC1, then jumps to the EXP kernel continuation in the KERNAL at $E000.


                                *** perform EXP()
.,BFED A9 BF    LDA #$BF        set 1.443 pointer low byte
.,BFEF A0 BF    LDY #$BF        set 1.443 pointer high byte
.,BFF1 20 28 BA JSR $BA28       do convert AY, FCA1*(AY)
.,BFF4 A5 70    LDA $70         get FAC1 rounding byte
.,BFF6 69 50    ADC #$50        +$50/$100
.,BFF8 90 03    BCC $BFFD       skip rounding if no carry
.,BFFA 20 23 BC JSR $BC23       round FAC1 (no check)
.,BFFD 4C 00 E0 JMP $E000       continue EXP()
