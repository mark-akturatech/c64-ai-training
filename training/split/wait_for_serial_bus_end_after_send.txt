# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Sequence to wait for end-of-transaction on the serial bus after sending: disable interrupts, force serial data low, set ATN high, set clock high, poll serial data status until clock low/high transitions complete, then re-enable interrupts and return.

                                *** wait for the serial bus end after send
