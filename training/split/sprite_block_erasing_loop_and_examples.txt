# COMMODORE 64 - Shows a sample loop to erase blocks inside a sprite: LINE 90 example '90 FOR A=836 TO 891 STEP 3:POKE A,0:NEXT A'. Explains grouping: pixels are in 8-pixel blocks and this loop erases the 5th group (block 836) and every third block up to 890. Suggests experimenting by POKEing any addresses from 832 to 894 with 255 (solid) or 0 (blank) to change sprite shape.


    The following line, which you can add to your program. erases the
  blocks in the MIDDLE of the sprite you created:

    90 FOR A=836 TO 891 STEP 3:POKE A,O:NEXT A

    Remember, the pixels that make up the sprite are grouped in blocks of
  eight. This line erases the 5th group of eight pixels (block 836) and
  every third block up to block 890. Try POKEing any of the other numbers
  from 832 to 894 with either a 255 to make them solid or 0 to make them
  blank.
