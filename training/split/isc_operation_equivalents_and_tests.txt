# NMOS 6510 - Operation and behaviour summary for ISC/ISB/INS: increments memory by one then performs SBC (subtract with borrow) using that memory. Notes that the carry (C) affects the SBC and SBC sets N/V/Z/C as expected. Mentions that ISC inherits SBC's decimal-mode dependency and points to the decimal-mode notes. Provides a short example (ISC $FF) and lists equivalent instruction sequence (INC $FF; SBC $FF) and test files (Lorenz/*.prg, 64doc/dincsbc.prg).

Operation: Increase memory by one, then subtract memory from accumulator (with borrow).
•

C is affecting the SBC, and SBC sets N / V / Z / C as expected

This instruction inherits the decimal flag dependency from SBC. For the behaviour in decimal mode
see Unintended decimal mode: ISC (ISB, INS).
Example:
ISC $FF

;E7 FF

Equivalent Instructions:
INC $FF
SBC $FF
Test code: Lorenz-2.15/insa.prg, Lorenz-2.15/insax.prg,
Lorenz-2.15/insay.prg, Lorenz-2.15/insix.prg,
Lorenz-2.15/insiy.prg, Lorenz-2.15/insz.prg,
