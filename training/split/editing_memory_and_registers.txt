# MACHINE - Explains changing memory contents (screen editing): position the cursor over displayed hex byte, type new value, press RETURN to write it to memory; warns to press RETURN before moving to next line. Also covers changing registers via .R display and typing new values (cautioning not to change SR and SP unless you know the consequences).


Changing Memory Contents
------------------------

Once we have displayed the contents of part of memory, we can change that
part of memory easily.  All we need to do is to move the cursor until it is
positioned over the memory contents in question, type over the value
displayed, and then press RETURN.

This is quite similar to the way BASIC programs may be changed; you may type
over on the screen, and when you press RETURN, the new line replaces the old.
The general technique is called screen editing.

If you have displayed the contents of memory, as in the example above, you
might like to change a number of locations to zero.  Don't forget to strike
RETURN so that the change on the screen will take effect in memory.  Give
another .M memory display command to confirm that memory has indeed been
changed.


Changing Registers
------------------

We may also change the contents of registers by typing over and pressing
RETURN.  You may take a register display with command .R, and then change the
contents of PC, AC, XR, and YR.  Leave the contents of SR and SP unchanged--
tricky things could happen unexpectedly if you experiment with these two.
