# SID 6581/8580 Sound Interface Device - Programming Guide - List of SID quirks: ADSR bug (delayed retrigger), noise LFSR lockup and recovery (write TEST then waveform), write-only register readback returns bus value, 6581 filter distortion and DC offset, combined waveform differences between 6581/8580, TEST bit behavior (oscillator reset/hold), and volume-register click exploited for digi playback on 6581.

15. KNOWN QUIRKS AND BUGS
================================================================================

1. ADSR BUG: See section 4.2. The internal rate counter can cause a delay
   when retriggering a note. Music players use "hard restart" techniques
   to mitigate this.

2. NOISE LFSR LOCKUP: Selecting noise simultaneously with another waveform
   (or switching from a combined waveform to noise) can freeze the noise
   shift register, producing silence. Fix: write $08 (test bit) to the
   control register, then write the desired waveform.

3. WRITE-ONLY REGISTERS: Reading from write-only registers ($D400-$D418)
   returns the last value written to ANY SID register (bus value), not the
   register's actual contents. This is a common source of bugs.

4. FILTER DISTORTION (6581): The 6581's filter has significant non-linearities
   and can clip/distort at high resonance or when multiple voices are routed
   through it at high volume. This is part of its characteristic sound.

5. DC OFFSET (6581): The 6581 has a noticeable DC offset on its audio output
   that varies with waveform selection and filter settings. This contributes
   to the "click" when changing volume (used for digi playback).

6. COMBINED WAVEFORM DIFFERENCES: The 6581 and 8580 produce different results
   for combined waveforms due to die-level differences. Code relying on
   specific combined waveform behavior may sound different on different chips.

7. TEST BIT: Setting the TEST bit (bit 3 of control register) resets and
   holds the oscillator accumulator at zero. When TEST is cleared, the
   oscillator resumes from zero, which can be used for phase-accurate
   oscillator reset.

8. VOLUME REGISTER CLICK (6581): Any write to $D418 produces an audible
   click proportional to the volume change. Even writing the same value
   produces a tiny click. This is exploited for sample playback but can
   cause unwanted noise in normal music.
