# MACHINE - Control of /IRQA specifics: CRA bit 7 is set by an active CA1 transition, and interrupting from this flag is disabled by CRA bit 0 being 0. CRA bit 6 is set by CA2 active transition and controlled by CRA bit 3. Both bits 6 and 7 are reset by a 'Read Peripheral Output Register A' operation (reading Port A).

Control of /IRQA
----------------

Control Register A bit 7 is always set by an active transition of the CA1
interrupt input signal.  Interrupting from this flag can be disabled by
setting bit 0 in the Control Register A (CRA) to a logic 0.  Likewise,
Control Register A bit 6 can be set by an active transition of the CA2
interrupt input signal.  Interrupting from this flag can be disabled by
setting bit 3 in the Control Register to a logic 0.

Both bit 6 and bit 7 in CRA are reset by a "Read Peripheral Output Register
A" operation.  This is defined as an operation in which the processor reads
the Peripheral A I/O port.
