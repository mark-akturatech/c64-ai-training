# Kick Assembler - Explains .assert for testing expressions: .assert "2+5*10/2", 2+5*10/2, 27. Shows how results and expected values are printed and mismatches flagged as errors. Supports numerical and compound types (e.g., vectors).

visible from the java classpath. If you are using eclipse to run your Kick Assembler, like in the example project,
you don’t have to worry about this. If you are using the command line you will have to set either the classpath
environment variable or use the classpath option of the java command.
Secondly you should tell Kick Assembler about your plugin. There are two ways to do this. If your plugin is
only used in one of your projects, you should use the .plugin directive. Eg:
.plugin "test.plugins.macros.MyMacro"

If the plugin should be available every time you use Kick Assembler, you place the class name in a line in the
file ‘KickAss.plugin’ which should be placed in the same locations as the KickAss.jar. Using // in the start of the
line makes it a comment. Example of a KickAss.plugin file:
// My macro plugins
test.plugins.macros.MyMacro1
test.plugins.macros.MyMacro2
