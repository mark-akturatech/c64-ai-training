# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - Small helper that stores $C2 into $AD and $C1 into $AC then returns (LDA $C2 / STA $AD / LDA $C1 / STA $AC / RTS). Used to transfer current pointer bytes into temporary AD/AC storage.


.,FB8E A5 C2    LDA $C2
.,FB90 85 AD    STA $AD
.,FB92 A5 C1    LDA $C1
.,FB94 85 AC    STA $AC
.,FB96 60       RTS
