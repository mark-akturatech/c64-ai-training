# Contents - Bitmapped graphics overview: 320x200 display, 64,000 pixels, requiring 8000 bytes (1 bit per pixel). Two bitmapped modes: standard bitmap (320x200, two colors per 8x8 block) and multicolor bitmap (160x200, four colors per 8x8).

BIT MAPPING 

Even though the various text modes available 
to you in the Commodore 64 provide many different 
options for displaying graphics, they still restrict you 
to using predefined shapes. For the majority of 
video game applications, you will be unable to use 
a text mode. The Commodore 64 has a high resolu- 
tion bit mapped graphics mode that allows you to 
control each pixel on the screen individually. The 
display has a resolution of 320 pixels horizontally 
by 200 pixels vertically. This gives a total of 64000 



pixels that can be controlled on the screen. Since 
each pixel is represented by a bit in graphics 
memory, 8000 bytes of graphics memory are re- 
quired to represent the display. 

There are two different types of bit mapped 
modes available on the Commodore 64. They are: 

• Standard bitmapped mode: 32011 by 20OV, two 
colors per 8 by 8 group of pixels. 

• Multicolor bitmapped mode: 160H by 20OV, four 
colors per 8 by 8 group of pixels.
