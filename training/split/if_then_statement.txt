# COMMODORE 64 - IF <expression> THEN <line number> | IF <expression> GOTO <line number> | IF <expression> THEN <statements>: conditional evaluation semantics—WHEN false, part after THEN ignored; WHEN true either branches to line or executes statements. Examples: IF used for validation and conditional inline statements; THEN GOTO shorthand explanation; example demonstrating multiple statements after THEN separated by colons.

  IF...THEN...

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: IF <expression> THEN <line number>
	  IF <expression> GOTO <line number>
	  IF <expression> THEN <statements>

    Action: This is the statement that gives BASIC most of its "intelli-
  gence," the ability to evaluate conditions and take different actions de-
  pending on the outcome.

    The word IF is followed by an expression, which can include variables,
  strings, numbers, comparisons, and logical operators. The word THEN
  appears on the same line and is followed by either a line number or one
  or more BASIC statements. When the expression is false, everything after
  the word THEN on that line is ignored, and execution continues with the
  next line number in the program. A true result makes the program either
  branch to the line number after the word THEN or execute whatever other
  BASIC statements are found on that line.


  EXAMPLE of IF...GOTO...Statement:

    100 INPUT "TYPE A NUMBER"; N
    110 IF N <= 0 GOTO 200
    120 PRINT "SQUARE ROOT=" SQR(N)
    130 GOTO 100
    200 PRINT "NUMBER MUST BE >0"
    210 GOTO 100

    This program prints out the square root of any positive number. The IF
  statement here is used to validate the result of the INPUT. When the
  result of N <= 0 is true, the program skips to line 200, and when the
  result is false the next line to be executed is 120. Note that THEN GOTO
  is not needed with IF...THEN, as in line 110 where GOTO 200 actually
  means THEN GOTO 200.


  EXAMPLE OF IF...THEN...Statement:

    100 FOR L = 1 TO 100
    110 IF RND(1) < .5 THEN X=X+1: GOTO 130
    120 Y=Y+1
    130 NEXT L
    140 PRINT "HEADS=" X
    150 PRINT "TAILS= " Y

  The IF in line 110 tests a random number to see if it is less than .5.
  When the result is true, the whole series of statements following the
  word THEN are executed: first X is incremented by 1, then the program
  skips to line 130. When the result is false, the program drops to the
  next statement, line 120.
