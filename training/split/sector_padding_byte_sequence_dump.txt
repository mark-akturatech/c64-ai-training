# byRiclianll - The concrete byte-by-byte padding pattern shown as a linear dump of marker values. Each line is a single marker (00 for null padding, OO for non-null marker) representing the actual padding bytes across the sectors referenced by the header labels. This is the detailed data example used to show exactly where non-null markers (OO) and nulls (00) appear across the sectors.
