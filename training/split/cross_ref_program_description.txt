# MACHINE - CROSS REF and CROSS REF 64: program that prepares a cross-reference listing for BASIC programs on disk, cross-referencing line numbers and variables. Implements character classification via a 256-element table and a state-transition table. The BASIC program has a second SYS that prints line numbers and uses an efficient binary-to-decimal conversion using decimal mode.



  CROSS REF        - for PET/CBM
  CROSS REF 64     - for Commodore 64

This program prepares a cross-reference listing for any selected BASIC
program on disk.  It cross-references both line numbers and variables.  It's
a good way to document a BASIC program.

The program uses two table lookup techniques that may be confusing to the
beginning machine language program reader.  First, it classifies all
characters received from BASIC in terms of "type"; this is done with a table
of 256 elements, one for each possible character.  Second, it used a "state
transition table" to record the nature of the job in progress; for example,
after meeting a GOSUB "token," it will expect to receive a line number.

                                                                        :312:

The second SYS in the BASIC program is used to print the line numbers of the
cross-reference.  It employs an efficient binary-to-decimal conversion
technique, which uses decimal mode.
