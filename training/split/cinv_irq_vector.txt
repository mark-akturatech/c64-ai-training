# - C64 RAM Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $0314-$0315 CINV: vector to the IRQ interrupt routine (normally at $EA31 / 59953). Explains that CIA #1 Timer B causes IRQs every 1/60 second; changing the vector allows user ML routines to run periodically. Provides precautions: disable IRQs (SEI/CLI) before changing vector or use Kernal VECTOR routine; ROM pushes registers before jumping through vector (PHA, TXA, PHA, TYA, PHA) so user must restore stack correctly (PLA, TAY, PLA, TAX, PLA, RTI) or exit through normal IRQ; IRQ routine must determine source when multiple IRQ sources enabled; if replacing default IRQ, user should call old routine periodically to preserve keyboard scanning, clock, and STOP key handling.

$0314-$0315  CINV    Vector to IRQ Interrupt Routine
                     
                     This vector points to the address of the routine that is executed when
                     an IRQ interrupt occurs (normally 59953 ($EA31)).
                     
                     At power on, the CIA #1 Timer B is set to cause an IRQ interrupt to
                     occur every 1/60 second.  This vector is set to point to the routine
                     which updates the software clock and STOP key check, blinks the
                     cursor, maintains the tape interlock, and reads the keyboard.  By
                     changing this vector, the user can add or substitute a machine
                     language routine that will likewise execute every 1/60 second.  The
                     user who is writing IRQ interrupt routines should consider the
                     following:
                     
                     1.  It is possible for an IRQ interrupt to occur while you are
                     changing this vector, which would cause an error from which no
                     recovery could be made.  Therefore, you must disable all IRQ
                     interrupts before changing the contents of this location, and reenable
                     them afterwards, by using the 6510 SEI and CLI instructions, or by
                     using the Kernal VECTOR routine (64794, $FD1A) to set this vector.
                     
                     2.  There is some code in ROM that is executed before the interrupt
                     routine is directed through this vector.  This code checks whether the
                     source of the interrupt was an IRQ or BRK instruction.  If first
                     preserves the contents of all the registers by pushing them onto the
                     stack in the following sequence:  PHA, TXA, PHA, TYA, PHA.  It is up
                     to the user to restore the stack at the end of his routine, either by
                     exiting through the normal IRQ, or with the sequence:  PLA, TAY, PLA,
                     TAX, PLA, RTI.
                     
                     3.  There is only one IRQ vector, but there are many sources for IRQ
                     interrupts (two CIA chips, and several VIC chip IRQs).  If you plan to
                     enable IRQs from more than one source, the IRQ routine here must
                     determine the source, and continue the routine in the appropriate
                     place for an IRQ from that source.
                     
                     In the same vein, if you replace the normal IRQ routine with your own,
                     you should be aware that the keyboard's scanning and clock update will
                     not occur unless you call the old interrupt routine once every 1/60
                     second.  It is suggested that if you plan to use that routine, you
                     save the old vector address in some other location.  In that way, you
                     can JuMP to the keyboard interrupt routine through this alternate
                     vector, rather than assuming that the ROM address will never change
                     and that it is safe to jump into the ROM directly.
