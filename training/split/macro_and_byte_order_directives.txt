# Contents - Combined documentation of MAC/MND and byte-order/byte-splitting behavior as shown in the listings: the lines present the MAC and MND labels and indicate usages such as specifying low-order 8 bits and high-order 8 bits of a 16-bit value and that MAC starts a macro and MND ends a macro. Also notes that any of the listed directives may be preceded by a label.
