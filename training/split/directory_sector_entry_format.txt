# byRiclianll - Formal layout of any directory sector: byte 0 = track of next directory block, byte 1 = sector of next directory block, bytes 2-31 = File entry #1 (32 bytes), bytes 32-33 unused, bytes 34-63 = File entry #2, bytes 64-65 unused, bytes 66-95 = File entry #3, bytes 96-97 unused, bytes 98-127 = File entry #4, bytes 128-129 unused, bytes 130-159 = File entry #5, etc. Specifies the structure used to store multiple file entries per directory sector.

The  contents  of  any  directory  sector  can  be  tabled  as  follows: 


Byte  Contents  Purpose 


0  Track  of  the  next  directory  block 

1  Sector  of  the  next  directory  block 

2-31  File  entry  #1  in  the  directory  block 

32-33  0  Unused 

34-63  File  entry  #2  in  the  directory  block 

64-65  0  Unused 

66-95  File  entry  #3  in  the  directory  block 

96-97  0  Unused 

98-127  File  entry  #4  in  the  directory  block 

128-129  0  Unused 

130-159  File  entry  #5  in  the  directory  block
