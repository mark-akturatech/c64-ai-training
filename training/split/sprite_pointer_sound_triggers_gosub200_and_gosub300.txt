# COMMODORE 64 - Explains LINE 70 and LINE 75: conditional checks of the sprite pointer P (IF P=192 THEN GOSUB200 and IF P=193 THEN GOSUB300). Describes that when the pointer points at 192 it triggers the first sound-effect waveform subroutine (line 200), and when it points at 193 it triggers the second voice waveform subroutine (line 300).

  LINE 70:

    IFP=192THEN         If the sprite pointer is set to 192 (the first
    GOSUB200            sprite shape) the waveform control for the first
                        sound effect is set to 129 and 128 per line 200.
