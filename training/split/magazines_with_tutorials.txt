Magazines with Tutorials

C=Hacking. Great online magazine with articles about everything concerning CBM's 8 bit computers. In some of the early issues there are articles by Pasi ``Albert'' Ojala on demo effects. There's also a multipart Assembler tutorial in the first issues. Available from funet: ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/cbm/magazines/c=hacking/.

Discovery. I've only found three issues of this mag, but it has some nice demo-related articles, which you can learn a lot from. Like C=Hacking, the mag consists of ASCII text files that you can download off the Internet. Available from The Fridge: http://www.ffd2.com/fridge/discovery/.

Coders World. This is a disk mag, ie. a mag that you run on your C-64. Three issues were released, and they have a lot of simple code examples and explanations of how to make cool effects. This is a good resource for beginners. When you've learned a bit about the C-64, the info in this mag may seem a bit too basic. You can find the first two issues at eg. funet: ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/cbm/magazines/disk/c64/. The third one is a bit hard to find. You can get it from me if you can't find it on the net.
