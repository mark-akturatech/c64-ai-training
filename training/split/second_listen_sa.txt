# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - SECOND: SEND LISTEN SECONDARY ADDRESS. Entry: A contains the secondary address. Stores A into the serial buffer BSOUT ($95) and calls the handshake/send-byte routine at $ED36. This routine is the KERNAL SECOND ($FF93) vector implementation and drops through to CLEAR ATN afterwards.

                                The KERNAL routine SECOND ($ff93) is vectored here. On
                                entry, (A) holds the secondary address. This is placed in
                                the serial buffer and sent to the serial bus "under
                                attention". Finally the routine drops through to the next
                                routine to set ATN false.
