# byRiclianll - Explains the structure of the shown sequential data block: bytes 0/1 are the chain pointer to the next block (here linking to track 17 / $11, sector 14 / $0E); bytes 2–151 (150 bytes) are the first fixed-length record; unused bytes within a record are written as nulls by DOS. Explains that record content is program-dependent and that this example is a management record from a free-form database.

The  block  reveals  a  typical  sequential  file.  Bytes  0  and  1  are  the  chain.  The  first  data 
block  links  to  track  17  ($11),  sector  14  ($0E).  The  next  150  bytes  (2  -  151)  constitute 
our  first  record.  Note  that  the  unused  bytes  within  a  record  are  written  as  nulls  ($00) 
by  the  DOS  so  the  record  is  always  a  fixed  length.  The  content  of  individual  records 
will  vary  enormously.  This  is  program  dependent  so  the  data  block  in  question  contains 
whatever  data  was  specified  by  the  program  used.  This  particular  record  is  from  a  free 
form  data  base.  It  was  reserved  to  for  management  information  by  the  main  program 
and  contains  the  following  data:
