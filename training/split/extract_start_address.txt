# A Minimal C64 Datasette Program Loader - Extract start address from the header buffer: load buffer+1 (low) into X and buffer+2 (high) into Y, then store X/Y into ptr/ptr+1 to set the destination pointer for loading the program data.

Extract start address from header:

    ldx buffer + 1
    ldy buffer + 2
    stx ptr
    sty ptr + 1
