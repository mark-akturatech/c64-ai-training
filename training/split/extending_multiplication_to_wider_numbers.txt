# 6502 Multiplication and Division Algorithms - Source: llx.com - Notes that once the binary multiply algorithm is understood, routines for other operand widths are straightforward to write; advises readers to generalize the shown examples rather than bloating the document with many size variants.

At this point it seems to be common for people to ask for additional
routines to multiply even wider numbers.  Rather than bloat this article
with even more routines for numbers of various sizes, I encourage readers
to look back over the algorithm just described and the examples that
implement it - once these are understood, writing additional routines is
straightforward.
