# Contents - Color RAM location and format: Color RAM starts at $D800 and continues to $DBE7. Color RAM stores nibble (4-bit) values; when read you get a full byte but only the low 4 bits are valid — mask the upper 4 bits before use.

RAM. Color RAM starts at $D800 and continues 
to $DBE7. Unlike the normal RAM used in the 
Commodore 64, color RAM is made up of nibbles 
rather than bytes. When you read a value out of col- 
or ram, only the least significant four bits are valid. 
You will read an eight bit value, but the data in the 
upper four bits is not predictable. Quite often, you 
must mask the upper four bits before using data 
from the color RAM.
