# 6502 Instructions summary - Subroutine and interrupt instructions: JSR (Jump to subroutine) Absolute JSR $aaaa ($20, 3 bytes) ; RTS (Return from subroutine) opcode $60, 1 byte ; BRK (Force an interrupt) opcode $00, 1 byte, sets B and I flags ; RTI (Return from Interrupt) opcode $40, 1 byte, restores all flags ; NOP (No Operation) opcode $EA, 1 byte. Note: stack operations (PHA/PLA/PHP/PLP) are used with interrupts/subroutines.
