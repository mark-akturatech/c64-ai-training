# MACHINE - COPY-ALL and COPY-ALL.64: utilities for copying files between disk drives or to/from cassette. Combines machine language and BASIC: two SYS commands—one to get directory and one to perform copying. Uses a BASIC string as a transfer buffer; technique similar to STRING THING.

The program is written in machine language so that the BASIC ROM can be
flipped out, allowing for more memory space in which to copy programs.


  COPY-ALL         - for PET/CBM
  COPY-ALL.64      - for Commodore 64

A utility for copying files from one disk drive to another.  You will find
two SYS commands in the BASIC part of the program:  one to get the directory,
and the other to do the actual copying.

Information is copied from the selected file into a BASIC string that has
been set aside for the purpose.  A similar technique may be found in the
simpler STRING THING.
