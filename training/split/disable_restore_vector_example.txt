# Analyzing C64 tape loaders - Practical example showing how to modify the NMI vector in RAM to change RESTORE behavior. Example writes LDA #$C1 / STA $0318 to disable NMI/RESTORE actions and shows how to restore the original vector (LDA #$47 / STA $0318). Notes this affects all NMIs (e.g. RS-232 I/O).

LDA #$C1
STA $0318
</code>

will accomplish this. To set the vector back:

<code>
LDA #$47
STA $0318
</code>

Note that this will cut out all NMIs, including those required for RS-232 I/O.
