# COMMODORE 64 - Overview of the 6526 interval timers (Timer A and Timer B). Each timer has a 16-bit read-only Timer Counter and a 16-bit write-only Timer Latch: writes go to the latch, reads return the counter. Timers can be used independently or linked; used to generate delays, pulses, pulse trains, and waveforms. Timers can count internal clock pulses or external pulses via the CNT input, allowing frequency, pulse width and delay measurements. Each timer has an associated control register for configuration.


  Interval Timers (Timer A, Timer B)

    Each interval timer consists of a 16-bit read-only Timer Counter and a
  16-bit write-only Timer Latch. Data written to the timer are latched in
  the Timer Latch, while data read from the timer are the present contents
  of the Time Counter. The timers can be used independently or linked for
  extended operations. The various timer modes allow generation of long
  time delays, variable width pulses, pulse trains and variable frequency

  waveforms. Utilizing the CNT input, the timers can count external pulses
  or measure frequency, pulse width and delay times of external signals.
  Each timer has an associated control register, providing independent
  control of the following functions:
