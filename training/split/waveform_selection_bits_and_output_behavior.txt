# COMMODORE 64 - Waveform select bits (Bits 4-7) and final output notes: Bit 4 selects Triangle waveform (low harmonics, mellow), Bit 5 selects Sawtooth (rich harmonics, bright), Bit 6 selects Pulse (harmonic content adjustable by Pulse Width registers; sweeping pulse width creates phasing/motion), Bit 7 selects Noise (random signal changing at Oscillator 1 frequency; useful for unpitched sounds and effects). Concludes that one output waveform must be selected for audibility but de-selecting is unnecessary to silence — final output amplitude is controlled by the Envelope Generator.

    (Bit 4): When set to a one, the Triangle waveform output of Oscillator
  1 is selected. The Triangle waveform is low in harmonics and has a
  mellow, flute-like quality.
    (Bit 5): When set to a one, the Sawtooth waveform output of Oscillator
  1 is selected. The Sawtooth waveform is rich in even and odd harmonics
  and has a bright, brassy quality.
    (Bit 6): When set to a one, the Pulse waveform output of Oscillator 1
  is selected. The harmonic content of this waveform can be adjusted by the
  Pulse Width registers, producing tone qualities ranging from a bright,
  hollow square wave to a nasal, reedy pulse. Sweeping the pulse width in
  real-time produces a dynamic "phasing" effect which adds a sense of
  motion to the sound. Rapidly jumping between different pulse widths can
  produce interesting harmonic sequences.
    NOISE (Bit 7): When set to a one, the Noise output waveform of
  Oscillator 1 is selected. This output is a random signal which changes at
  the frequency of Oscillator 1. The sound quality can be varied from a low
  rumbling to hissing white noise via the Oscillator 1 Frequency registers.
  Noise is useful in creating explosions, gunshots, jet engines, wind, surf
  and other unpitched sounds, as well as snore drums and cymbals. Sweeping
  the oscillator frequency with Noise selected produces a dramatic rushing
  effect.
    One of the output waveforms must be selected for Oscillator 1 to be
  audible, however, it is NOT necessary to de-select waveforms to silence
  the output of Voice 1. The amplitude of Voice 1 at the final output is a
  function of the Envelope Generator only.
