# MACHINE - Introduces the idea of a 'wedge'—modifying BASIC's frequently-used zero-page subroutine used to get characters from BASIC text (CHRGET/CHRGOT). Gives typical locations: $0070-$0087 (most PET/CBM) and $0073-$008A (VIC-20, C64). Notes the routine is self-modifying and is used to fetch and classify characters (numeric, end-of-command, etc.).


Infiltrating BASIC:  The Wedge
------------------------------

In zero-page, there's a subroutine that the BASIC interpreter uses frequently
to obtain information from your BASIC program.  It's used to get a character
from your BASIC program, and to check it for type (numeric, end-of-command,
or other).

The routine is normally entered at either of two points:  CHRGET, to get the
next character from your BASIC program; and CHRGOT, to recheck the last
character.  The subroutine is located at $0070 to $0087 in most PET/CBM
computers, and at $0073 to $008A in VIC-20 or Commodore 64.  You may
disassemble it there if you wish.  The coding is described below.

                                                                        :123:

Since CHRGET is in different locations, depending on the machine, the
following code is shown with symbolic addresses.  That is, instead of showing
the hex address value, the address is given a name, or symbol.  Thus, CHRGOT
might represent address $0079, CHRGOT+1 would represent $007A, and so on.

  CHRGET INC CHRGOT+1
         BNE CHRGOT
