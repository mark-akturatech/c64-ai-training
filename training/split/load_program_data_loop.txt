# A Minimal C64 Datasette Program Loader - Main program load loop: call get_block with A=#0 to read until an end-of-data marker sets carry. After each block read, increment the high byte of ptr (ptr+1) to advance destination pointer; loop uses BCC to continue until high byte overflows, or get_block returns with carry to end.

Load the program data:

    m3: lda #0
        jsr get_block
        inc ptr + 1
        bcc m3

- "data_block_reading" which expands on get_block performs the actual byte writes
