# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - RDTIM: Read realtime jiffy clock (vectored at $ffde). Returns clock in (A/X/Y) formatted as high/mid/low bytes ($A0/$A1/$A2). Executes SEI to disable interrupts during read. Uses LDA/LDX/LDY to load values and returns.

                                *** RDTIM: GET TIME
                                The KERNAL routine RDTIM ($ffde) jumps to this routine.
                                The three byte jiffy clock is read into (A/X/Y) in the
                                format high/mid/low. The routine exits, setting the time
                                to its existing value in the next routine. The clock
                                resolution is 1/60 second. SEI is included since part of
                                the IRQ routine is to update the clock.
