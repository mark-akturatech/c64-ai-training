# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Start of character output to a channel: push the character to the stack, read the output device number ($9A) and compare with the screen device code. This entry covers the device-selection and dispatch start of the kernel CHROUT/OUTPUT routine (device routing), saving state in preparation for device-specific output.

                                *** output character to channel
.,F1CA 48       PHA             save the character to output
.,F1CB A5 9A    LDA $9A         get the output device number
.,F1CD C9 03    CMP #$03        compare the output device with the screen
.,F1CF D0 04    BNE $F1D5       if not the screen go ??
