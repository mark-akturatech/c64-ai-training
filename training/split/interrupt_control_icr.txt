# COMMODORE 64 - Interrupt Control Register (ICR): five interrupt sources (TIMER A underflow, TIMER B underflow, TOD ALARM, Serial Port full/empty, /FLAG); single-register mechanism with write-only MASK and read-only DATA; DATA bits set by any interrupt, IR (MSB) set when any enabled interrupt occurs and pulls /IRQ low; reading DATA clears the interrupt DATA register and releases /IRQ; details on mixing polled and masked interrupts and the need to preserve DATA if polled; MASK register semantics (bit 7 as SET/CLEAR control): when bit7=0, ones in written data clear corresponding mask bits; when bit7=1, ones set mask bits; an interrupt flag must have its mask bit set to assert IR and generate a CPU interrupt. Includes INT DATA (read) and INT MASK (write) register tables.

  Interrupt Control (ICR)

    There are five sources of interrupts on the 6526: underflow from TIMER
  A, underflow from TIMER B, TOD ALARM, Serial Port full/empty and /FLAG.
  A single register provides masking and interrupt information. The
  interrupt Control Register consists of a write-only MASK register and a
  read-only DATA register. Any interrupt will set the corresponding bit in
  the DATA register. Any interrupt which is enabled by the MASK register
  will set the IR bit (MSB) of the DATA register and bring the /IRQ pin
  low. In a multi-chip system, the IR bit can be polled to detect which
  chip has generated an interrupt request. The interrupt DATA register is
  cleared and the /IRQ line returns high following a read of the DATA
  register. Since each interrupt sets an interrupt bit regardless of the
  MASK, and each interrupt bit can be selectively masked to prevent the
  generation of a processor interrupt, it is possible to intermix polled
  interrupts with true interrupts. However, polling the IR bit will cause
  the DATA register to clear, therefore, it is up to the user to preserve
  the information contained in the DATA register if any polled interrupts
  were present.
    The MASK register provides convenient control of individual mask bits.
  When writing to the MASK register, if bit 7 (SET/CLEAR) of the data

                                                           APPENDIX M   433

  written is a ZERO, any mask bit written with a one will be cleared, while
  those mask bits written with a zero will be unaffected. If bit 7 of the
  data written is a ONE, any mask bit written with a one will be set, while
  those mask bits written with a zero will be unaffected. In order for an
  interrupt flag to set IR and generate an Interrupt Request, the corre-
  sponding MASK bit must be set.
