# C64 PRG Chapter 2 - Screen Editor Features

    There are some other characters that can be printed for special func-
  tions, although they are not easily available from the keyboard. In order
  to get these into quotes, you must leave empty spaces for them in the
  line, press <RETURN>, and go back to edit the line. Now you hold down
  the <CTRL> (ConTRoL) key and type <RVS ON> (ReVerSe-ON) to start typing
  reversed characters. Type the keys as shown below:


    Key Function                Key Entered         Appearance

    Shifted RETURN              <SHIFT+M>
    Switch to upper/lower case  <N>
    Switch to upper/graphics    <SHIFT+N>


    Holding down the <SHIFT> key and hitting <RETURN> causes a carriage-
  return and line-feed on the screen but does not end the string. This
  works with LIST as well as PRINT, so editing will be almost impossible if
  this character is used. When output is switched to the printer via the
  CMD statement, the reverse "N" character shifts the printer into its
  upper-lower case character set and the <SHIFT> "N" shifts the printer
  into the upper-case/graphics character set.
    Reverse video characters can be included in strings by holding down
  the ConTRoL <CTRL> key and pressing ReVerSe <RVS>, causing a reversed R
  to appear inside the quotes. This will make all characters print in
  reverse video (like a negative of a photograph). To end the reverse
  printing, press <CTRL> and <RVS OFF> (ReVerSe OFF) by holding down the
  <CTRL> key and typing the <RVS OFF> key, which prints a reverse R.
  Numeric data can be printed in reverse video by first printing a
  CHR$(18). Printing a CHR$(146) or a carriage-return will cancel reverse
  video output.

  GRAPHICS OVERVIEW

  All of the graphics abilities of the Commodore 64 come from the 6567
  Video Interface Chip (also known as the VIC-II chip). This chip gives a
  variety of graphics modes, including a 40 column by 25 line text display,
  a 320 by 200 dot high resolution display, and SPRITES, small movable
  objects which make writing games simple. And if this weren't enough,
  many of the graphics modes can be mixed on the same screen. It is
  possible, for example, to define the top half of the screen to be in
  high resolution mode, while the bottom half is in text mode. And SPRITES
  will combine with anything! More on sprites later. First the other
  graphics modes.
    The VIC-II chip has the following graphics display modes:



  A) CHARACTER DISPLAY MODES

     1) Standard Character Mode
            a)ROM characters
            b)RAM programmable characters
     2) Multi-Color Character Mode
            a)ROM characters
            b)RAM programmable characters

     3) Extended Background Color Mode
            a)ROM characters
            b)RAM programmable characters


  B) BIT MAP MODES

     1) Standard Bit Map Mode
     2) Multi-Color Bit Map Mode


  C) SPRITES

     1) Standard Sprites
     2) Multi-Color Sprites
