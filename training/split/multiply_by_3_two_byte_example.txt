# 6502 Multiplication and Division Algorithms - Source: llx.com - Step-by-step two-byte assembly code to multiply a two-byte number by 3 using the identity 3x = 2x + x. Shows shifting the operand into RESULT and then adding the original low/high bytes with ADC to produce RESULT = 3*NUM.

two-byte numbers:


LDA NUM       ;Start with RESULT = 2*NUM
        ASL A
        STA RESULT
        LDA NUM+1
        ROL A
        STA RESULT+1
        CLC
        LDA NUM
        ADC RESULT
        STA RESULT
        LDA NUM+1
        ADC RESULT+1
        STA RESULT+1  ;RESULT = 3*NUM
