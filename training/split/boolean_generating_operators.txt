# Kick Assembler - Table 5.1: The standard set of operators that generate Boolean values. Includes operators: Equal (==), Not Equal (!=), Greater (>), Less (<), Greater than or equal (>=), Less than or equal (<=). For each operator the table shows the operator token, an example (e.g. a==b, a!=b, a>b, a<b, a>=b, a<=b) and a short description of when it returns true or false. Also includes notes that these operators are defined for numeric values and examples comparing booleans (e.g. .var b1 = true==true, .var b2 = true!=(10<20)).

Here is the standard set of operators for generating Booleans:

Table 5.1. Boolean generating Functions
Name

Operator

Example

Description

Equal

==

a==b

Returns true if a equals b,
otherwise false.

Not Equal

!=

a!=b

Returns true if a doesn't
equal b, otherwise false.

Greater

>

a>b

Returns true if a is greater
than b, otherwise false.

Less

<

a<b

Returns true if a is less than
b, otherwise false.

Greater than

>=

a>=b

Returns true if a is greater
than or equal to b, otherwise false.

Less than

<=

a<=b

Returns true if a is less or
equal to b, otherwise false.

All the operators are defined for numeric values, other values have defined a subset of the above. E.g. you can't
say that one boolean is greater than another, but you can see if they have the same values:
.var b1 = true==true
// Sets b1 to true
.var b2 = true!=(10<20) // Sets b2 to false
