# MACHINE - How to execute the assembled program from the monitor using .G address (e.g., .G 033C), expectations for output, and a simple extension exercise to print more characters.


Running the Program
-------------------

If necessary, move the cursor down to an empty line.  Type the command .G
033C and the program will run.  Again, it doesn't take long; the break back
to the MLM seems instantaneous.  Where's the letter H that we were supposed
to print?  It's hard to see, but it's there.  Look at your .G 033C command
and you'll see it.

Project for enthusiasts:  Can you add to the program and print HI?  The ASCII
code for the letter I is $49.  Can you add again and print HI on a separate
line?  The ASCII code for a RETURN is $0D.  Remember that you can find all
ASCII codes in Appendix D; look in the column marked ASCII.
