# COMMODORE 64 - Advice to remove REM statements to save space when finalizing programs; using variables to shorten repeated values or addresses (examples replacing POKE addresses with variables like V=54296), and general tip to use arrays/READ DATA for large data sets.


  USING VARIABLES

    If a number, word or sentence is used repeatedly in your program it's
  usually best to define those long words or numbers with a one or two
  letter variable. Numbers can be defined as single letters. Words and
  sentences can be defined as string variables using a letter and dollar
  sign. Here's one example:

  BEFORE CRUNCHING:                 AFTER CRUNCHING:

  10 POKE 54296,15                  10 V=54296:F=54273
  20 POKE 54276,33                  20 POKEV,15:POKE54276,33
  30 POKE 54273,10                  30 POKEF,10:POKEF,40:POKEF,70
  40 POKE 54273,40                  40 POKEV,0
  50 POKE 54273,70
  60 POKE 54296,0

  USING READ AND DATA STATEMENTS

    Large amounts of data can be typed in as one piece of data at a time,
  over and over again ... or you can print the instructional part of the
  program ONCE and print all the data to be handled in a long running list
  called the DATA statement. This is especially good for crowding large
  lists of numbers into a program.

  USING ARRAYS AND MATRICES

  Arrays and matrices are similar to DATA statements in that long amounts
  of data can be handled as a list, with the data handling portion of the
  program drawing from that list, in sequence. Arrays differ in that the
  list can be multi-dimensional
