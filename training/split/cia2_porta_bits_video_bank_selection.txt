# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - CIA #2 Port A bits 0-1 select the VIC-II 16K video memory bank: bit patterns choose which 16K block the VIC-II addresses (00 = Bank 3 $C000-$FFFF, 01 = Bank 2 $8000-$BFFF, 10 = Bank 1 $4000-$7FFF, 11 = Bank 0 $0000-$3FFF). Discussion of VIC-II limitation to 16K and overview of trade-offs for selecting different banks for graphics data.

                          Bits 0 and 1 of CIA #2 Port A have an extremely important function.
                          As mentioned in the section on the VIC-II chip (53248, $D000), the
                          video chip can address only 16K of memory at a time, and all graphics
                          data must be stored in that 16K block in order to be displayed.
                          Within this area, sprite graphics data may be placed in any of 256
                          groups of 64 bytes each.  Character data can be stored in any of eight
                          2K blocks.  Text screen memory may be in any of 16 1K areas, and
                          bitmap screen memory may be in either of two 8K sections.

                          When you turn the power on, the VIC-II uses the bottom 16K of memory
                          for graphics.  Unfortunately, this block of memory is also used
                          extensively for other important purposes.  Though some means of
                          eliminating these conflicts are discussed above, in many situations
                          you will want to change from the default 16K bank at the low end of
                          memory.

                          Bits 0 and 1 select the current 16K bank for video memory from the
                          four possible choices using the following bit patterns:

                              00 (bit value of 0) Bank 3 (49152-65535, $C000-$FFFF)
                              01 (bit value of 1) Bank 2 (32768-49151, $8000-$BFFF)
                              10 (bit value of 2) Bank 1 (16384-32767, $4000-$7FFF)
                              11 (bit value of 3) Bank 0 (0-16383, $0-$3FFF)

                          The technique for making this change from BASIC is discussed below.
                          But before we go ahead and start changing banks, let's briefly review
                          the contents of these areas, and the considerations for using them for
                          graphics.
