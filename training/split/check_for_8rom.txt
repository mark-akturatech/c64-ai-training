# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - CHECK FOR 8-ROM: Checks for an autostart ROM identifier at $8004-$8008 by comparing 5 bytes against the data at $FD10. Sets Z=1 if identical. Uses indexed LDA/CMP loops across five bytes.

                                *** CHECK FOR 8-ROM
                                Checks for the ROM autostart parameters at $8004-$8008. It
                                compares data with $fd10, and if equal, set Z=1.
