# 6502 Multiplication and Division Algorithms - Source: llx.com - Describes the general approach for constants that are not powers of two: form the constant as a sum of powers of two and add the shifted results. Notes that temporary memory is usually required to hold intermediate results.

Multiplying by a constant other than a power of two is more
difficult, but it can be done by adding up the results of several
power-of-two multiplications.  This will generally require the use of
temporary memory locations to hold intermediate results.


For example, consider multiplication by 3.  To do this, we note that
for any number x, 3x = 2x + x - that is, we
can multiply by three by multiplying by two, and adding the original
number to the result.  Of course this means the original number has to
be kept around somewhere so it will be available for the addition.  For
