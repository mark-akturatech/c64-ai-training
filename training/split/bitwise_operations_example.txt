# Kick Assembler - Introduces bitwise operators (and, or, exclusive or, bit shifting) for use in numeric expressions. Provides a short example declaring .var x=$12345678 and using .word x & $00ff, [x>>16] & $00ff to extract and mask bytes using bitwise AND and right shift.

You can also use bitwise operators to perform and, or, exclusive or, and bit shifting operations.
.var x=$12345678
.word x & $00ff, [x>>16] & $00ff // gives .word $0078, $0034
