# The MOS 6567/6569 video controller (VIC-II) and its application in the Commodore 64 - Doubled text lines: assertion of a Bad Line Condition between cycles 54-57 in the last raster line of a text line causes RC to be incremented again and the previous text line to be displayed twice (no new video matrix data read). This duplicates text lines on screen.

3.14.5. Doubled text lines
--------------------------

The display of a text line is normally finished after 8 raster lines,
because then RC=7 and in cycle 58 of the last line the sequencer goes to
idle state (see section 3.7.2.). But if you now assert a Bad Line Condition
between cycles 54-57 of the last line, the sequencer stays in display state
and the RC is incremented again (and thus overflows to zero). The VIC will
then in the next line start again with the display of the previous text
line. But as no new video matrix data has been read, the previous text line
is simply displayed twice.
