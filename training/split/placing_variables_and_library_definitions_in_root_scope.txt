# Kick Assembler - Shows more examples of using '@' to place variables and definitions in the root scope from within another scope. Examples: .label @x = 1234, .var @y = "Hello world", .const @z = true. Also shows a library file (mylib.lib) using .filenamespace MyLibrary with .function @myFunction(), .macro @MyMacro(), and .macro @MyPseudoCommand to export root-level entities.

loop:
sta $0400,x
sta $0500,x
sta $0600,x
sta $0700,x
inx
bne loop
rts
}

The above code fills the screen with black spaces. The code that calls the clearScreen subroutine use
clearScreen.fillbyte to access the fillbyte label. If you use the label directive to define the fillbyte label, the code
can be done a little nicer:
lda #’a’
sta clearScreen2.fillbyte
jsr clearScreen2
rts
ClearScreen2: {
.label fillbyte = *+1
lda #0
ldx #0
loop:
sta $0400,x
sta $0500,x
sta $0600,x
sta $0700,x
inx
bne loop
rts
