# Contents - Principles for scoring systems: display the score constantly, award points for actions that help the player toward the goal, vary point values by action and difficulty level, and use sound cues to indicate score events. Consider bonuses to tempt certain behavior. Scoring values are subjective and usually refined during testing.

SCORING 

A player can tell how well he is doing by look- 
ing at the score. Almost all games should have a 
score of one sort or another. A player should be 
awarded points for actions that help him toward the 
goal of the game. The number of points awarded 
can vary greatly for different types of actions and 
can even be based on the current level of difficulty. 
In most cases, you will want to display the score con- 
stantly so that the player can tell how he is doing. 

Usually, when an action results in points being 
added to the score, some appropriate sound effect 
is generated. This sound serves to inform the player 
that he has done something good without forcing 
him to look at the score. Under some circumstances, 
a bonus should be awarded for completing a specific 
task. Bonuses are often used to tempt a player into 
a course of action, for some immediate points, which 
is not necessarily beneficial in the long run. 

Deciding on the number of points to award for 
the various actions is very subjective. You want a 
normal score to be high enough to make the player 
feel that he has accomplished something, but not 
so high as to be incomprehensible. You will probably 
not decide on your final scoring method on your first 
try, but will refine it during the testing process.
