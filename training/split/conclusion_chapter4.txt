# byRiclianll - Conclusion to chapter 4: warns that recovering a damaged file or tampering with directory structure requires full understanding of directory layout and storage mechanisms; advise caution.



Conclusion 

The  material  covered  in  this  chapter  is  primarily  of  academic  interest.  However,  do  not 
attempt  to  recover  a  blown  file  unless  you  thoroughly  understand  the  structure  of  the 
directory  and  how  files  are  stored.
