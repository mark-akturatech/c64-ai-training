# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Wrapper at $FF9C that JMPs to $FE34 to read or set the bottom of memory (carry semantics).

                                *** read/set the bottom of memory
                                this routine is used to read and set the bottom of RAM. When this routine is
                                called with the carry bit set the pointer to the bottom of RAM will be loaded
                                into XY. When this routine is called with the carry bit clear XY will be saved as
                                the bottom of memory pointer changing the bottom of memory.
