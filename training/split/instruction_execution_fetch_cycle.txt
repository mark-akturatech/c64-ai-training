# MACHINE - Describes the instruction fetch/execute cycle: PC places an address on the address bus, PC increments, memory returns the instruction on the data bus, the CPU executes it, then repeats with the next PC. Includes diagram Figure 1.6 and explanation of sequential execution and branching.

Instruction Execution
---------------------

Suppose that the 650x is stopped (not an easy trick), and that there is a
certain address, say $1234, in the PC.  The moment we start the micro-
computer, that address will be put out to the address bus as a read address,
and the processor will add one to the value in the PC.

Thus, the contents of address $1234 will be called for, and the PC will
change to $1235.  Whatever information comes in on the data bus will be taken
to be an instruction.

The microprocessor now has the instruction, which tells it to do something.
The action is performed, and the whole action now repeats for the next
instruction.  In other words, address $1235 will be sent to memory, and the
PC will be incremented to $1236.
