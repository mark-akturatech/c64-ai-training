# byRiclianll - Short guidance for recovering a relative (REL) file (section 8.4): open the REL file for read and copy record-by-record into a sequential file, skipping records that trigger errors so only intact records are preserved. Advises contacting an experienced programmer if you do not know how to perform record-by-record copying. (This chunk also covers trailing blank/page lines surrounding section 8.4.)

8.4  Recovering  a  Relative  File 

The  only  realistic  way  to  recover  a  REL  file  is  to  open  it  for  a  read  and  copy  it  record 
by  record  into  a  sequential  file.  The  program  to  do  this  should  not  abort  when  an  error 
is  encountered.  Simply  skip  over  the  record  and  go  on.  This  way  only  the  records  that 
reside,  in  whole  or  in  part,  on  the  damaged  sector  are  not  recovered.  If  you  do  not  know 
how  to  do  this,  take  your  diskette  to  an  experienced  programmer  and  see  if  he/she  can 
assist  you.
