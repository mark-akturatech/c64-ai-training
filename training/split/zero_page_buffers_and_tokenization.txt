# Commodore 64 Complete Memory Map - Source: sta.c64.org - Zero Page $0007-$000F: various byte buffers and tokenization/state flags used by BASIC. Includes search/input byte buffers ($0007-$0008), column counter ($0009), LOAD/VERIFY switch ($000A), token/array counters ($000B-$000C), expression and numerical type flags ($000D-$000E), and quotation mode ($000F).

$0007   Byte Buffer             Search byte, input digit, operand low byte
$0008   Byte Buffer             Search byte, tokenization byte, operand high byte
$0009   Column Counter          Current column during SPC() and TAB()
$000A   LOAD/VERIFY             Switch for load vs. verify operations
$000B   Token/Array             Current token or array dimension count
$000C   Array Switch            DIM operation indicator
$000D   Expression Type         Numerical ($00) or string ($FF)
$000E   Numerical Type          Floating point (0) or integer (1)
$000F   Quotation Mode          Mode indicator during tokenization/listing
