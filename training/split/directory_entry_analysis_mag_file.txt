# byRiclianll - Interpretation of the directory entry for 'MAG FILE': identifies the $84 file type (relative), shows that the sequential data portion starts at track 17 ($11), sector 03 ($03), and that the first side sector begins at track 17, sector 13 ($0D). Also extracts the record length byte ($96 = 150), indicating each record is exactly 150 bytes long.


Here's  the  entry 
for  the  REL  file: 


"MAG  FILE"  will  serve  as  our  demo  throughout  this  section.  Let's  examine  its  direc- 
tory entry  in  detail  from  track  18,  sector  1.

From  the  directory  entry  we  can  see  that  "MAG  FILE"  is  a  relative  file.  A  relative 
file  is  indicated  by  an  $84  as  the  file  type.  The  track  and  sector  pointers  in  the  directory 
reveal  that  "MAG  FILE"  starts  at  track  17  ($11),  sector  03  ($03).  This  is  the  sequential 
data  file  portion  of  the  relative  file.  It  is  the  beginning  of  our  data.

Record  length 

Side  sector  information  follows  the  file  name.  The  first  side  sector  begins  at  track  17 
($11),  sector  13  ($0D).  In  addition,  we  see  our  record  length  ($96=150).  Each  record  in 
our  sequential  data  file  is  150  bytes  long.  This  is  fixed  throughout  the  entire  data  file.
