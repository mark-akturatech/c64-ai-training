# ********* - Explains RODATA ($B6), the RS-232 output byte buffer. RS-232 routines disassemble each byte to be transmitted from the transmission buffer (pointed to by $F9) into this area so bits can be shifted out.

182           $B6            RODATA
RS-232 Output Byte Buffer

RS-232 routines use this area to disassemble each byte to be sent from
the transmission buffer pointed to by 249 ($F9).
