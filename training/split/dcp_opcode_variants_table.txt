# NMOS 6510 - Opcode table entries for the undocumented DCP (also called DCM) instruction. Lists DCP addressing modes and their encoded bytes, instruction sizes, cycle counts and addressing flags for: DCP zp,x ($C3), DCP (zp,x) ($D3), DCP (zp),y ($CF), DCP abs ($DF), DCP abs,x ($DB) and DCP abs,y (fields shown). This chunk contains the per-form fields (size, cycles, addressing characteristics, opcode bytes) for each addressing mode.
