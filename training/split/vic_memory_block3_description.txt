# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - VIC-II bank/block 3 description (49152-65535 / Block 3): normally contains free RAM, I/O registers, and the 8K Kernal ROM. Useful for lots of graphics and BASIC program space; character ROM unavailable but can be copied to RAM. Warning about DOS support code residing at 52224 ($CC00) and potential conflicts if using 52224-53247 for graphics.

                          Block 3.  Normally Block 3 contains 4K of RAM that is completely
                          unused by the system, 4K if I/O registers, and the 8K Operating System
                          Kernal ROM.  It is very convenient to use when you need a lot of
                          memory space for both graphics and a BASIC program.  Although the
                          character ROM is not available, it can be copied to RAM.  The area
                          under the Kernal ROM can be used as explained above.  One possible
                          conflict that you should be aware of is that the current version of
                          the DOS support program is written to reside at 52224 ($CC00).  It
                          would be safest to avoid using 52224-53247 for graphics if you plan to
                          use DOS support.
