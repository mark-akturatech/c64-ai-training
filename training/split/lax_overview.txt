# NMOS 6510 - Beginning of the LAX undocumented opcode entry. Describes LAX as a combination of LDA and LDX (same addressing mode performs both loads), shows opcode bytes ($A7, $B7) and mnemonic for zero-page addressing, and states the function (A,X = {addr}) along with size/cycle/flag header fields (partial header information present). This chunk is the intro/header for the LAX instruction entry and links conceptually to SAX as another combined operation opcode.
