# ********* - Explains the structure and conventions used for memory-map entries in the book: large blocks (e.g., 256-page areas or ROM ranges) with overviews, grouped Location Range sections for tightly related addresses, and individual entries showing decimal and hexadecimal addresses plus mnemonic labels. Describes the meaning and sources of labels (Commodore guide, Jim Butterfield's PET maps), one-line descriptions followed by detailed explanations or sample programs, and distinctions between flags, pointers, and vectors.

The Format of Entries

The entries in this book are organized at the most general level by
large blocks 9the 256 page 0 locations, for example, or the 8192
locations in the BASIC ROM).  At the beginning of these blocks, you
will often find an explanation that will give you an idea of how the
lcoations in that section are related.  Usually, this overview will
make it easier to understand the more detailed explanations of the
individual locations in that block.

Within these larger blocks, you will sometimes see a few locations
grouped under the heading Location Range.  This grouping is done where
the locations are so interrelated that it would be meaningless to try
to explain one without explaining them all.

Finally comes the entries for individual locations.  These give the
address, first in decimal, then in hexadecimal, and sometimes a label.
This label is merely a mnemonic device, used in machine language
programming, for easier reference to a particular memory location.
Although Commodore has not released the source code for their
Operating System or BASIC, they have published some of these labels in
the Commodore 64 Programmer's Reference Guide.

Other labels used here are taken from Jim Butterfield's PET memory
maps, which have enjoyed a wide circulation among Commodore users.
Their use here should help 64 owners adapt information about the PET
to their own machines.

The mnemonic label for an entry is followed by a one-line description
of the location.  Often, a more detailed explanation will appear under
that, ranging from a couple of sentences to several pages.
Occasionally, program samples will accompany these explanations.

Sometimes the single-line descriptions will identify a location as a
flag, a vector, or a pointer.  A flag is just a number that the
program uses to store the outcome of a previous operation.  A pointer
of vector is usually a two-byte location that holds a significant
address.  Generally, the term pointer is used when the address points
to the start of some data, and vector is used when the address points
to the start of a machine language program.  However, sometimes these
terms will be used interchangeably, with the meaning clear from the
context.
