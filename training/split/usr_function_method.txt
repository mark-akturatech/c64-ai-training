# COMMODORE 64 - Method 2: BASIC USR(X) — transfers control to machine routine pointed by low/high bytes at locations 785-786 ($0311-$0312). The BASIC numeric value X is passed via floating point accumulator #1 (at $61). Routine returns a value by placing it into floating point accumulator. Routine must end with RTS. Indirect vector must be changed if using multiple routines.

    2) The BASIC function USR(X) transfers control to the machine language
       subroutine located at the address stored in locations 785 and 786.
       (The address is stored in standard low-byte/high-byte format.) The
       value X is evaluated and passed to the machine language subroutine
       through floating point accumulator #1, located beginning at address
       $61 (see memory map for more details). A value may be returned back
       to the BASIC program by placing it in the floating point
       accumulator. The machine language routine must end with an RTS
       instruction to return to BASIC.
         This statement is different from the SYS, because you have to set
       up an indirect vector. Also different is the format through which
       the variable is passed (floating point format). The indirect vector
       must be changed if more than one machine language routine is used.
