# ********* - Practical example: determining record length for a mailing list with multiple fields (first name, last name, address lines, city/state/zip/phone) and rationale for adding separator bytes; describes starting the file with a record number tracker and shows beginning of a program to create/read mailing-list type relative files.


 5 X=0
 10 OPEN 1,8,15
 20 OPEN 2,8,3,"0:MAILING LIST,L," + CHR$(108)
 30 GOSUB 900
 40 PRINT#1 "P" CHR$(3+96) CHR$(1) CHR$(0) CHR$(1)
 50 GOSUB 900
 60 IF E=50 THEN PRINT#2,1:GOTO 40
 70 INPUT#2,X
 75 PRINT X
 300 STOP:CLOSE 1:CLOSE 2:END
 900 INPUT#1,E,B$,C,D: REM ERROR SUBROUTINE
 910 IF (E=50) OR (E<20) THEN RETURN
 920 PRINT E;B$;C;D:STOP:RETURN

Error #50 which is checked in line 60 of the program is the RECORD NOT
PRESENT error, which means that the record hadn't been created yet.
Writing into the record will solve the problem.  This error condition
must be watched carefully within your programs.

So far, all it does is create the file and the first record, but
doesn't actually put any data in it.  Below is a greatly expanded
version of the program, to actually allow you to work with a mailing
list where the records are coded by numbers.
