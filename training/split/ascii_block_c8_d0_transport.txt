# byRiclianll - ASCII-text region starting at C8: and continuing through D0: (notated as 'do:' in the dump). Contains hex values mapping to ASCII fragments such as 'ITING' and 'ANSPORTA' — parts of higher-level text (example: fragments of 'WRITING' and 'TRANSPORT'). This chunk shows how string data is laid out across these offsets.
