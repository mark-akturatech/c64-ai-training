# CIA 6526 Complex Interface Adapter - Comprehensive Reference - Serial Data Register (SDR) at offset $0C: an 8-bit bidirectional shift register used for synchronous serial I/O. Output mode (CRA bit 6 = 1): data written to SDR is shifted out MSB-first on SP, with Timer A underflows providing the shift clock (CNT outputs the shift clock at half Timer A rate); interrupt on byte complete. Input mode (CRA bit 6 = 0): external clock on CNT shifts data in on SP on positive CNT edges; interrupt on 8 bits received; read received byte from SDR.

5.7  Serial Data Register (SDR) - Offset $0C
-------------------------------------------------------------

The 8-bit shift register provides a bidirectional serial port.

Output Mode (CRA bit 6 = 1):
  - Data written to SDR is shifted out bit-by-bit on the SP pin.
  - Timer A underflows provide the shift clock (one bit per
    underflow). The actual clock appears on the CNT pin at half
    the Timer A underflow rate.
  - An interrupt is triggered when all 8 bits have been shifted out.
  - Writing new data before completion starts a new byte immediately
    after the current byte finishes.

Input Mode (CRA bit 6 = 0):
  - External clock is supplied on the CNT pin.
  - Data is shifted in on the SP pin on each positive CNT edge.
  - An interrupt is triggered when 8 bits have been received.
  - The received data can then be read from SDR.
