# MACHINE - Explains problems saving machine-language code stored in the cassette buffer on VIC/64: SAVE-to-tape may overwrite the cassette buffer; some disk commands also use that buffer and may destroy the program. Notes that pointer issues related to BASIC variables when saving/loading are discussed in Chapter 6.


A Comment on SAVE
-----------------

If you wished to save the program to cassette tape, you'd have a problem on
the VIC or Commodore 64.  The machine language program is in the cassette
buffer; a save-to-tape command would cause the contents of the buffer to be
destroyed before the program could be written to tape.  Even disk commands
would not be completely safe:  4.0 BASIC disk commands use the cassette
buffer area as a work area; using these commands would probably destroy our
machine language program.

But saving the program is not the main problem.  A correctly saved program
can give trouble when you try to bring it back and run it safely.  The
difficulty is related to BASIC pointers, especially the start-of-variables
pointer.  The problem, and how to solve it, will be discussed in some detail
in Chapter 6.
