# ********* - Sections 7.5–7.6: Summary of relative-file program behavior (function keys, error-channel handling, printing options) and guidance for modifying the sample program — adding fields via extra POSITION commands, changing record length via CHR$(n), and remarks about access limits and record indexing for large files (up to 720 records, special considerations for >256 or >512 records).

WRITE TO A RELATIVE FILE

LINE 60: Use the PRINT# statement after the POSITION command to move
to character position 1, as specified in LINE 30 -- CHR$(1).

READ FROM A RELATIVE FILE

LINE 130: Specify the character position using the POSITION command.
Then follow it with LINE 160, the INPUT# statement.

7.5 SUMMARY

In this program, you press the f1 key and a RELative file is created
on disk.  You can type RUN and press the f3 key to READ the previous
RELative file.  If an error condition exists (flashing red light on
the disk drive) you can hit the RUN/STOP key, type RUN and press the
f5 key.  This reads the ERROR CHANNEL from the drive, shows the error
number and message, as well as the track and sector of the error.  It
then resets the drive for use.  Later on the program asks if the file
should be printed.  To Print the file, press the f7 key when prompted,
or press C to continue.

REMEMBER:

1) Before a file can be written to, or read from, a POSITION command
must be executed.

2) You must always use PRINT#1 with the POSITION command. This puts
your data under command channel control.

3) The FIRST character string code in the POSITION command must
correspond to the THIRD number (channel #) in the OPEN statement.
Except OPEN 1, 8, 15 (see lines 8 and 30 of above program).

4) For convenience, use the FOR ... NEXT loop variable in the SECOND
character string, CHR$(I), of the POSITION command where I equals the
record number (see lines 20 and 30 of above program).

7.6 MODIFYING THE PROGRAM

1) You can add more POSITION commands to make more fields within each
record. Remember to include the character position number as the last
CHR$, when adding fields.

2) To change the length of each record, change the value of CHR$(50)
in LINE 8.

3) The number of records in the file is determined by the POSITION
command. The current example can process 5 records; the FOR ... NEXT
loop variable is 1 to 5. The program can process 720 records, but in
order to use more than 512 records, the number 2 must be in the THIRD
CHR$() of the POSITION command.  For more than 256, use the number 1.
For up to 256 records, simply use the FOR ... NEXT loop variable.
EXAMPLE: FOR I=1 TO 256 may access 256 records.
