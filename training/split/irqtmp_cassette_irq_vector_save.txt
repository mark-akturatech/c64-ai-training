# - C64 RAM Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $029F-$02A0 IRQTMP: save area for the IRQ vector while cassette I/O routines are hooked into the interrupt. Explains why the old IRQ vector is saved (so keyboard scanning, clock, STOP key, cursor blink can be restored) and that these functions are suspended during tape I/O.

$029F-$02A0  IRQTMP  Save Area for IRQ Vector During Cassette I/O
                     
                     The routines that read and write tape data are driven by an IRQ
                     interrupt.  In order to hook one of these routines into the interrupt,
                     the RAM IRQ vector at 788-789 ($0314-$0315) must be changed to point to
                     the address at which it starts.  Before that change is made, the old
                     IRQ vector address is saved at these locations, so that after the tape
                     I/O is finished, the interrupt that is used for scanning the keyboard,
                     checking the stop key, and updating the clock can be restored.
                     
                     You will note that all of the above functions will be suspended during
                     tape I/O.
