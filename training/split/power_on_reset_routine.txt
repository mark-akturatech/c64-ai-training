# ********* - Power-on RESET routine behavior (vector at $FFFC): sets interrupt disable, stack pointer, clears decimal flag, tests for autostart cartridge and jumps to cartridge cold start if present; otherwise calls Kernal init routines (IOINIT, RAMTAS, RESTOR, CINT), clears interrupt disable, and enters BASIC via the cold start vector.

Power-On Reset Routine

This is the RESET routine which is pointed to by the 6510 hardware
RESET vector at 65532 ($FFFC).

This routine is automatically executed when the computer is first
turned on.  First, it sets the Interrupt disable flag, sets the stack
pointer, and clears the Decimal mode flag.  Next, it tests for an
autostart cartridge.  If one is found, the routine immediately jumps
through the cartridge cold start vector at 32768 ($8000).  If no
cartridge is found, the Kernal initialization routines IOINIT, RAMTAS,
RESTOR, and CINT are called, the Interrupt disable flag is cleared,
and the BASIC program is entered through the cold start vector at
40960 ($A000).
