# Commodore IEC Serial Bus Protocol Reference - pagetable.com - Practical examples of TALK/LISTEN/SECOND/OPEN/CLOSE sequences: reading from device 8 channel 2 (TALK $48, SECOND $62, UNTALK $5F), writing to device 4 channel 7 (LISTEN $24, SECOND $67, UNLISTEN $3F), and device-to-device transfer (LISTEN printer, TALK disk, SECOND channel).

Practical Command Sequence Examples:

  Reading from device 8, channel 2:
    $48  (TALK device 8:    $40 + 8)
    $62  (SECOND channel 2: $60 + 2)
    [controller reads bytes from device until EOI]
    $5F  (UNTALK)

  Writing to device 4, channel 7:
    $24  (LISTEN device 4:  $20 + 4)
    $67  (SECOND channel 7: $60 + 7)
    [controller sends bytes with final byte using EOI]
    $3F  (UNLISTEN)

  Device-to-device transfer (disk 8 to printer 4):
    $24  (LISTEN device 4:  $20 + 4)
    $48  (TALK device 8:    $40 + 8)
    $62  (SECOND channel 2: $60 + 2)
    [device 8 autonomously transmits to device 4]
    $5F  (UNTALK)
    $3F  (UNLISTEN)
