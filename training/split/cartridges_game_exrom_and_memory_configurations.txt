# ********* - Notes that Bits 0-2 aren't the only means to control memory mapping: expansion cartridges use GAME and EXROM lines on the expansion port to replace ROM/RAM segments. Describes possible cartridge mappings (8K at $8000-$9FFF, 8K at $A000-$BFFF replacing BASIC, 8K at $E000-$FFFF replacing Kernal, or 16K at $8000-$BFFF/$8000-$C000) and explains the Max-emulation mode when cartridge ROM replaces the Kernal (only first 6K RAM used, no access to character ROM, graphics data remapped from $E000 down to $2000). References the Commodore 64 Programmer's Reference Guide for more hardware details.

It should be noted that while Bits 0-2 of this register allow software
control of some signals that determine the memory configuration that
is used by the Commodore 64 at any given time, they are not the only
determining factor.  Signals can also be generated by means of plug-in
expansion cartridges which are connected to the expansion port, and
these can change the memory map.

Two lines located on the exapansion port are called GAME and EXROM.
When used in conjunction with the software-controlled lines noted
above, these two hardware lines can enable cartridge ROM to replace
various segments of ROM and/or RAM.

Possible configurations include 8K of cartridge ROM to be switched in
at $8000-$9FFF, for a BASIC enhancement program; an 8K cartridge ROM
at $A000-$BFFF, replacing BASIC, or at $E000-$FFFF, replacing the
Kernal, or a 16k cartridge at $8000-$C000.

When cartridge ROM is selected to replace the Kernal, a Max emulator
mode is entered, which mimics the specification of the ill-fated Max
Machine, a game machine which Commodore never produced for sale int he
U.S.  In this mode, only the first 6K of RAM are used, there is no
access to the character ROM, and graphics data such as charactger
dot-data is mapped down from 57344 ($E000) to 8192 ($2000).  Further
hardware information may be obtained from the Commodore 64
Programmer's Reference Guide.
