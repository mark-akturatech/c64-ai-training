# ********* - Describes CIA #1 Data Port A (Port A) role selecting which paddles SID reads and reading paddle fire buttons. Bit 7=1 & Bit 6=0 -> SID reads paddles on Port 1; Bit 7=0 & Bit 6=1 -> SID reads paddles on Port 2. Notes conflict with keyscan (CIA #1 Data Port A used for keyscan writes) and necessity to disable keyscan IRQ to get accurate paddle readings. Also explains paddle fire buttons are read at CIA #1 Data Ports A and B: paddles on Controller Port 1 via Data Port B (56321,$DC01), Controller Port 2 via Data Port A (56320,$DC00). Fire buttons use Bits 2 and 3 (bit reads 0 when pushed).

As if all of the above were not enough, Port A is also used to control
which set of paddles is read by the SID chip, and to read the paddle
fire buttons.  Since there are two paddles per joystick Controller
Port, and only two SID registers for reading paddle positions, there
has to be a method for switching the paddle read from joystick Port 1
to joystick Port 2.

When Bit 7 of Port A is set to 1 and Bit 6 is cleared to 0, the SID
registers will read the paddles on Port 1.  When Bit 7 is set to 0 and
Bit 6 is set to 1, the paddles on Port 2 are read by the SID chip
registers.  Note that this also conflicts with the keyscan routine,
which is constantly writing different values to CIA #1 Data Port A in
order to select the keyboard column to read (most of the time, the
value for the last column is written to this port, which coincides
with the selection of paddles on joystick Port 1).  Therefore, in
order to get an accurate reading, you must turn off the keyscan IRQ
and select which joystick port you want to read.  See POTX at 54297
($D419), which is the SID register where the paddles are read, for the
exact technique.

Although the SID chip is used to read the paddle settings, the fire
buttons are read at CIA #1 Data Ports A and B.  The fire buttons for
the paddles plugged into Controller Port 1 are read at Data Port B
(56321, $DC01), while those for the paddles plugged into Controller
Port 2 are read from Data Port A (56320, $DC00).  The fire buttons are
read at Bit 2 and Bit 3 of each port (the same as the joystick left
and joystick right switches), and as usual, the bit will read 0 if the
corresponding button is pushed, and 1 if it is not.

Although only two of the rout paddle values can be read at any one
time, you can always read all four paddle buttons.  See the game
paddle input description at 54297 ($D419) for the BASIC statements
used to read these buttons.
