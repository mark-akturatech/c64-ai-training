# MACHINE - Discusses selecting a RAM location for the test program: suggests cassette buffer starting at $033C (decimal 828) for short test programs, and notes the need to use a machine language monitor to enter the code into RAM.


Choosing a Location
-------------------

We must find a suitable location for our program.  It must be placed into RAM
memory, of course, but where?

For the moment, we'll place our program into the cassette buffer, starting at
address $033C (decimal 828).  That's a good place to put short test programs,
which is what we will be writing for a while.

Now that we've made that decision, we face a new hurdle: how do we get the
program in there?  To do that, we need to use a machine language monitor.
