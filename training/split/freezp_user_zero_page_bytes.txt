# ********* - FREEZP ($FB-$FE) — Four free zero-page bytes reserved for user programs. Explains that these four bytes are guaranteed not to be altered by BASIC, making them suitable for user-written machine-language routines that require zero-page addressing; other zero-page locations may be used but are not guaranteed safe.

251-254       $FB-$FE        FREEZP
Four Free Bytes of Zero Page for User Programs

These locations were specifically set aside for user-written ML
routines that require zero-page addressing.  While other zero-page
locations can be used on a noninterference basis, it is guaranteed
that BASIC will not alter these locations.
