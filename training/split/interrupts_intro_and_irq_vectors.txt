# MACHINE - Introduction to interrupts (NMI, IRQ, BRK). Gives IRQ vector addresses: PET/CBM $0090-$0091 (dec 144-145) and VIC/Commodore 64 $0314-$0315 (dec 788-789). Discusses why changing the IRQ vector affects system services (clock, keyboard, cassette motor, cursor, input) and the need to preserve normal interrupt service when adding your own handler.
