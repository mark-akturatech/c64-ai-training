.,FF41 EA       NOP             waste cycles
.,FF42 EA       NOP             waste cycles

                                *** save the status and do the IRQ routine
.,FF43 08       PHP             save the processor status
.,FF44 68       PLA             pull the processor status
.,FF45 29 EF    AND #$EF        mask xxx0 xxxx, clear the break bit
