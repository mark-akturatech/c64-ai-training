# Contents - Advice to disable other interrupt sources before enabling your own ISR: because enabling your interrupt routine effectively disables the C64 OS, first turn off all other interrupt sources so the cause of an interrupt is easy to find; many OS functions are unnecessary or can be done differently in games.

Before enabling your interrupt routine and 
thereby disabling the Commodore 64's operating 
system, you should disable all other sources of in- 
terrupts in the machine. Once this is done, you can 
always find the cause of the interrupt easily. Most 
of the functions performed by Commodore's 
operating system either are unnecessary in a game 
or can be done in a different manner.
