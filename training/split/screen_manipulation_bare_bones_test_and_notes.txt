# MACHINE - Testing the screen manipulation routine: disassemble and run from BASIC using a loop to call machine code by SYS. Notes on slowing output with BASIC loops. Project ideas: change which columns or selectively affect characters (e.g., only 'S'). Note for VIC/C64: color nybble memory may need adjustment when POKEing screen memory.

Disassemble and check it.  Again, you'll find that the code occupies more
than one full screen.  Return to BASIC.

This time, we'll write a small BASIC program to exercise the machine language
code.  Type NEW to clear out any old BASIC code, and enter

  100 FOR J=1 TO 10
  110 SYS 828
  120 FOR K=1 TO 200
  130 NEXT K,J

The extra loop is to slow things down.  Machine language runs so fast that
the effect might not be properly visible if run at full speed.

Project for enthusiasts:  Can you change the program to do a different set of
columns?  Could you change it so that it affected only the letter "S"
wherever it appeared on the screen?


Comment for VIC-20 and Commodore 64
-----------------------------------

This exercise will work as intended.  Other types of screen work might call
for you to set the color nybble memory values before you can successfully
work directly with screen memory.  The rules for machine language are no
different from those for BASIC:  if you wish to POKE to the screen, you may
need to take the color nybble area into account.
