# COMMODORE 64 - INTERRUPTS (/IRQ): explains the VIC-II interrupt output behavior. The /IRQ line is driven low when an enabled internal source triggers an interrupt. The /IRQ output is open-drain and requires an external pull-up resistor. (Includes adjacent blank lines from source for continuity.)

  INTERRUPTS (/IRQ)

    The interrupt output, /IRQ, is brought low when an enabled source of
  interrupt occurs within the device. The /IRQ output is open drain,
  requiring an external pull-up resistor.
