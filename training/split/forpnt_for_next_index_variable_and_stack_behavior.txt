# ********* - FORPNT ($49-$4A) is a temporary pointer to the BASIC variable used as the loop index in FOR/NEXT. The variable address is first stored here, then pushed onto the stack, freeing FORPNT to be used as scratch space by statements like INPUT, GET, READ, LIST, WAIT, CLOSE, LOAD, SAVE, RETURN, and GOSUB. Refers to stack entry format at location 256 ($100) for FOR stack details.

73-74         $49-$4A        FORPNT
Temporary Pointer to the Index Variable Used by FOR

The address of the BASIC variable which is the subject of a FOR/NEXT
loop is first stored here, but is then pushed onto the stack.  That
leaves this location free to be used as a work area by such statements
as INPUT, GET, READ, LIST, WAIT, CLOSE, LOAD, SAVE, RETURN, and GOSUB.

For a description of the stack entries made by FOR, see location 256
($100).

- "opptr_math_operator_table_displacement" which expands on OPPTR is another temporary pointer used during expression evaluation (unrelated to FOR stack but similar use of page-zero temporaries)
