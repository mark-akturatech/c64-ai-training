# A 256 Byte Autostart Fast Loader for the Commodore 64 - Explanation of the original ROM loader's performance limits: bit-by-bit handshakes yielding ~400 bytes/sec, long load times for large programs, and periodic ROM-disabled interrupts that prevented background music.


The Speed Problem
-----------------

The original ROM implementation required software handshakes for every bit,
achieving only about 400 bytes per second. Loading a full 64 KB program took
over two minutes. Additionally, the ROM code disabled interrupts periodically,
preventing background music during disk operations.
