2.3  The  Command  Channel 

The  command  channel  (channel  number  15)  is  an  important  communication  link  between 
your  computer  and  the  1541  disk  drive.  It  has  several  important  functions.  You  can  use 
it  to: 


1.  Monitor  the  error  status  of  the  drive  to  ensure  that  everything  is  operating  properly. 

2.  Send  commands  that  direct  the  DOS  to  perform  various  housekeeping  chores 
associated  with  disk  handling. 

3.  Send  commands  that  direct  the  DOS  to  read  or  write  information  to  specific  areas 
on  a  diskette. 


This  chapter  focuses  on  the  first  two  of  these  uses.  Chapter  5  provides  more  detail  on 
reading  or  writing  to  a  diskette.
