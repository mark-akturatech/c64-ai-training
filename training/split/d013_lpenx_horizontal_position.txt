# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $D013 (53283) LPENX — Light Pen Horizontal Position (8-bit): provides horizontal value read from light pen, accurate only to every second dot (0..160). Multiply by 2 to approximate actual pixel X position.

$D013        LPENX        Light Pen Horizontal Position

                          This location holds the horizontal position of the light pen.  Since
                          there are only eight bits available (which give a range of 256 values)
                          for 320 possible horizontal screen positions, the value here is
                          accurate only to every second dot position.  The number here will
                          range from 0 to 160 and must be multiplied by 2 in order to get a
                          close approximation of the actual horizontal dot position of the light
                          pen.
