# ********* - Explains that CIA #1 Data Port B can act as an output controlled by Timer A or B: timers can be set so they do not generate interrupts but instead toggle or pulse Bit 6 (Timer A) or Bit 7 (Timer B) of Data Port B. Timer A can pulse Bit 6 for one machine cycle or toggle it; Timer B uses Bit 7 similarly.

Finally, Data Port B can also be used as an output by either Timer A
or B.  It is possible to set a mode in which the timers do not cause
an interrupt when they run down (see the descriptions of Control
Registers A and B at 56334-5 ($DC0E-F)).  Instead, they cause the
output on Bit 6 or 7 of Data Port B to change.  Timer A can be set
either to pulse the output of Bit 6 for one machine cycle, or to
toggle that bit from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1.  Timer B can use Bit 7 of this
register for the same purpose.
