# Contents - Sprite-to-sprite and sprite-to-background priorities: VIC predefines sprite-to-sprite priority (sprite 0 highest, sprite 7 lowest). Sprite-to-background priority is individually selected via BPRIOR ($D01B): clear bit -> sprite in front of background; set bit -> sprite behind background image (but in front of border color). Transparent areas let background or lower-priority sprites show through.


Assigning sprite priorities. As mentioned 
before, each sprite has a display priority with

You can create a three dimensional effect by allow 
ing different sprites to pass in front of each other 
The priority of one sprite to another is predeter- 
mined by the VIC chip. Sprite has the highest 
priority, meaning that it will appear to be in front 
of all other sprites. Sprite 7 has the lowest priority 
of all the sprites.
