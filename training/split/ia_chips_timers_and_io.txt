# MACHINE - IA chip functions continue: (2) timers on IA chips count down and often set interrupt flags on overflow; (3) input/output ports on IA chips connect to external devices with outputs typically latching (a store sets a port state). Advises reading full chip specs for details.

  2.  Timing.  Certain addresses within the IA chip are often assigned as
      "timers."  These timers count down; in other words, if we place a value
      of $97 into a timer and look at the value immediately, we might find
      that it has gone down to $93.  Timers come in many shapes and sizes--
      again, check the chip reference for details--but most of them toggle an
      interrupt flag when they have counted down to zero.  As discussed, you
      may choose whether or not this flag will really cause an interrupt
      signal.

                                                                        :122:

  3.  Input/output.  Certain addresses within the IA chip are connected to
      "ports," which extend outside the computer.  Thus, the computer can
      detect external events or control external devices.  Output signals are
      usually latching in nature:  in other words, a store command might be
      taken to mean, "turn on port 5 and leave it on."
