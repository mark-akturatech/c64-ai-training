# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Text editors and scroll text writers: tools to prepare scrolling text and support for custom page sizes for non-standard fonts or partial-screen displays.

Text Editors and Scroll Text Writers
In addition to the above, you need text editors, to edit your scroll texts and other texts in your demos. Some text editors let you set the size of the pages, which can be handy, if you're using fonts of non-standard sizes, or only use parts of the screen to display text.

Scroll text writers are used for (surprise) writing scroll texts, and are pretty similar to text editors.
