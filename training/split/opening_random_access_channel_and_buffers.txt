# ********* - Section 6.2: How to open the two channels needed for random access — command channel (15) and data channel (use "#" or "#buffer#" as file name). Examples showing OPEN syntax for selecting buffer numbers.

The DOS contains commands for reading and writing directly to any
track and block on the diskette.  There are also commands for checking
to see which blocks are available, and for marking off used blocks.

These commands are transmitted through the command channel (channel
#15), and tell the disk what to do with the data.  The data must be
read later through one of the open data channels.



6.2 OPENING A DATA CHANNEL FOR RANDOM ACCESS

When working with random access files, you need to have 2 channels
open to the disk: one for the commands, and the other for the data.
The command channel is OPENed to channel 15, just like other disk
commands you've encountered so far.  The data channel for random
access files is OPENed by selecting the pound sign (#) as the file
name.

FORMAT FOR OPEN STATEMENT FOR RANDOM ACCESS DATA:

   OPEN file#, device#, channel#, "#"

or optionally

   OPEN file#, device#, channel#, "#buffer#"

EXAMPLES OF OPENING RANDOM ACCESS DATA CHANNEL:

                         +-------------------------+
   OPEN 5,8,5,"#" <------+ DON'T CARE WHICH BUFFER |
			 +----------------+--------+
   OPEN A,B,C,"#2" <-----+ PICK BUFFER #2 |
		 	 +----------------+
