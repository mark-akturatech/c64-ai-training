# COMMODORE 64 - LIST [[first-line]-[last-line]]: displays lines of BASIC program currently in memory using screen editor. Behavior: defaults to entire program, can specify ranges with hyphen and single endpoint formats. Control keys: CTRL slows scrolling; RUN/STOP aborts LIST. LIST returns to READY; examples of LIST usage including using LIST in program.

  LIST

  TYPE: Command
  FORMAT: LIST [[<first-line>]-[<last-line>]]

    Action: The LIST command allows you to look at lines of the BASIC
  program currently in the memory of your Commodore 64. This lets you use
  your computer's powerful screen editor, to edit programs which you've
  LISTed both quickly and easily.
    The LIST system command displays all or part of the program that is
  currently in memory on the default output device. The LIST will normally
  be directed to the screen and the CMD statement can be used to switch
  output to an external device such as a printer or a disk. The LIST com-
  mand can appear in a program, but BASIC always returns to the system
  READY message after a LIST is executed.
    When you bring the program LIST onto the screen, the "scrolling" of
  the display from the bottom of the screen to the top can be slowed by
  holding down the ConTRoL <CTRL> key. LIST is aborted by typing the
  <RUN/STOP> key.
    If no line-numbers are given the entire program is listed. If only the
  first-line number is specified, and followed by a hyphen (-), that line
  and all higher-numbered lines are listed. If only the last line-number is
  specified, and it is preceded by a hyphen, then all lines from the
  beginning of the program through that line are listed. If both numbers
  are specified, the entire range, including the line-numbers LISTed, is
  displayed.

  EXAMPLES of LIST Command:

    LIST            (Lists the program currently in memory.)

    LIST 500        (Lists line 500 only.)

    LIST 150-       (Lists all lines from 150 to the end.)

    LIST -1000      (Lists all lines from the lowest through 1000.)

    LIST 150-1000   (Lists lines 150 through 1000, inclusive.)

    10 PRINT "THIS  IS LINE 10"
    20 LIST                             (LIST used in Program Mode)
    30 PRINT "THIS  IS LINE 30"
