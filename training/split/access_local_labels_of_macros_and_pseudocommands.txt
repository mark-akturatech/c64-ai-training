# Kick Assembler - Explains how placing a label before executing a macro or pseudocommand creates a label scope array so you can reference inner labels of the executed macro. Example: start: c1: c2: *=$1000 inc c1.color dec c2.color :setColor() :setColor() jmp start and macro .macro setColor() { .label color = *+1 lda #0 sta $d020 } allowing increment/decrement of macro-created labels.

jmp myIf.label
myIf: .if (true) {

label:
lda #0 // <-- Jumps here
...
} else {
...
label:
nop
...
}
