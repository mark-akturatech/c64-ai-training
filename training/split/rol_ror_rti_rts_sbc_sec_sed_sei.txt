# 6502 Instruction Set - ROL (rotate left) and ROR (rotate right) detailed opcodes for accumulator and memory forms. RTI (return from interrupt) and RTS (return from subroutine) semantics and opcodes. SBC (subtract with borrow) opcode table and flags behavior (A - M - C̅ -> A). Flag set instructions SEC, SED, SEI opcodes and semantics. Notes on cycles and a footnote indicating page crossing cycle additions.

           *** on the orginal NMOS CPU, the lookup of the effective address high-byte is
               always performed on the same memory page as the low-byte (e.g., "JMP ($11FF)"
               resolves to a lookup at $11FF for the low-byte and at $1100 for the high-byte)
               for the CMOS version, add 1 to cycle, if the address is at a page boundary
