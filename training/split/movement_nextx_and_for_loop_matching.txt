# COMMODORE 64 - Explains LINE 90: NEXT X — how the program moves the sprite across the screen only after changing its shape. Describes stepping the sprite 3 X positions at a time (instead of 1) to create faster, more 'dancelike' motion, and notes that NEXT X matches the FOR... X loop defined earlier (line 50).

  LINE 90:

    NEXTX               After the sprite has become one of the 3 different
                        shapes defined by the DATA, only then is it allowed
                        to move across the screen. It will jump 3 X
                        positions at a time (instead of scrolling smoothly
                        one position at a time, which is also possible).
                        STEPping 3 positions at a time makes the mouse
                        "dance" faster across the screen. NEXT X matches
                        the FOR... X position loop in line 50.
