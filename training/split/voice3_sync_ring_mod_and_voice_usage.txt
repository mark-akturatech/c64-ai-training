# COMMODORE 64 - Voice 3 control overview (registers $0E–$14): functionally identical to Voice 1 controls except SYNC synchronizes Oscillator 3 with Oscillator 2 and RING MOD replaces Oscillator 3's Triangle output with the ring-modulated combination of Oscillators 3 and 2. Typical voice operation: set frequency, waveform, effects (SYNC, RING MOD), and envelope rates; gate the voice to produce sound, sustain by holding the Gate bit, and stop by clearing it. Voices may be used independently or in unison (detuning and musical intervals create richer sounds).

  VOICE 3

    Registers $0E-$14 control Voice 3 and are functionally identical to
  registers 00-06 with these exceptions:

    1) When selected, SYNC synchronizes Oscillator 3 with Oscillator 2.
    2) When selected, RING MOD replaces the Triangle output of Oscillator 3
       with the ring modulated combination of Oscillators 3 and 2.

    Typical operation of a voice consists of selecting the desired parame-
  ters: frequency, waveform, effects (SYNC, RING MOD) and envelope rates,
  then gating the voice whenever the sound is desired. The sound can be
  sustained for any length of time and terminated by clearing the Gate bit.
  Each voice can be used separately, with independent parameters and
  gating, or in unison to create a single, powerful voice. When used in
  unison, a slight detuning of each oscillator or tuning to musical
  intervals creates a rich, animated sound.
