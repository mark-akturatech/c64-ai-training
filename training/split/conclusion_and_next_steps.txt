# Contents - Final remarks: summary that the book provides a strong foundation for writing games on the C64, encouragement to use appendix libraries and definition files to speed development, and a closing wish that readers enjoy writing and sharing games.


This concludes the introduction to arcade game 
programming on the Commodore 64. Just as in any 
other field, the best way to learn is by doing. In this 
book, you have been given a strong foundation on 
which to build your program. By using the various 
definition files and libraries from Appendix C, you 
can spend more time writing your game program 
and less time coding the groundwork. I hope that 
you find a great deal of enjoyment in writing games 
and sharing them with others, as we have.
