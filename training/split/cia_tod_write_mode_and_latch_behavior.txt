# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Behavior of the CIA Time-of-Day (TOD) write mode and latch: $DC0F bit controls whether writing TOD registers sets alarm or clock; writing hours latches/stops updates until tenths of seconds are written. Notes on BASIC RND using TOD seconds/tenths as seed and TOD's advantages over software clocks and IRQ-based timers (survives RESET, more accurate).

                          $DC0F).  If that bit is set to 1, writing to the Time of Day registers
                          sets the alarm.  If the bit is set to 0, writing to the Time of Day
                          registers sets the Time of Day clock.  In either case, as with reading
                          the registers, there is a latch function.  This function stops the
                          clock from updating when you write to the hours register.  The clock
                          will not start again until you write to the tenths of seconds
                          registers.

                          The only apparent use of the Time of Day Clock by the 64's Operating
                          System is in the BASIC RND statement.  There, the seconds and tenths
                          of seconds registers are read and their values used as part of the
                          seed value for the RND(0) command.

                          Nonetheless, this clock can be an invaluable resource for the 64 user.
                          It will keep time more accurately than the software clock maintained
                          at locations 60-162 ($A0-$A2) by the Timer A interrupt routine.  And
                          unlike that software clock, the Time of Day Clock will not be
                          disturbed when I/O operations disrupt the Timer A IRQ, or when the IRQ
                          vector is diverted elsewhere.  Not even a cold start RESET will
                          disrupt the time.  For game timers, just set the time for 00:00:00:0
                          and it will keep track of elapsed time in hours, minutes, seconds and
                          tenths of seconds format.
