# ********* - Section 3.6: SAVE-and-replace mechanism using the @0: prefix (e.g., SAVE "@0:TEST",8) which instructs DOS to mark the old entry deleted and create a new entry with the same name; explanation of the 0: compatibility with multi-drive systems.


3.6 SAVE AND REPLACE

If a program already exists on the disk, it is often necessary to make
a change and re-SAVE it onto the disk.  In this case, it would be
inconvenient to have to erase the old version of the program and then
SAVE it.

If the first characters of the program name are the "@" sign followed
by a 0 and a colon (:), the DOS knows to replace any old program that
has that name with the program that is now in the computer's memory.
The drive checks the directory to find the old program, then it marks
that entry as deleted, and it next creates a new entry with the same
name.  Finally, the program is stored normally.

FORMAT FOR SAVE WITH REPLACE:

   SAVE "@0:" + name$, device#, command#

For example, if a file was called TEST, the SAVE and replace command
would be SAVE "@0:TEST",8.  If the name is in A$, the command is SAVE
"@0:" + A$, 8.

The reason for the 0: is to keep compatibility with other Commodore
disk drive units which have more than one drive built in.  In that
case, the number 0 or 1 is used to specify which drive is being used.
