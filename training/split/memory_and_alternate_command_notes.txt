# byRiclianll - Additional notes on command ordering and alternate formats: mentions that memory-read/write may be used instead of B-P for some tasks, and that U1/U2 have alternate colon/comma forms. Also notes DOS attempts to rewrite BAM when closing direct-access channels and the error light behavior for write-protected or DOS-protected disks (error light remains until suppressed via reading error channel).


The  alternate  formats  of  the  block-read  command  (Ul)  in  line  160  are: 
PRINT#15, "Ul: "2;0; 18; o 

PRINT#15, "Ul:2,0, 18,0" 

Although  the  block-read  command  (Ul)  comes  in  three  basic  flavors,  line  160  uses  the 
preferred  format.  It  will  be  used  in  demonstration  programs  throughout  the  chapter 
for  consistency.  Alternate  formats  will  appear  in  passing. 

Additionally,  lines  210-220  are  often  combined  into  one  BASIC  statement  for  the  sake 
of  efficiency: 

A=ASC (B*+CHR* (0> ) 

Recall  that  lines  210-220  are  necessary  because  the  GET#  command  does  not  interpret 
nulls  correctly.
