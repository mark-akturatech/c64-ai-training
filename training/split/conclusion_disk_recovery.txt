# byRiclianll - Conclusion: recovering a damaged diskette is more art than science. The provided utilities and techniques are useful, but prevention (backups, careful operations) is easier than repair. Final admonition to keep backups and that creating errors is easier than fixing them.

Conclusion 

In  short,  recovering  a  damaged  diskette  is  more  art  than  science.  The  utilities  that  we 
have  presented  here  can  prove  invaluable  in  time  of  need.  When  all  is  said  and  done, 
however,  it  is  much  easier  to  create  errors  than  to  pick  up  the  pieces  afterward.
