# byRiclianll - The input/read loop that reads a half-page of data from the disk into memory and finishes the subroutine. Contains LDY #*00 to start Y at 0, label L00P2 with 'JSR CHRIN' to read a byte, 'STA (POINT),Y' to store the byte at (POINT),Y, 'INY' to increment the destination index, 'CPY #$81' and 'BNE L00P2' to loop until Y reaches $81 (end of half-page). After the loop it calls 'JSR CLRCHN' to clear the channel and 'RTS' to return from the subroutine.
