# ********* - INLIN: input a line to the BASIC text buffer from the current input device (usually the keyboard). Uses the Kernal CHRIN routine to read characters into the text input buffer at $200 (512) until carriage return or 89 characters; an error occurs if the line exceeds 80 characters (keyboard normally limited to 80).

Input a Line to Buffer from Keyboard

This subroutine calls the Kernal CHRIN routine (61783, $F157) to
obtain a line of input from the current input device (usually the
keyboard).  It stores the characters in the BASIC text input buffer at
512 ($200) until a carriage return or 89 characters have been
received.  The keyboard device will never return more than 80
characters before a carriage return, but other devices can output a
longer line.  An error will occur if the line goes over 80 characters.
