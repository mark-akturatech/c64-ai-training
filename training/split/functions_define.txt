# Kick Assembler - Chapter 7 and Section 7.1: Defining script .function functions (syntax, .return), examples (area, oddEven, clearList), behavior when no .return is reached (null), and function overloading based on argument count.


Chapter 7
Functions and Macros
This chapter shows how to group directives together in units for later execution. In other words, how to define
and use functions, macros and finally pseudo commands which are a special kind of macros.

7.1. Functions
You can define you own functions which you can use like any of the build in library functions. Here is an
example of a function:
.function area(width,height) {
.return width*height
}
.var x = area(3,2)
lda #10+area(4,8)

Functions consist of non-byte generating directives like .eval, .for, .var, and .if. When the assembler evaluates
the .return directive it returns the value given by the proceeding expression. If no expression is given, or if no .return
directive is reached, a null value is returned. Here are some more examples of functions:
// Returns a string telling if a number is odd or even
.function oddEven(number) {
.if ([number&1] == 0 ) .return “even”
else .return “odd”
}
// Inserts null in all elements of a list
.function clearList(list) {
// Return if the list is null
.if (list==null) .return
.for(var i=0; i<list.size(); i++) {
list.set(i,null)
}
}
// Empty function – always returns null
.function emptyFunction() {
}
