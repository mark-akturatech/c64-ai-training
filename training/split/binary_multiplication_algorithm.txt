# 6502 Multiplication and Division Algorithms - Source: llx.com - Binary multiplication algorithm: analogous to decimal but simpler because digits are 0/1. Algorithm: set answer to 0; for each bit in multiplier, remove rightmost bit; if bit==1 add multiplicand shifted appropriately to answer. Example binary multiplication (110 x 101) and explanation of 'stairstep' shift trick used in machine code implementations.

 The secret of binary multiplication is that it works exactly like
decimal multiplication, as long as you use the addition and
multiplication tables for binary digits:


+| 0  1      x| 0 1
--+-----     --+----
 0| 0  1      0| 0 0
 1| 1 10      1| 0 1


The algorithm in the binary case is slightly simpler than the decimal
algorithm:


  * Set the answer to 0.

  * Repeat as many times as there are bits in the bottom number:


  * Remove the rightmost bit of the bottom number.

  * If the bit removed was 1, add the top number to the answer,
      shifted one more place to the left each time.


Here's an example:
