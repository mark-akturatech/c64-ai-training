# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Classification of pulses into short/medium/long ranges by adding different offsets to min timing ($B0) and comparing with the computed max ($B1). Handles EOI (end-of-information) flag checks, may call the 'store the tape character' routine when a full byte is received, and branches to appropriate handlers for each pulse type. Uses constants added (#$30, #$26, #$2C) to discriminate B/C/D ranges.
