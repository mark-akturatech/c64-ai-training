# C64 KERNAL API (Lee Davison) - $FFCF — Input character from channel. Returns a byte from the currently opened input channel (set by CHKIN $FFC6). If the keyboard is the input, special handling occurs: cursor is shown and the logical line is buffered into BASIC input buffer (up to 80 chars) until carriage return; successive calls return characters one at a time. Channel remains open after call.

$FFCF          input character from channel
               
               This routine will get a byte of data from the channel already set up as the input
               channel by the CHKIN routine, $FFC6.
               
               If CHKIN, $FFC6, has not been used to define another input channel the data is
               expected to be from the keyboard. the data byte is returned in the accumulator. the
               channel remains open after the call.
               
               Input from the keyboard is handled in a special way. first, the cursor is turned on
               and it will blink until a carriage return is typed on the keyboard. all characters
               on the logical line, up to 80 characters, will be stored in the BASIC input buffer.
               then the characters can be returned one at a time by calling this routine once for
               each character. when the carriage return is returned the entire line has been
               processed. the next time this routine is called the whole process begins again.
