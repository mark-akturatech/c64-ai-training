# SID 6581/8580 Sound Interface Device - Programming Guide - SID register base address $D400 (54272), mirror range $D400-$D7FF (32-byte mirror), voice register offsets (Voice1 $D400-$D406, Voice2 $D407-$D40D, Voice3 $D40E-$D414), and note that registers $D400-$D418 are write-only except $D419-$D41C.

================================================================================

Base address: $D400 (54272 decimal)
Mirror range: $D400-$D7FF (SID registers repeat every 32 bytes on the C64)

All voice registers follow the same layout with offsets:
  Voice 1: $D400-$D406 (offset +$00)
  Voice 2: $D407-$D40D (offset +$07)
  Voice 3: $D40E-$D414 (offset +$0E)

Note: All SID registers are WRITE-ONLY except $D419-$D41C.
