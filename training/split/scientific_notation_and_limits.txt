# COMMODORE 64 - Details of floating-point scientific notation: mantissa, 'E' and exponent; exponent range (-39..+38), conversion meaning (move decimal), maximum/minimum representable values (+1.70141183E+38 max, +2.93873588E-39 min), overflow behavior, and examples converting exponential to decimal.

  the numbers are rounded to nine digits when results are printed. Some
  examples of simple floating-point numbers are:

                  1.23                 .7777777
                  -.998877         -333.
                 +3.1459               .01


    Numbers smaller than .01 or larger than 999999999. will be printed in
  scientific notation. In scientific notation a floating-point constant is
  made up of three parts:

    1) THE MANTISSA
    2) THE LETTER E
    3) THE EXPONENT

    The mantissa is a simple floating-point number. The letter E is used to
  tell you that you're seeing the number in exponential form. In other
  words E represents * 10 (eg., 3E3 = 3*10^3 = 3000). And the exponent is
  what multiplication power of 10 the number is raised to.
    Both the mantissa and the exponent are signed (+ or -) numbers. The
  exponent's range is from -39 to +38 and it indicates the number of places
  that the actual decimal point in the mantissa would be moved to the left
  (-) or right (+) if the value of the constant were represented as a
  simple number.
    There is a limit to the size of floating-point numbers that BASIC can
  handle, even in scientific notation: the largest number is
  +1.70141183E+38 and calculations which would result in a larger number
  will display the BASIC error message ?OVERFLOW ERROR. The smallest
  floating-point number is +2.93873588E-39 and calculations which result
  in a smaller value give you zero as an answer and NO error message. Some
  examples of floating-point numbers in scientific notation (and their
  decimal values) are:

 	235.988E-3	(.235988)
        2359E6          (2359000000.)
        -7.09E-12       (-.00000000000709)
	-3.14159E+5	(-314159.)
