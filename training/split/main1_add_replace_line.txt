# ********* - MAIN1: add or replace a line of program text. Calls subroutines to get the line number and tokenize keywords, searches for an existing line with the same number, deletes it by moving program text and variables downward, and then inserts the new tokenized line. Calls CLR which clears current program variables.

Add or Replace a Line of Program Text

This routine calls subroutines to get the line number, tokenize
keywords, and then looks for a line with the same line number.

If it finds a line with the same number, the routine deletes that line
by moving all higher program text and variables down to where it
started.  The new line is then added.  Since the CLR routine is
called, the value of all current program variables is lost.
