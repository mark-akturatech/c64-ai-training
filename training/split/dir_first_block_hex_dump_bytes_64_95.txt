# byRiclianll - Later middle portion of the hex/ASCII dump for the first data block (Track 16, Sector 01). This section contains tokenized BASIC fragments, identifiers and punctuation sequences (examples seen: "#1, A", list-like elements such as "A*,B*", and other token/ASCII mixed lines). It continues the byte-by-byte view through this block and highlights structured pieces of the stored content (variable names, delimiters, small data lists).
