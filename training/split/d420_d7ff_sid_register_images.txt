# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $D420-$D7FF — SID Register Images: SID decodes only 32 addresses; the 1K window is mirrored every 32 bytes. Advises using base SID addresses only to avoid confusion.

$D420-$D7FF               SID Register Images

                          Since the SID chip requires enough addressing lines for only 32
                          locations (the minimum possible for its 29 registers), none of the
                          higher bits are decoded when addressing the 1K area that has been
                          assigned to it.  The result is that every 32-byte area in this 1K
                          block is a mirror of every other.  For the sake of clarity in your
                          programs, it is advisable not to use these addresses at all.
