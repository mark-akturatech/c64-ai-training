# byRiclianll - Explains that the DOS does not zero unused bytes in a data block (they are 'garbage'), and notes two exceptions: partial directory blocks are padded with $00 and always appear as full blocks; bytes 0 and 1 of the last directory block contain $00 and $FF respectively. Mentions that relative file structure is handled differently (see relative_file_overview).

What  about  the  rest  of  the  block?  Ignore  it.  It  is  garbage.  The  DOS  does  not  zero  out 
a  buffer  before  it  begins  filling  it  with  new  information  sent  from  the  computer.  As  a 
result,  the  last  block  in  a  file,  which  is  almost  never  filled  with  new  information,  is  padded 
with  whatever  happened  to  be  left  in  the  buffer  from  a  previous  read  or  write  opera- 
tion. There  are  two  exceptions  to  the  rule,  namely,  the  directory  and  relative  files.  A 
partial  directory  block  is  always  padded  with  nulls  ($00).  Moreover,  it  always  appears 
as  a  full  block.  Bytes  0  and  1  of  the  last  directory  block  will  contain  a  $00  and  a  $FF, 
respectively.  Relative  file  structure  will  be  explained  shortly.
