# NMOS 6510 - Introductory explanation of how the undocumented ARR ($6B) opcode sets the Carry and Overflow flags: the resulting Carry equals bit 7 before (or bit 6 after) the rotate; the Overflow depends on whether the rotate changes bit 6. Indicates that a detailed mapping table follows.

resulting carry is however not influenced by the LSB as expected from a normal rotate. The Carry
will be equal to the state of bit 7 before (or bit 6 after) the rotate, the state of the overflow-flag
depends on whether the rotate changes bit 6, and will be set like shown in the following table:
