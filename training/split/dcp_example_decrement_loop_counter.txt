# NMOS 6510 - Code example showing how to use DCP to decrement a loop counter and compare it in one instruction. Demonstrates replacing a sequence of DEC/LDA/CMP/BNE with a single DCP-based compare and branch, saving code and cycles. Includes the small data definitions and the rewritten loop sequence.
