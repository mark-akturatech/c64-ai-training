# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - The unshifted keyboard decode table. Describes how the ASCII code for a pressed key is determined by the intersection of the row written to $DC00 and the column read from $DC01. Contains the 8x9 byte matrix of ASCII values for unshifted keys and a free byte ($FF) at the end.

                                *** KEYBOARD 1 - UNSHIFTED
                                This is the first of four keyboard decode tables. The
                                ASCII code for the key pressed is at the intersection of
                                the row (written to $dc00) and the column (read from
                                $dc01). The matrix values are shown below. Note that left
                                and right shift keys are separated.
