# ********* - Introduces the Commodore 64 memory model: 64K (65536) bytes of addressable memory, each byte stores 0–255, and any location is accessed by an address in the range 0–65535. Notes that memory locations can be read (and sometimes written) using these addresses.


The Commodore 64 and communicate with 64K or 65536 (64*1024) bytes of
memory.  Each of these bytes of memory can store a number from 0 to
255.  The computer can read (and sometimes write) information from any
of these 65536 locations by using its address, a number from 0 to
65535.
