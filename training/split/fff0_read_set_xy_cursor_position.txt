# C64 KERNAL API (Lee Davison) - $FFF0 — Read/Set X,Y cursor position. With carry=1 loads current cursor column (X) and row (Y) into registers. With carry=0 moves the cursor to position specified by X (column) and Y (row).

$FFF0          read/set X,Y cursor position
               
               This routine, when called with the carry flag set, loads the current position of
               the cursor on the screen into the X and Y registers. X is the column number of
               the cursor location and Y is the row number of the cursor. A call with the carry
               bit clear moves the cursor to the position determined by the X and Y registers.
