# Analyzing C64 tape loaders - Shows BASIC RAM vector area modified by the loader: notes that several BASIC routines are vectored through RAM and the loader changes those vectors to autostart when CBM file fully loads. Contains example bytes and comments about autostart.

; (3) Several important BASIC routines are vectored through RAM. Vectors
;     to all of these routines can be found in the indirect vector table.
;     The turbo loader changes those vectors to execute itself when the
;     CBM file is fully loaded (this is called "AUTOSTART").
