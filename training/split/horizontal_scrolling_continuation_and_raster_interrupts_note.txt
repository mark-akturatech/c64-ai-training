# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Notes on needing coarse scroll when fine-scroll bits wrap (0<->7) and the requirement of using raster interrupts to isolate portions of the screen to scroll independently, because changing bits affects the whole display.

                          As you can see, after the display has moved over seven dots, it starts
                          over at its original position.  In order to continue with the scroll,
                          you must do a coarse scroll every time the value of the scroll bits
                          goes from 7 to 0, or from 0 to 7.  This is accomplished by moving each
                          byte of display data on each line over one position, overwriting the
                          last character, and introducing a new byte of data on the opposite end
                          of the screen line to replace it.

                          Obviously, only a machine language program can move all of these bytes
                          quickly enough to maintain the effect of smooth motion.  The following
                          BASIC program, however, will give you an idea of what the combination
                          of fine and coarse scrolling looks like.

                              10 POKE 53281,0:PRINT CHR$(5);CHR$(147):FOR I=1 TO 5:PRINT CHR$(17):NEXT
                              20 FOR I=1 TO 30
                              30 PRINT TAB(I-1)"{UP}{10 SPACES}{UP}"
                              40 WAIT53265,128:POKE53270,PEEK(53270)AND248:PRINTTAB(I)"AWAY WE GO"
                              50 FOR J=1 TO 7
                              60 POKE 53270,(PEEK(53270)AND248)+J
                              70 FORK=1TO30-I
                              80 NEXT K,J,I:RUN

                          Changing the value of the three horizontal scroll bits will affect the
                          entire screen display.  If you wish to scroll only a portion of the
                          screen, you will have to use raster interrupts (see 53274 ($D01A)
                          below) to establish a scroll zone, change the value of these scroll
                          bits only when that zone is being displayed, and change it back to 0
                          afterward.
