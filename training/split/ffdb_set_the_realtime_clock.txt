# C64 KERNAL API (Lee Davison) - $FFDB — Set the real-time clock. System clock (jiffies, 1/60s increments) is three bytes (up to 5,184,000 jiffies). To set the clock put new time in Y,X,A with A = most significant byte then call this routine.

$FFDB          set the real time clock
               
               The system clock is maintained by an interrupt routine that updates the clock
               every 1/60th of a second. The clock is three bytes long which gives the capability
               to count from zero up to 5,184,000 jiffies - 24 hours plus one jiffy. At that point
               the clock resets to zero. Before calling this routine to set the clock the new time,
               in jiffies, should be in YXA, the accumulator containing the most significant byte.
