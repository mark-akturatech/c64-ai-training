# ca65 Users Guide - Structs, unions, enums open scopes if named; unnamed declarations add members to enclosing scope. Explicit scope specification uses namespace token '::' to access symbols in named scopes (example shows foo::bar and use of :: to access global scope).

7.5 Structs, unions and enums
Structs, unions and enums are explained in a separate section, I do only cover them here, because if they are declared with a name, they open a nested scope, similar to .SCOPE. However, when no name is specified, the behaviour is different: In this case, no new scope will be opened, symbols declared within a struct, union, or enum declaration will then be added to the enclosing scope instead.

7.6 Explicit scope specification
Accessing symbols from other scopes is possible by using an explicit scope specification, provided that the scope where the symbol lives in has a name. The namespace token (::) is used to access other scopes:


        .scope  foo
        bar:    .word   0
        .endscope

                ...
                lda     #foo::bar        ; Access bar in scope foo
The only way to deny access to a scope from the outside is to declare a scope without a name (using the .SCOPE command).

A special syntax is used to specify the global scope: If a symbol or scope is preceded by the namespace token, the global scope is searched:


        bar     = 3

        .scope  foo
                bar     = 2
                lda     #::bar  ; Access the global bar (which is 3)
        .endscope
