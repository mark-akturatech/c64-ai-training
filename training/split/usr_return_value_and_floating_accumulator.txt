# MACHINE - Explains that the BASIC USR() function returns the value in the floating accumulator; if unchanged it returns the argument (example: PRINT USR(5) returns 5).


When the USR function returns control to BASIC, the function value will be
whatever is in the floating accumulator.  If we have not modified it, this
will be the same as the argument, so that in many cases PRINT USR(5) would
print a value of 5.
