# byRiclianll - Program title and initial BASIC front-end: REM and DIM, user prompts and INPUT for the track and sector to destroy, parameter validation (track/sector range checks), calculation of NS (number of sectors per track depending on track), and a confirmation (are you sure?) prompt. This chunk prepares and validates the parameters before any drive access.
