# 6502 Multiplication and Division Algorithms - Source: llx.com - Strength reduction: eliminate multiplication by rewriting code (example: replacing repeated I*23 in a loop with repeated addition). Emphasizes minimizing work and preferring specialized code for multiply-by-constant cases.

The Easiest Way to Multiply
----------------------------------------


The easiest way to multiply on the 6502 is not to do it at all.


Actually, that statement isn't nearly as useless as it seems.
Sometimes the nature of the problem is such that with a little
rewriting, the multiplication can be eliminated entirely.  This happens
often in loops, if the loop index has to be multiplied by something.
As an example, consider the following BASIC-like code fragment:


FOR I = 5 TO 100 STEP 5
  J = I*23
  Do something with J
NEXT I


This can be rewritten like this:


J = 115: REM 115 = 5*23
FOR I = 5 TO 100 STEP 5
  Do something with J
  J = J+115
NEXT I


This kind of rewriting is called strength reduction.
Optimizing compilers will usually notice when this is possible, and
automatically rewrite the code to take advantage of it.


The problem with this, of course, is that many multiplications
can't be eliminated by rewriting.  For these cases, the rule
is, "Don't work any harder than you have to."  If all you need is to
multiply
by a constant, the code for that will usually be much more efficient
than a general routine to multiply any two arbitrary numbers.
