# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Specific references: 'Mapping the C-64' (memory map), 'Programmer's Reference Guide' (opcode table & cycles), 'All About Your C-64', and Christian Bauer's VIC-II article. FTP/Project links mentioned.

References

Mapping the C-64. This is a great memory map, with thorough explanations of all addresses in the C-64. It should be available at Project 64 (which also has some other useful documents): http://project64.c64.org/index.html.

Programmer's Reference Guide. This one has a nice table of opcodes, with cycle counts, addressing modes etc. Most of the book is pretty useless, though. This one should also be available at Project 64: http://project64.c64.org/index.html.

All About Your C-64. This is a document put together by Ninja/The Dreams, which can be really handy. Especially the HTML version is nice to have available when coding, and you can't remember quite which bit it was that you had to fiddle with to achieve something. This one's available from the The Dreams' home page at http://www.the-dreams.de/.

The MOS 6567/6569 Video Controller (VIC-II) and its Application in the C-64, by Christian Bauer. This article should contain everything that is known about the VIC. There is a text version available at (it's also available in HTML somewhere else): ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/cbm/documents/chipdata/VIC-Article.gz.
