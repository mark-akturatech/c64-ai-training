# ********* - Documents BITCI ($A8), the RS-232 input bit count (also used as cassette temporary storage). Used to count bits received so the serial routine knows when a full word has been received; also used as an error flag during tape loads.

RS-232 Input Bit Count/Cassete Temporary Storage

This location is used to count the number of bits of serial data that
has been received.  This is necessary so that the serial routines will
know when a full word has been received.  It is also used as an error
flag during tape loads.
