# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Wrapper at $FF8D that JMPs to $FD1A to read or set vectored I/O. Provides API entry for reading/writing the vector list stored at $0314.

                                *** read/set vectored I/O
                                this routine manages all system vector jump addresses stored in RAM. Calling this
                                routine with the carry bit set will store the current contents of the RAM vectors
                                in a list pointed to by the X and Y registers. When this routine is called with
                                the carry bit clear, the user list pointed to by the X and Y registers is copied
                                to the system RAM vectors.
                                NOTE: This routine requires caution in its use. The best way to use it is to first
                                read the entire vector contents into the user area, alter the desired vectors and
                                then copy the contents back to the system vectors.
