# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Filename-setting helper called by parameter parsers: evaluate an expression and a string to obtain the filename pointer, retrieve the string pointer from BASIC pointers ($22/$23) and call the KERNAL filename setter ($FFBD) to copy the filename into the KERNAL buffer. (Includes JSR $AD9E to evaluate expression, JSR $B6A3 to evaluate string, and JMP $FFBD to perform the actual filename copy.)
