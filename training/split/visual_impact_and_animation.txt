# Contents - Visual design advice: visual impact is critical; choose color combinations that display well on a TV (high contrast works best); vary animation sequences for moving figures to increase interest (explosions, fades, carrying animations), and use flashing colors or changed sprites to indicate state changes.

VISUAL IMPACT 

The visual impact of the game is the first thing 
anyone playing your game will notice. If the anima- 
tion is interesting, it will quickly attract attention. 
The proper use of color is important. When you are 
using a normal television as a monitor, certain col- 
ors interact with each other better than others. 
Black characters on a white background will give 
quite a bit of contrast. The characters will be very 
clear and sharp. On the other hand, red characters 
on a blue background will appear fuzzy and in- 
distinct. 

Varying the animation sequences that are used 
to make up a moving figure can add to the attrac- 
tion of the game, if they are changed at the ap- 
propriate time. A game in which a character 
explodes and fades out after it is shot will be a more 
interesting game than one in which the character 
simply disappears. Similarly, figures can be 
changed to indicate that something is being carried, 
or that the player is at a different level. At times, 
simply flashing the colors of a character will add 
to the visual effect of the game.
