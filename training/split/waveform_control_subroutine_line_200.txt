Shows POKES+4,129 to turn on the waveform control (enable sound) and POKES+4,128 to turn it off, and RETURN to go back to the caller (end of line 70) so execution resumes after changing waveform control bytes.

    POKES+4,129         Waveform control set to 129 turns on the sound
                        effect.
    POKES+4,128         Waveform control set to 128 turns off the sound
                        effect.
