# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $D010 (53264) MSIGX — Most Significant Bits of Sprites 0-7 Horizontal Position: bit0..bit7 correspond to sprites 0..7; setting bit adds 256 to sprite's horizontal position extending range to 511.

$D010        MSIGX        Most Significant Bits of Sprites 0-7 Horizontal Position

                     0    Most significant bit of Sprite 0 horizontal position
                     1    Most significant bit of Sprite 1 horizontal position
                     2    Most significant bit of Sprite 2 horizontal position
                     3    Most significant bit of Sprite 3 horizontal position
                     4    Most significant bit of Sprite 4 horizontal position
                     5    Most significant bit of Sprite 5 horizontal position
                     6    Most significant bit of Sprite 6 horizontal position
                     7    Most significant bit of Sprite 7 horizontal position

                          Setting one of these bites to 1 adds 256 to the horizontal position of
                          the corresponding sprite.  Resetting one of these bits to 0 restricts
                          the horizontal position of the corresponding sprite to a value of 255
                          or less
