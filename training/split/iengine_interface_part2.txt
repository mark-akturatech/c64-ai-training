# Kick Assembler - IEngine interface methods (part 2): error(String message, ISourceRange) with range, getCurrentDirectory(), getFile(String filename) (searches library dirs and returns null if not found), normalizeFileName(String name) to evaluate %o substitutions, openOutputStream(String name) to create outputs (throws Exception), print(String message), printNow(String message), stringToBytes(String str) converting to PETSCII upper case bytes.

Tells if you can get a string from the value.

boolean hasBooleanRepresentation();

Tells if you can get a boolean from the value.

boolean hasListRepresentation();

Tells if you can get a list from the value.

17.4.3. The ISourceRange Interface
The ISourceRange interface represents a position in the source code. An example could be line 17 column 3 to
line 17 column 10. These are given to plugins to indicate where it is called from or where certain parameters are
defined. The plugin can give them back when reporting errors to indicate what code coursed the error.
Seen from the plugin, the interface is empty:
public interface ISourceRange {
}

17.4.4. The IMemoryBlock Interface
The IMemoryBlock interface represents a memory block. A block consist of a start address and some byte data.
Here are an example of two memory blocks generated by the assembler:
*=$1000 "Block 1"
.byte 1,2,3
*=$2000 "Block 2"
lda #1
sta $d020
rts
