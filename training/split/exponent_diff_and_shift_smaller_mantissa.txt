# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Handle FAC2 < FAC1 (or swapped case): clear index and rounding byte for FAC1/FAC2 as needed, compare exponent difference with $F9 to ensure it's within range, copy exponent difference to Y, fetch rounding byte, perform an LSR on a mantissa byte, and call the shift routine (JSR) to shift the smaller mantissa right by Y to align mantissas.

                                FAC2 < FAC1
.,B893 A0 00    LDY #$00        clear Y
.,B895 84 70    STY $70         clear FAC1 rounding byte
.,B897 C9 F9    CMP #$F9        compare exponent diff with $F9
.,B899 30 C7    BMI $B862       branch if range $79-$F8
.,B89B A8       TAY             copy exponent difference to Y
.,B89C A5 70    LDA $70         get FAC1 rounding byte
.,B89E 56 01    LSR $01,X       shift FAC? mantissa 1
.,B8A0 20 B0 B9 JSR $B9B0       shift FACX Y times right
