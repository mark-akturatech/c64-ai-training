# ********* - VICSCN (locations 1024-2047 / $400-$7FF): default video screen memory area (25 lines x 40 columns video matrix and sprite data pointers). Describes that the VIC-II memory bank select and VIC-II control register (53272 $D018, CIA #2 $DD00) determine the current location; explains how screen RAM stores screen codes and how PRINT/POKE to this area will display characters, with caveat about color RAM needing to be set (color RAM at 55296 $D800). Includes examples showing POKE to display characters and outlines how to initialize color RAM by changing background color before clearing the screen.

Video Screen Memory Area

This is the default location of the video screen memory area, which
contains the video matrix and the sprite data pointers.  Keep in mind,
however, that the video screen memory area can be relocated to start
on any even 1K boundary.  Its location at any given moment is
getermined by the VIC-II chip memory control register at 53272
($D018), and the VIC-II memory bank select bits on CIA #2 Data Port A
(56576, $DD00).

Video Matrix: 25 Lines by 40 Columns

The video matrix is where thext screen characters are stored in RAM.
Normally, the VIC-II chip will treat each byte of memory here as a
screen display code and will display the text character that
corresponds to that byte of code.  The first byte of memory here will
be displayed in the top-left corner of the screen, and subsequent
bytes will be displayed in the columns to the right and the rows below
that character.

It is possible to make text or graphics characters appear on the
screen by POKEing their screen codes directly into this area of RAM.
For example, the letter A has a screen code value of 1.  Therefore,
POKE 1024,1 should make the letter A appear in the top-left corner of
the screen.

However, you should be aware that the most current version of the
Operating System initializes the color RAM which is used for the
foreground color of text characters to the same value as the
background color every time that the screen is cleared.  The result is
that although the POKE will put a blue A on the screen, you won't be
able to see it because it is the same color blue as the background.
This can be remedied by POKEing a different value into color RAM
(which starts at 55296 ($D800)).

A POKE 1024,1:POKE 1024+54272,1 will put a white A in the upper-left
corner of the screen.  The loop

FOR I=0 TO 255:POKE 1024+I,I:POKE 1024+54272+I,1:NEXT

will display all of the characters in white at the top of the screen.
Another solution to the color RAM problem is to fool the Operating
System into initializing the color RAM for you.  If you change the
background color to the desired foreground color before you clear the
screen, color RAM will be set to that color.  Then, all you have to do
is change the background color back to what it was.  This example will
show how it's done:

10 POKE 53281,2:REM BACKGROUND IS RED
20 PRINT CHR$(147):REM CLEAR SCREEN
30 POKE 53281,1:REM BACKGROUND IS WHITE
40 POKE 1024,1:REM RED "A" APPEARS IN TOP LEFT CORNER
