# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Cartridge recommendation: Action Replay (esp. v6) or Final Cartridge. Important features: fast loader and monitor for development, memory movement and debugging.

Tools
In this section, which maybe should have been called an appendix, I'll go through some tools you'll need to use when putting together demos. There are lots of free tools available on the FTP sites and the web, and if you don't have Internet access, you can get them from your contacts. If you don't have any contacts either, send me a couple of floppies and you'll get them back, filled with nice tools. My address is at the end of this document.


Cartridges
You need one of these. Without a good cartridge, your life is going to be a lot harder. The most popular carts are the Action Replay series, in particular version VI. Those can be a bit hard to come by, though, so you might have to stick to a Final Cartridge, or some other cart. The most important features are a fast loader an a monitor. If you have those, the cart is pretty okay. You need the monitor to move things around in memory, debug code etc. And well, you really can't live without a fastloader...
