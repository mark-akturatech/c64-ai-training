# SID 6581/8580 Sound Interface Device - Programming Guide - Ring modulation replaces a voice's triangle output with product of that triangle and the modulating voice oscillator, creating sum/difference frequencies (non-harmonic metallic timbres). Pairings: Voice1 mod by Voice3 (bit2 $D404), Voice2 by Voice1 (bit2 $D40B), Voice3 by Voice2 (bit2 $D412). Triangle bit must be set on modulated voice; modulator must run but needn't be gated.

9. RING MODULATION
================================================================================

Ring modulation replaces the triangle waveform output of one voice with the
product of that voice's triangle waveform and the oscillator of the modulating
voice. This produces sum and difference frequencies, creating non-harmonic,
bell-like, or metallic timbres.

Voice pairing (same as sync):
  Voice 1 ring-modulated by Voice 3 (bit 2 of $D404)
  Voice 2 ring-modulated by Voice 1 (bit 2 of $D40B)
  Voice 3 ring-modulated by Voice 2 (bit 2 of $D412)

Requirements:
  - The TRIANGLE waveform bit must be set on the ring-modulated voice
  - The modulating voice's oscillator must be running (frequency > 0)
  - The modulating voice does not need to be gated or audible

The output frequencies are: F1+F2 and F1-F2 (and their harmonics), where
F1 is the voice's own frequency and F2 is the modulating voice's frequency.

When F1 and F2 are harmonically related (e.g., octaves), the result sounds
tonal. When they are not harmonically related, the result sounds metallic
or bell-like.

Example - Bell/Chime Sound:
  Set Voice 1 frequency high ($0082 high byte ~ 130)
  Set Voice 3 frequency to a non-harmonic ratio ($001E high byte ~ 30)
  Enable RING MOD on Voice 1 (bit 2 of $D404)
  Set Triangle waveform on Voice 1 (bit 4 of $D404)
  Use short attack, medium decay for percussive bell envelope
