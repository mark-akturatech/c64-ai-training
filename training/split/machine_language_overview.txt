# Contents - Machine language (native opcodes) is fastest because instructions execute directly; drawback is unreadable hexadecimal codes. Discusses execution determinism and contrast with BASIC; motivation to use an assembler.

Machine language, on the other hand, is the 
most efficient form that a program may take. Each 
instruction in the program is executed exactly as it 
is entered. There is no interpretation done on the 
code, so it runs at the highest possible speed. You 
also know the status of the entire computer at every 
step — which rarely happens in a BASIC program. 

The major drawback to programming in 
machine language is that it is a collection of hex- 
adecimal codes. This is fine for the computer, 
because the binary data that these codes represent 
can be immediately executed, but it is cumbersome 
for the programmer. Most programmers do not en-

joy memorizing all of the hex codes, and even fewer 
enjoy reading such a program when it is finished.
