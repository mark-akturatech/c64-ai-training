Lists common BASIC error messages (TOO MANY FILES, FILE OPEN, SYNTAX, NEXT WITHOUT FOR, etc.) and references miscellaneous messages (cursor/READY/BREAK).

ASCII Text of BASIC Error Messages

This table contains the ASCII text of all of the BASIC error messages.
As in the keyword table, Bit 7 of the last letter of each message is
set to indicate the end of the message.  Although we've all seen some
of them at one time or another, it's somewhat daunting to see the
whole list at once.  The possible errors you can make include:

 1.  TOO MANY FILES
 2.  FILE OPEN
 3.  FILE NOT OPEN
 4.  FILE NOT FOUND
 5.  DEVICE NOT PRESENT
 6.  NOT INPUT FILE
 7.  NOT OUTPUT FILE
 8.  MISSING FILENAME
 9.  ILLEGAL DEVICE NUMBER
10.  NEXT WITHOUT FOR
11.  SYNTAX
12.  RETURN WITHOUT GOSUB
13.  OUT OF DATA
14.  ILLEGAL QUANTITY
15.  OVERFLOW
16.  OUT OF MEMORY
17.  UNDEF'D STATEMENT
18.  BAD SUBSCRIPT
19.  REDIM'D ARRAY
20.  DIVISION BY ZERO
21.  ILLEGAL DIRECT
22.  TYPE MISMATCH
23.  STRING TOO LONG
24.  FILE DATA
25.  FORMULA TOO COMPLEX
26.  CAN'T CONTINUE
27.  UNDEF'D FUNCTION
28.  VERIFY
29.  LOAD

Message number 30, BREAK, is located in the Miscellaneous Messages
table below.
