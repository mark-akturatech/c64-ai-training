# COMMODORE 64 - Explains LINE 85: P=P+1 increments the sprite pointer so the sprite cycles through multiple shapes. Describes the wrap test (IF P>194 THEN P=192) that keeps P cycling through 192, 193, 194 (three 64-byte sprite shape blocks located at the specified memory ranges). Explains how this makes the pointer point consecutively to three shape blocks for animation.




  LINE 85:

    P=P+1               Now we increase the value of the pointer by adding
                        1 to the original value of P.

    IFP>194THEN         We only want to point the sprite to 3 memory lo-
    P=192               cations. 192 points to locations 12288 to 12350,
                        193 points to locations 12352 to 12414, and 194
                        points to locations 12416 to 12478. This line tells
                        the computer to reset P back to 192 as soon as P
                        becomes 195 so P never really becomes 195. P is
                        192, 193, 194 and then resets back to 192 and the
                        pointer winds up pointing consecutively to the
                        three sprite shapes in the three 64-byte groups of
                        memory locations containing the DATA.
