# ********* - RAMTAS routine (RAM Test and Set Pointers): clears zero page and pages 2 and 3, sets tape buffer pointer to $33C, performs nondestructive RAM test from $0400 upwards to determine top of RAM (stores in top-of-RAM pointer), sets bottom-of-RAM pointer to $0800 (start of BASIC program text), and sets the screen memory pointer used by the OS.

Perform RAM Test and Set Pointers to the Top and Bottom of RAM

This documented Kernal routine, which can be entered through location
65415 ($FF87) of the jump table, performs a number of initialization
tasks.

First, it clears Pages 0, 2, and 3 of memory to zeros.  Next, it sets
the tape buffer pointer to address 828 ($33C), and performs a
nondestructive test of RAM from 1024 ($400) up.  When it reaches a
non-RAM address (presumably the BASIC ROM at 40960 ($A000)), that
address is placed in the top of memory pointer at 643-4 ($283-4).  The
bottom of memory pointer at 641-2 ($281-2) is set to point to address
2048 ($800), which is the beginning of BASIC program text.  Finally,
the pointer to screen memory at 648 ($288) is set to 4, which lets the
Operating System know that screen memory starts at 1024 ($400).
