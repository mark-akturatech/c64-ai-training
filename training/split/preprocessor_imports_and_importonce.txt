# Kick Assembler - Section 8.3: #import and #importif usage for including other source files, examples, and #importonce usage to ensure a file is only imported once (pattern for library files).

8.3. Importing files
To include another sourcefile in your code, use the #import directive. You can also make a conditional import
with the #importif directive.
#import "MyLibrary.asm"
#importif STAND_ALONE "UpstartCode.asm" //<- Only imported if STAND_ALONE is
defined

To ensure that a file (e.g. a library) is only imported once, place an #importonce inside the imported file
File1.asm:
#importonce
.print "This will only be printed once!"
File2.asm:
#import "File1.asm" // This will import File1
#import "File1.asm" // This will not import anything
