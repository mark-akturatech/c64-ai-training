# byRiclianll - Describes the contents summary in the example: the demo disk has 15 active files (all PRG), and the final directory line shows remaining available blocks. Explains the arithmetic used to obtain '558 BLOCKS FREE' as the formatted capacity (664 blocks) minus the sum of blocks used by active files (664 - 106 = 558).

Your  demo  diskette  came  with  15  active  files  on  it.  Moreover,  they  are  all  program  files 
denoted  by  PRG.  The  last  entry  in  the  directory  is  the  remaining  number  of  available 
blocks/sectors  left  on  the  diskette  for  storage.  It  is  the  difference  between  664  blocks 
available  at  the  time  of  original  formatting  and  the  sum  of  the  blocks  of  the  active  files 
(664  -  106  =  558).
