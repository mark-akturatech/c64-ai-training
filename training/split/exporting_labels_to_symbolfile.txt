# Kick Assembler - Explains exporting assembled symbols to a .sym file using –symbolfile option (java –jar KickAss.jar source1.asm –symbolfile) producing source1.sym with namespace and label declarations (e.g. .namespace source1 { .label clearColor = $2000 }). Shows importing the .sym file to refer to labels from another file via .import source "source1.sym" and using jsr source1.clearColor.

14.2. Basic Upstart Program
To make the assembled machine code run on a C64 or in an emulator, it's useful to include a little basic program
that starts your code (for example: 10 sys 4096). The BasicUpstart macro is standard macro that helps you to create
programs like that. The following program shows how it’s used:
*= $0801 "Basic Upstart"
BasicUpstart(start)
// 10 sys$0810

start:

*= $0810 "Program"
inc $d020
inc $d021
jmp start

TIP: Insert at basic upstart program in the start of your programs and use the –execute option to start Vice. This
will automatically load and execute your program in Vice after successful assembling.
There is a second variation of the basic upstart macro that also takes care of setting up memory blocks:
BasicUpstart2(start)
start: inc $d020
inc $d021
jmp start

// 10 sys$0810

If you want to see the script code for the macros, you can look in the autoinclude.asm file in the KickAss.jar file.
