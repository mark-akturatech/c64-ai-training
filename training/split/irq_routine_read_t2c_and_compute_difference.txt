# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Start of the IRQ-driven tape read routine: read VIA1 timer B high/low (DC07/DC06), compute the elapsed count as ($FF - T2C_l) and ensure no rollover by comparing high bytes, save timer bytes ($DC04/$DC05) and copy timing constants into $B1/$B0 as preparation for pulse classification.

                                read tape bits, IRQ routine
                                read T2C which has been counting down from $FFFF. subtract this from $FFFF
.,F92C AE 07 DC LDX $DC07       read VIA 1 timer B high byte
.,F92F A0 FF    LDY #$FF        set $FF
.,F931 98       TYA             A = $FF
.,F932 ED 06 DC SBC $DC06       subtract VIA 1 timer B low byte
.,F935 EC 07 DC CPX $DC07       compare it with VIA 1 timer B high byte
.,F938 D0 F2    BNE $F92C       if timer low byte rolled over loop
.,F93A 86 B1    STX $B1         save tape timing constant max byte
.,F93C AA       TAX             copy $FF - T2C_l
.,F93D 8C 06 DC STY $DC06       save VIA 1 timer B low byte
.,F940 8C 07 DC STY $DC07       save VIA 1 timer B high byte
