# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Overview of the Commodore cassette data stream symbols and how the ROM loader decodes them. Defines the A (break/very long), B (short), C (medium), and D (long) pulse types with typical cycle times, and explains the IRQ-driven decoding strategy: a timer is started and an IRQ occurs either when the tape signal changes or the timer runs out; comparing which happened determines a '0' (short) or '1' (long).

                                *** On Commodore computers, the streams consist of four kinds of symbols
                                that denote different kinds of low-to-high-to-low transitions on the
                                read or write signals of the Commodore cassette interface.
                                
                                A A break in the communications, or a pulse with very long cycle
                                  time.
                                
                                B A short pulse, whose cycle time typically ranges from 296 to 424
                                  microseconds, depending on the computer model.
                                
                                C A medium-length pulse, whose cycle time typically ranges from
                                  440 to 576 microseconds, depending on the computer model.
                                
                                D A long pulse, whose cycle time typically ranges from 600 to 744
                                  microseconds, depending on the computer model.
                                
                                 The actual interpretation of the serial data takes a little more work to explain.
                                The typical ROM tape loader (and the turbo loaders) will initialize a timer with a
                                specified value and start it counting down. If either the tape data changes or the
                                timer runs out, an IRQ will occur. The loader will determine which condition caused
                                the IRQ. If the tape data changed before the timer ran out, we have a short pulse,
                                or a "0" bit. If the timer ran out first, we have a long pulse, or a "1" bit. Doing
                                this continuously and we decode the entire file.
