# 6502 Multiplication and Division Algorithms - Source: llx.com - Setup routine to initialize four page-zero pointers to the two precomputed square tables (sum and diff tables): LDA #SSQLO/256 STA PSLO+1; LDA #SSQHI/256 STA PSHI+1; LDA #DSQLO/256 STA PDLO+1; LDA #DSQHI/256 STA PDHI+1. Explains tables must be page-aligned for the subsequent indexed indirect (PSLO),Y lookups.

A brief setup routine is needed to set up four pointers in page 0:


LDA #SSQLO/256
        STA PSLO+1
        LDA #SSQHI/256
        STA PSHI+1
        LDA #DSQLO/256
        STA PDLO+1
        LDA #DSQHI/256
        STA PDHI+1
