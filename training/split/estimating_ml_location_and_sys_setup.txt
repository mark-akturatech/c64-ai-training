# MACHINE - Guidance for estimating the BASIC program size and choosing a safe start address for machine language. Concludes that ML can be placed at $0880 (decimal 2176) and instructs changing the BASIC SYS line to SYS 2176 while advising not to run the program yet.

                                                                        :106:

It seems likely that our BASIC program will occupy less than 127 bytes.  We
may check this later, but it seems safe to plan to start our machine language
program around 2049+127, or 2176 (hexadecimal 880).  On that basis, we may
change line 130 to SYS 2176.  Do not try to run the program yet.
