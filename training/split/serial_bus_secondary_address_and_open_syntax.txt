# COMMODORE 64 - Explanation of the SECONDARY ADDRESS concept on the serial bus for transmitting setup information to a device. Includes example OPEN 1,4,7 and explains the meaning of the three fields: logical file number (1), device address (4), and secondary address (7) to set device mode (e.g., printer upper/lower case).

    Other device addresses are possible. Each device has its own address.
  Certain devices (like the Commodore 64 printer) provide a choice between
  two addresses for the convenience of the user.
    The SECONDARY ADDRESS is to let the Commodore 64 transmit setup
  information to a device. For example, to OPEN a connection on the bus to
  the printer, and have it print in UPPER/LOWER case, use the following

    OPEN 1,4,7

  where,
    1 is the logical file number (the number you PRINT# to),
    4 is the ADDRESS of the printer, and
    7 is the SECONDARY ADDRESS that tells the printer to go into UPPER/
      LOWER case mode.
