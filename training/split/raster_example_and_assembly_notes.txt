# Contents - Reference to example code: Listing C-3 demonstrates using a RAST (raster) interrupt to change the screen background color mid-screen. Notes on assembler usage, inclusion of the macro library and system definitions via .LIB, and that Listing C-4 shows the executable.

Listing C-3 in Appendix C is the source code 
for a program that uses a RASTER interrupt to 
change the background color of the screen in the 
middle of the screen. This is also a good time to en- 
sure that you are using your assembler properly. If 
you can successfully enter and run this short pro- 
gram, you should have no problem getting some of 
the longer programs to run later. The macro library 
and the system definitions that were defined earlier 
(Listings C-l and C-2) are inserted into the program 
by the .LIB directive of the assembler. An ex- 
ecutable version of this program is shown in Listing 
C-4.
