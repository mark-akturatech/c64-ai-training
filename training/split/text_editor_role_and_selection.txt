# Contents - Describes the text editor's role as the primary interface for entering and modifying source code, notes that some assemblers permit external word processors, and advises trying editors before buying because limited editors waste programming time.

The text editor is the part of the assembler that 
you will spend the most time with. It allows you to 
enter, modify, and update your program. Some 
assemblers allow you to use a word processor to 
enter your program. Whatever method you choose, 
make sure that you are comfortable with the editing 
commands that are available on your text editor. 

It is a good idea to try out an editor before buy- 
ing it. Some assemblers come with editors that are 
very limiting in what they allow you to do. Limita- 
tions in the editor take from your programming 
time, so it pays to shop around for a good one.
