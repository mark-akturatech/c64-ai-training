# MACHINE - How to test the wedge: write a small BASIC program with an '&' command, run it and get SYNTAX ERROR, then run SYS 862 to enable wedge. When re-run, '&' prints ten asterisks. Notes caution that infiltrating BASIC is tricky.

When you have completed and checked the code (remember this is for VIC and
Commodore 64 only), return to BASIC.  Type NEW and write the following
program:

  100 PRINT 34:&:PRINT 5+6
  110 &
  120 PRINT "THAT'S ALL"

If you type RUN, you will get a SYNTAX ERROR in line 100.  We have not yet
implemented our "ampersand" command.  Type the command SYS 862.  Now type RUN
again.  The ampersand command obediently prints ten asterisks each time it is
invoked.

Infiltrating BASIC isn't an easy job.  But it can be done.
