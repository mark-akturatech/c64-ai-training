# ca65 Users Guide - Documentation for the .RIGHT builtin function: extracts the rightmost part of a token list. Syntax: .RIGHT (<int expr>, <token list>) where the first argument is the number of tokens to extract and the second is the token list (optionally enclosed in curly braces to include terminator-like tokens). References .LEFT and .MID as complementary functions.

Builtin function. Extracts the right part of a given token list.

Syntax:


        .RIGHT (<int expr>, <token list>)
  
The first integer expression gives the number of tokens to extract from the token list. The second argument is the token list itself. The token list may optionally be enclosed into curly braces. This allows the inclusion of tokens that would otherwise terminate the list (the closing right paren in the given case).

See also the .LEFT and .MID builtin functions.
