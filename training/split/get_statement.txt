# COMMODORE 64 - GET <variable list>: reads single keystrokes from keyboard buffer (up to 10 in buffer). Behavior: reading numeric variable with non-digit causes ?SYNTAX ERROR; recommended to read as strings and convert later. Example usage including looping until a key is hit.

  GET

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: GET <variable list>

    Action: This statement reads each key typed by the user. As the user is
  typing, the characters are stored in the Commodore 64's keyboard buffer.
  Up to 10 characters are stored here, and any keys struck after the 10th
  are lost. Reading one of the characters with the GET statement makes room
  for another character.
    If the GET statement specifies numeric data, and the user types a key
  other than a number, the message ?SYNTAX ERROR appears. To be safe, read
  the keys as strings and convert them to numbers later.

    The GET statement can be used to avoid some of the limitations of the
  INPUT statement. For more on this, see the section on Using the GET
  Statement in the Programming Techniques section.


  EXAMPLES of GET Statement:

    10 GET A$: IF A$ ="" THEN 10: REM LOOPS IN 10 UNTIL ANY KEY HIT
    20 GET A$, B$, C$, D$, E$: REM READS 5 KEYS
    30 GET A, A$
