# 6502 Instruction Set - Additional W65C02 NOP opcodes (various sizes/cycles) listed numerically and by opcode values. Modified cycle times and penalties: BCD arithmetic cycle penalty for ADC/SBC (extra cycle in decimal mode), read-modify-write behaviors changed (no initial writeback; dummy read instead) and absolute-indexed RMW instructions may be faster if no page crossing. Indirect JMP page-boundary behavior fixed but adds cycle on boundary. Behavioral changes summary: decimal flag cleared on reset/interrupt, no undefined opcodes (reserved opcodes execute as NOPs), correct N/V/Z flags for decimal math, indexed addressing page behavior changes, read-modify-write timing changes, BRK timing changes, and RDY pin bidirectional WAI behavior.

                 BBS  Branch on Bit Set***
                      Similar to BBR, but branches on bit n set.
                      Individual mnemonics designate the tested bit,
                      as in BBSn, where n = 0..7.
                      As with all branch instructions, the address
                      mode is relative, taking a signed single-byte
                      offset as operand.

                      branches unconditionally.
                      Equivalent to a relative jump.

                 RMB  Reset Memory Bit ***
                      Resets a bit in memory at the given zeropage
                      location. This is an entire family of eight
                      instructions in total, resetting one of bits #0
                      to #7, each. Individual mnemonics designate the
                      bit to be reset, as in RMBn, where n = 0..7.
                      The operand is always a zeropage address.
