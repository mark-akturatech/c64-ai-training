# MACHINE - Defines the bus concept (groups of wires used together), lists 650x family chips (6502, 6510, 6509, 7501), and explains the address bus: 16 address lines sent by the CPU to select a memory/device chip; how a single chip is selected among many. Includes Figure 1.1 (address bus illustration) and remarks about address decoding.


The Bus
-------

It's fairly common for a group of circuits to be used together.  The wires
run from one microchip to another, and then on to the next.  Where a group of
wires are used together and connect to several different points, the group is
called a bus (sometimes spelled "buss").  [um, isn't a "buss" another word
for a "kiss"?  better check what's going on inside my machine... HEY! -wf]

The PET, CBM, and VIC-20 use a microprocessor chip called the 6502.  The
Commodore 64 uses a 6510.  The Commodore B series uses a 6509 chip, and the
Commodore PLUS/4 uses a chip called the 7501.  All these chips are similar,
and there are other chips in the same family with numbers like 6504; every
one works on the same principles, and we'll refer to all of them by the
family name 650x.

Let's take an example of a bus used on any 650x chip.  A 650x chip has little
built-in storage.  To get an instruction or perform a computation, the 650x
must call up information from "memory"--data stored within other chips.

The 650x sends out a "call" to all memory chips, asking for information.  It
does this by sending out voltages on a group of sixteen wires called the
"address bus."  Each of the sixteen wires may carry either voltage or no
voltage; this combination of signals is called an address.

Every memory chip is connected to the address bus.  Each chip reads the
address, the combination of voltages sent by the processor.  One and only one
chip says, "That's me!"  In other words, the specific address causes that
chip to be selected; it prepares to communicate with the 650x.  All other
chips say, "That's not me!" and will not participate in data transfer.
