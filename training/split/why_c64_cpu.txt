# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - C-64 CPU details: 6510 (6502 variant), simple instruction set, three main registers (A, X, Y), memory-mapped I/O; benefits and constraints for demo coding.

Why C-64
The second question I posed above was why you'd want to program your demos on a C-64. There are numerous very good reasons why you should use a C-64, some of which are applicable to some other hardware platforms as well, and some which aren't. I'll list some of my favourite reasons here.


The CPU
The CPU in the C-64 is a 6510, which is a variant of the 6502. It's a very nice processor to program. It has a simple instruction set, so it's easy to get started. It has been studied a lot and there's lots of documentation available. It uses memory mapped I/O, which means that performing I/O (like showing stuff on the screen) is no different than putting a value at some arbitrary memory location.

Of course, the 6502 only has three registers (not counting the PC, SP and Status register), which can make it a pain in the ass to implement complicated algorithms on, but on the other hand, it sure makes you appreciate a modern RISC processor with dozens of general-purpose registers.
