# COMMODORE 64 - STOP: halts program execution and returns to direct mode showing ?BREAK IN LINE nnnnn where nnnnn is line number of STOP. Variables and open files preserved. Program can be restarted via CONT or GOTO. Example showing STOP used conditionally.

  STOP

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: STOP

    Action: The STOP statement is used to halt execution of the current
  program and return to direct mode. Typing the <RUN/STOP> key on the
  keyboard has the same effect as a STOP statement. The BASIC error message
  ?BREAK IN LINE nnnnn is displayed on the screen, followed by READY. The
  "nnnnn" is the line-number where the STOP occurs. Any open files remain
  open and all variables are preserved and can be examined. The program can
  be restarted by using CONT or GOTO statements.

  EXAMPLES of STOP Statement:

    10 INPUT#1,AA,BB,CC
    20 IF AA=BB AND BB=CC THEN STOP
    30 STOP
                    (If the variable AA is -1 and BB is equal to CC then:)
  BREAK IN LINE 20
  BREAK IN LINE 30        (For any other data values)
