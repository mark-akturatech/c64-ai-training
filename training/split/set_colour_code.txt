# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - Compares the ASCII code in accumulator (A) against the 16-entry Commodore ASCII colour code table. If a match is found, stores the table offset (colour value) into COLOR at $0286. Iterates over 16 table entries.

                                *** SET COLOUR CODE
                                This routine is called by the output to screen routine.
                                The Commodore ASCII code in (A) is compared with the ASCII
                                colour code table. If a match is found, then the table
                                offset (and hence the colour value) is stored in COLOR.
