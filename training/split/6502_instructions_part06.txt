# 6502 Instructions by Type - Conditional Branches, Jumps, Subroutines

           Mnemonic Examples:
           LDA #$07 .... load the literal hexidecimal value "$7" into the accumulator
           ADC #$A0 .... add the literal hexidecimal value "$A0" to the accumulator
           CPX #$32 .... compare the X-register to the literal hexidecimal value "$32"
           Absolute Addressing
           Absolute addressing modes provides the 16-bit address of a memory
           location, the contents of which used as the operand to the
           instruction. In machine language, the address is provided in two
           bytes immediately after the instruction (making these 3-byte
           instructions) in low-byte, high-byte order (LLHH) or little-endian.
           In assembler, conventional numbers (HHLL order or big-endian words)
           are used to provide the address.
           Absolute addresses are also used for the jump instructions JMP and
           JSR to provide the address for the next instruction to continue with
           in the control flow.
                                                                    6502 Instruction Set
            Mnemonic      Instruction          Data
            LDA $3010      AD 10 30     $3010: 34
                                            A: 34
           Mnemonic Examples:
           LDA $3010 ... load the contents of address "$3010" into the accumulator
           ROL $08A0 ... rotate the contents of address "$08A0" left by one position
           JMP $4000 ... jump to (continue with) location "$4000"
           Zero-Page Addressing
           The 16-bit address space available to the 6502 is thought to consist
           of 256 "pages" of 256 memory locations each ($00…$FF). In this model
           the high-byte of an address gives the page number and the low-byte a
           location inside this page. The very first of these pages, where the
           high-byte is zero (addresses $0000…$00FF), is somewhat special.
           The zero-page address mode is similar to absolute address mode, but
           these instructions use only a single byte for the operand, the low-
           byte, while the high-byte is assumed to be zero by definition.
           Therefore, these instructions have a total length of just two bytes
           (one less than absolute mode) and take one CPU cycle less to
           execute, as there is one byte less to fetch.
            Mnemonic    Instruction            Data
            LDA $80        A5 80        $0080: 34
                                            A: 34
           Mnemonic Examples:
           LDA $80 ..... load the contents of address "$0080" into the accumulator
           BIT $A2 ..... perform bit-test with the contents of address "$00A2"
           ASL $9A ..... arithmetic shift left of the contents of location "$009A"
           (One way to think of the zero-page is as a page of 256 additional
           registers, somewhat slower than the internal registers, but with
           zero-page instructions also faster executing than "normal"
           instructions. The zero-page has a few more tricks up its sleeve,
           making these addresses perform more like real registers, see below.)
           Indexed Addressing: Absolute,X and Absolute,Y
           Indexed addressing adds the contents of either the X-register or the
           Y-register to the provided address to give the effective address,
           which provides the operand.
                                                               6502 Instruction Set
           These instructions are usefull to e.g., load values from tables or
           to write to a continuous segment of memory in a loop. The most basic
           forms are "absolute,X" and "absolute,X", where either the X- or the
           Y-register, respectively, is added to a given base address. As the
           base address is a 16-bit value, these are generally 3-byte
           instructions. Since there is an additional operation to perform to
           determine the effective address, these instructions are one cycle
           slower than those using absolute addressing mode.*
            Mnemonic      Instruction            Data
            LDA $3120,X    BD 20 31
                                     + = $3132: 78
                              X: 12
                                              A: 78
           Mnemonic Examples:
           LDA $3120,X ... load the contents of address "$3120 + X" into A
           LDX $8240,Y ... load the contents of address "$8240 + Y" into X
           INC $1400,X ... increment the contents of address "$1400 + X"
           *) If the addition of the contents of the index register effects in
           a change of the high-byte given by the base address so that the
           effective address is on the next memory page, the additional
           operation to increment the high-byte takes another CPU cycle. This
           is also known as a crossing of page boundaries.
           Indexed Addressing: Zero-Page,X (and Zero-Page,Y)
           As with absolute addressing, there is also a zero-page mode for
           indexed addressing. However, this is generally only available with
           the X-register. (The only exception to this is LDX, which has an
           indexed zero-page mode utilizing the Y-register.)
           As we have already seen with normal zero-page mode, these
           instructions are one byte less in total length (two bytes) and take
           one CPU cycle less than instructions in absolute indexed mode.
           Unlike absolute indexed instructions with 16-bit base addresses,
           zero-page indexed instructions never affect the high-byte of the
           effective address, which will simply wrap around in the zero-page,
           and there is no penalty for crossing any page boundaries.
