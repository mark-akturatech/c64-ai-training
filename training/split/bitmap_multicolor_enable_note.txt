# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Note that multicolor bitmap mode is available: set multicolor bit (Bit 4 of $D016 / 53270) while in bitmap mode to produce 4-color per 8x8 area (reduces horizontal res to 160).

                          There is a slightly lower resolution bitmap graphics mode available
                          which offers up to four colors per 8 by 8 dot matrix.  To enable this
                          mode, you must set the multicolor bit (Bit 4 of 53270 ($D016)) while
                          in bitmap graphics mode.  For more information on this mode, see the
                          entry for the multicolor enable bit.
