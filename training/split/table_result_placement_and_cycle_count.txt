# 6502 Multiplication and Division Algorithms - Source: llx.com - Explains the routine result placement: product high byte in accumulator (A), product low byte in X. Notes worst-case timing: 38 cycles (when all indexing crosses a page boundary).


This leaves the product in the accumulator (high byte) and the X
register (low byte).  Worst-case time (all indexing crosses a page
boundary): 38 cycles.
