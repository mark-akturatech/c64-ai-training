# 6502 ADDRESSING MODES - Indirect Absolute addressing (format (aaaa)): used only by JMP on the 6502. The operand is a 2-byte address in memory which contains the low byte of the target address; the high byte is in the next memory location. Example: if $3418 contains $55 and $3419 contains $29, then JMP ($3418) transfers to $2955.

Indirect Absolute	(aaaa)

Only one 6502 instruction uses the indirect addressing mode in its simplest form.  The JMP instruction.  The operand is a 2 byte address, which contains the least significant byte of the target address.  The most significant byte of the target address is in the memory location following .  Transfer is controlled to the instruction in the location referred to by the target address.

If memory location 	$3418 		contains	$55
			$3419		contains	$29

JMP	($3418)		Will cause the processor to jump to the instruction in location $2955.
