# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Multicolor text mode: enabled by bit 4 of $D016 (53270). In this mode each byte is interpreted as four 2-bit pairs (bit-pairs), each pair selects one of four color sources: Background Color Register #0 (00), Background Color Register #1 (01), Background Color Register #2 (10), or the Color RAM nybble (11). Characters become 4 pixels wide (each pixel double-width) giving multicolor capability but lower horizontal resolution; user-defined characters often required for best results.

                          One graphics mode, multicolor text mode, almost requires that you
                          define your own character set in order to use it effectively.
                          Multicolor mode is enabled by Bit 4 of location 53270 ($D016).
                          Instead of using each bit to control whether an individual dot will be
                          foreground color (1) or background color (0), that mode breaks down
                          each byte of shape data in four bit-pairs.  These bit pairs control
                          whether a dot will be the color in Background Color Register #0 (00),
                          the color in Background Color Register #1 (01), the color in
                          Background Color Register #2 (10), or the color in the appropriate
                          nybble of Color RAM (11).  Since each pair of bits controls one dot,
                          each character is only four dots across.  To make up for this, each
                          dot is twice as wide as a normal high-resolution dot.
