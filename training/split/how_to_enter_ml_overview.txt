# COMMODORE 64 - Three common methods to add machine language programs to BASIC: 1) DATA statements (READ/POKE), 2) Machine language monitor (e.g., 64MON) entry and save, 3) Editor/assembler package. Pros/cons of each discussed.

  HOW TO ENTER MACHINE LANGUAGE

    There are 3 common methods to add the machine language programs to a
  BASIC program. They are:

  1) DATA STATEMENTS:

    By READing DATA statements, and POKEing the values into memory at the
  start of the program, machine language routines can be added. This is the
  easiest method. No special methods are needed to save the two parts of
  the program, and it is fairly easy to debug. The drawbacks include taking
  up more memory space, and the wait while the program is POKED in.
  Therefore, this method is better for smaller routines.
