# COMMODORE 64 - Synchronization and ring modulation overview: explains syncing of two oscillators (logical AND-like behavior) to lock waveforms (used to create 'mosquito' imitation). Ring modulation replaces output of oscillator 1 with a modulated combination of oscillator 1 and 3 to create non-harmonic overtones for sounds like bells/gongs. Shows which bits in register 4 control sync and ring-mod (bit 1 enables sync between voice 1 and 3; bit 3 enables ring modulation).

  SYNCHRONIZATION AND RING MODULATION

    The 6581 SID chip lets you create more complex harmonic structures
  through synchronization or ring modulation of two voices.
    The process of synchronization is basically a logical ANDing of two
  wave forms. When either is zero, the output is zero. The following
  example uses this process to create an imitation of a mosquito:

  EXAMPLE PROGRAM 9:

start tok64 page207.prg
  10 s=54272
  20 forl=0to24:pokes+l,0:next
  30 pokes+1,100
  40 pokes+5,219
  50 pokes+15,28
  60 pokes+24,15
  70 pokes+4,19
  80 fort=1to5000:next
  90 pokes+4,18
  100 fort=1to1000:next:pokes+24,0
stop tok64
