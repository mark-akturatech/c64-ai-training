# ********* - Prompt for track and sector, validate input, and issue disk commands to load specified block into the disk buffer. Includes INPUT for t,s, validation of track range (0 or >35 aborts), optional echo to screen/printer, and the CBM commands sent to the drive via channel 15: the 'U1' (u1:2,d$,t,s) command to position and read the addressed sector into the drive buffer, followed by an error-checking Gosub 650.
