# COMMODORE 64 - Explains LINE 35 showing how to set sprite 0's color and vertical position via VIC register pokes: POKE V+39,15 sets sprite 0 color to light grey, and POKE V+1,68 sets the sprite's Y coordinate (upper-right corner of the sprite square) to 68. Notes screen coordinate reference (position 50 is the top-left Y).


  LINE 35:

    POKEV+39,15         Sets color for sprite 0 to light grey.

    POKEV+1,68          Sets the upper right hand corner of the sprite
                        square to vertical (Y) position 68. For the sake of
                        comparison, position 50 is the top lefthand corner
                        Y position on the viewing screen.
