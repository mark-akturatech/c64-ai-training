# ********* - CRUNCH: tokenizes a program line stored in the BASIC input buffer at $200. Scans the line and replaces keywords and valid abbreviations (outside quotes) with their one-byte token equivalents. This routine is vectored through RAM at $304 so new commands can be added by diverting the vector.

Tokenize Line in Input Buffer

When a line of program text has been input into the BASIC text buffer
at 512 ($200), this routine goes through the line and changes any
keywords or their abbreviations, which do not appear in quotes, into
their corresponding token.  This command is vectored through RAM at
772 ($304), so it can be diverted in order to add new commands.
