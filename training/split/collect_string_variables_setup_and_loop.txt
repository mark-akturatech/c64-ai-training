# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Sets up and iterates over string variables: sets garbage-collection step size to 7 ($53), loads the start-of-variables pointer ($2D/$2E) into the working pointer ($22/$23), compares against variable/array boundaries, and repeatedly calls the variable-salvageability check (JSR $B5BD) until all variables are processed or the variable area end is reached.
