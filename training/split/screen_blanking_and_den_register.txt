# COMMODORE 64 - Describes screen blanking via the DEN bit in register 17 ($11): setting DEN to '0' blanks the display and fills the screen with the exterior color from register 32 ($20). While blanked, only transparent (Phase 1) memory accesses are required, allowing full CPU use of the system bus; MOB data will still be accessed unless MOBs are disabled. Notes that DEN must be '1' for normal video display.

  OTHER FEATURES

  SCREEN BLANKING

    The display screen may be blanked by setting the DEN bit in register
  17 ($11) to a "0". When the screen is blanked, the entire screen will be
  filled with the exterior color as set in register 32 ($20). When blanking
  is active, only transparent (Phase 1) memory accesses are required, per-
  mitting full processor utilization of the system bus. MOB data, however,
  will be accessed if the MOBs are not also disabled. The DEN bit must be
  set to "1" for normal video display.
