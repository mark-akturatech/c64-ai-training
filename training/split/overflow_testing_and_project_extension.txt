# MACHINE - Notes and exercises about overflow: reminder that the example ML routine does not check for overflow, encouragement to test the largest number that can be multiplied by ten without error and observe behavior at overflow. Project suggestion: add overflow checks and decide on behavior (print message, set to zero, etc.) without breaking to the monitor. Reminder to adjust SOV pointer if the program grows.

                                                                        :108:

You may recall that our machine language program does not check for overflow.
RUN the program again, and see if you can find the highest number that can be
multiplied by ten without error.  What happens at time of overflow?  Is that
what you expected?

Project for enthusiasts:  Can you add checks for overflow to the above
program?  You must decide what to do if overflow occurs:  print a message;
set the value to zero; or whatever you decide.  But you shouldn't stop the
program or break to the monitor.  Such a thing would upset the program user.
Your program will be longer.  Don't forget, therefore, to change the SOV
pointer at $2D/$2E so that your program is safe from variables.
