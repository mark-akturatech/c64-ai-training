# NMOS 6510 - Cycle-by-cycle read/write timeline for a Zeropage Indirect,Y read-modify-write sequence. Covers the data-bus read/write columns, program counter fetches, direct offset fetch, dummy read before index addition, DO+X low/high address fetches, reads of old data and the dummy/unmodified write-back of old data. Includes the simulation link and the two footnotes explaining the dummy read and write-back behaviour.
