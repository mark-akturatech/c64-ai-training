# COMMODORE 64 - SYS <memory-location>: jumps to machine language routine beginning at specified memory location (used in direct or program mode). Machine code should end with RTS so BASIC resumes after SYS call. Example: SYS 64738 (jump to system cold start in ROM) and example of POKE then SYS to call short machine routine.

  SYS

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: SYS <memory-location>

    Action: This is the most common way to mix a BASIC program with a
  machine language program. The machine language program begins at the
  location given in the SYS statement. The system command SYS is used in
  either direct or program mode to transfer control of the microprocessor
  to an existing machine language program in memory. The memory-location
  given is by numeric expression and can be anywhere in memory, RAM or ROM.
    When you're using the SYS statement you must end that section of
  machine language code with an RTS (ReTurn from Subroutine) instruction
  so that when the machine language program is finished, the BASIC
  execution will resume with the  statement following the SYS command.

  EXAMPLES of SYS Statement:

    SYS 64738                      (Jump to System Cold Start in ROM)

    10 POKE 4400,96:SYS 4400       (Goes to machine code location 4400
                                    and returns immediately)
