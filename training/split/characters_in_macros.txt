# ca65 Users Guide - Character translation timing in macros: with -t option, character translation into target character set happens late. Strings are translated when part of .BYTE/.ASCIIZ; characters are translated when used in expressions. Be careful comparing characters against numeric values inside macros because of translation timing.

When using the -t option, characters are translated into the target character set of the specific machine. However, this happens as late as possible. This means that strings are translated if they are part of a .BYTE or .ASCIIZ command. Characters are translated as soon as they are used as part of an expression.

This behaviour is very intuitive outside of macros but may be confusing when doing more complex macros. If you compare characters against numeric values, be sure to take the translation into account.
