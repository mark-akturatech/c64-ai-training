# MACHINE - PET/CBM uncrashing procedure for later models: requires hardware additions (toggle switch from PUP diagnostic sense pin 5 to ground, and a momentary reset pushbutton to ground the reset line). Toggle ON and press pushbutton to return to machine language monitor; then exit to BASIC (.X) and issue CLR or use '.;' followed by RETURN. Warns original ROM PETs cannot be uncrashed and recommends seeking hardware-savvy assistance for modifications.

PET/CBM
-------

Original ROM PETs cannot be uncrashed.

Subsequent models can be uncrashed, though hardware additions are necessary.
The reader should find someone with computer hardware knowledge to assist in
fitting the switches to the computer.

A toggle switch is needed, to be connected to the "diagnostic sense" line of
the parallel user port; that's pin 5 of the PUP.  The other side of the
toggle switch should connect to ground (pin 12).

Additionally, a momentary pushbutton is required.  This must connect the
reset line of the computer to ground.  Technically speaking, it's better to
trigger the input of the computer's power-on reset chip (a 555 one-shot),
using a resistor to guard against accidentally grounding a live circuit.

To uncrash, set the toggle switch to "on" and press the pushbutton; the
machine will come back to life in the machine language monitor.  Set the
toggle switch off.  There's more work to do.

The computer is still in an unstable state.  To correct this, either of two
actions may be taken.  You may return to BASIC with .X and immediately give
the command CLR; alternatively, you may type .; followed by the RETURN key.

Whatever investigation or other action is needed should be performed quickly
and the computer reset to its normal state.
