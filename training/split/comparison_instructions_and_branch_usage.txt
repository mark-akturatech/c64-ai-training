# MACHINE - How to compare bytes using CMP/CPX/CPY (value must be in A/X/Y and the other value in memory or immediate). List of branch tests available after compare (BEQ, BNE, BCS, BCC). Examples showing how to combine branches to test for 'less than or equal to' (CPY #$05 then BEQ/BCC) and an optimized version (CPY #$06 then BCC). Emphasis on using common sense to reason about comparisons.

A Note on Comparison
--------------------

If we wish to compare two bytes with each other, we must perform a
comparison.  One value must be in a register (A, X, or Y); the other must be
either stored in memory, or must be an immediate value we use in the
instruction.

We will use the appropriate compare instruction depending on the register
involved; CMP for the A register, CPX for the X register, and CPY for the Y
register.  Following the comparison, we may use any of the following branch
tests:

  BEQ--branches if the two bytes are equal.
  BNE--branches if the two bytes are not equal.
  BCS--branches if the value in the register is greater than or equal to the
       other value.
  BCC--branches if the value in the register is less than the other value.

We can use more than one branch instruction after a comparison.  Suppose our
program wanted to test the Y register for a value equal or less than 5.  We
might code

  CPY #$05
  BEQ ..somewhere
  BCC ..somewhere

We can see that our code will branch if the value is equal to 5 (using the
BEQ) or less than 5 (using the BCC); otherwise it will continue without
branching.  In this case, we could make the coding more efficient by changing
it to read

                                                                         :47:

  CPY #$06
  BCC ..somewhere

A little common sense will tell us that testing a number to see if it is less
than 6 is the same as testing it to see if it is less than or equal to 5.
Common sense is a valuable programming tool.
