# byRiclianll - BASIC 'JOB QUEUE' subroutine that implements drive communication and retry logic. Covers the REM header, initialization of TRY, PRINT#15 commands to send M-W and M-R messages (including the job identifier bytes), GET#15 response reading, conversion of the returned character to numeric E, retry/time‑out branching (go-to lines), closing channel 15, and the failure message and END. This chunk contains the full BASIC-level handshake and retry/response handling used to send commands to the drive.
