# COMMODORE 64 - Time Of Day (TOD) clock: 24-hour (AM/PM) BCD clock with 1/10s resolution; register organization (10ths, seconds, minutes, hours) and AM/PM flag in Hours MSB; external 60/50 Hz TOD pin requirement; ALARM functionality with ALARM registers sharing TOD addresses and ALARM being write-only; CRB7 selects TOD vs ALARM access on write; required read/write sequence and latching behavior (writing Hours stops clock, writing 10ths restarts; latched on read of Hours until read of 10ths so reads remain consistent). Includes TOD read register format table.


  Time of Day Clock (TOD)

    The TOD clock is a special purpose timer for real-time applications.
  TOD consists of a 24-hour (AM/PM) clock with 1/10th second resolution. It
  is organized into 4 registers: 10ths of seconds, Seconds, Minutes and
  Hours. The AM/PM flag is in the MSB of the Hours register for easy bit
  testing. Each register reads out in BCD format to simplify conversion for
  driving displays, etc. The clock requires an external 60 Hz or 50 Hz
  (programmable) TTL level input on the TOD pin for accurate time-keeping.
  In addition to time-keeping, a programmable ALARM is provided for
  generating an interrupt at a desired time. The ALARM registers or located
  at the same addresses as the corresponding TOD registers. Access to the
  ALARM is governed by a Control Register bit. The ALARM is write-only; any
  read of a TOD address will read time regardless of the state of the ALARM
  access bit.
    A specific sequence of events must be followed for proper setting and
  reading of TOD. TOD is automatically stopped whenever a write to the
  Hours register occurs. The clock will not start again until after a write
  to the 10ths of seconds register. This assures TOD will always start at
  the desired time. Since a carry from one stage to the next can occur at

                                                           APPENDIX M   431

  any time with respect to a read operation, a latching function is
  included to keep all Time Of Day information constant during a read
  sequence. All four TOD registers latch on a read of Hours and remain
  latched until after a read of 10ths of seconds. The TOD clock continues
  to count when the output registers are latched. If only one register is
  to be read, there is no carry problem and the register can be read "on
  the fly," provided that any read of Hours is followed by a read of 10ths
  of seconds to disable the latching.
