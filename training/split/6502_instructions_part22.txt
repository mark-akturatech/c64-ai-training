# 6502 Arithmetic - Decimal Mode (BCD) Operations

               dec      binary     hex
               100   %0110.0100    $64
            + -24    %1110.1000    $E8
            ------------------------
                76   %0100.1100    $4C   (+ carry)
          Note: We may now see how SBC actually works, by adding ones' complement of
            the operand to the accumulator. If we add 1 from the carry to the result,
            this effectively results in a subtraction in two's complement (the inverse
            of the operand + 1). If the carry happens to be zero, the result falls
            short by 1 in terms of two's complement, which is equivalent to adding 1
            to the operand before the subtraction. Thus, the carry either provides
            the correction required for a valid two's complement representation or,
            if missing, results in a subtraction including a binary borrow.
          FLags with ADC and SBC
          Besides the carry flag (C), which allows us to chain multi-byte operations, the
          CPU sets the following flags on the result of an arithmetic operation:
            zero flag (Z) ........ set if the result is zero, else unset
            negative flag (N) ... the N flag always reflects the sign bit of the result
            overflow flag (V) ... indicates overflow in signed operations
          The latter may require explanation: how is signed overflow different from
          the carry flag? The overflow flag is about a certain ambiguity of the sign bit
          and the negative flag in signed context: if operands are of the same sign, the
          case may occure, where the sign bit flips (as indicated by a change of the
          negative flag), while the result is still of the same sign. This condition is
          indicated by the overflow flag. Notably, such an overflow can never occur, when
          the operands are of opposite signs.
                                                                   6502 Instruction Set
          E.g., adding positive $40 to positive $40:
                         acc.       acc.       flags
                         hex      binary       NVDIZC
            LDA #$40     $40   %0100.0000      000000
            ADC #$40     $80   %1000.0000      110000
          Here, the change of the sign bit is unrelated to the actual value in the
          accumulator, it is merely a consequence of carry propagation from bit 6 to
          bit 7, the sign bit. Since both operands are positive, the result must be
          positive, as well.
          The overflow flag (V) is of interest in signed context only and has no meaning
          in unsigned context.
          Decimal Mode (BCD)
          Besides binary arithmetic, the 6502 processor supports a second mode, binary
          coded decimal (BCD), where each byte, rather than representing a range of 0…255,
          represents two decimal digits packed into a single byte. For this, a byte is
          thought divided into two sections of 4 bits, the high- and the low-nibble. Only
          values from 0…9 are used for each nibble and a byte can represent a range of a
          2-digit decimal value only, as in 0…99.
          E.g.,
            dec      binary     hex
             14   %0001.0100    $14
             98   %1001.1000    $98
          Mind how this intuitively translates to hexadecimal notation, where figures
          A…F are never used.
          Whether or not the processor is in decimal mode is determined by the decimal
          flag (D). If it is set (using SED) the processor will use BCD arithmetic.
          If it is cleared (using CLD), the processor is in binary mode.
          Decimal mode only affects instructions ADC and SBC (but not INC or DEC.)
          Examples:
            SED
            CLC
            LDA #$12
            ADC #$44   ;accumulator now holds $56
            SED
            CLC
                                                                   6502 Instruction Set
            LDA #$28
            ADC #$14  ;accumulator now holds $42
          Mind that BCD mode is always unsigned:
                      acc. NVDIZC
            SED
            SEC
            LDA #0    $00  001011
            SBC #1    $99  101000
          The carry flag and the zero flag work in decimal mode as expected.
          The negative flag is set similar to binary mode (and of questionable value.)
          The overflow flag has no meaning in decimal mode.
          Multi-byte operations are just as in decimal mode: We first prepare the carry
          and then chain operations of the individual bytes in increasing value order,
          starting with the lowest value pair.
          (It may be important to note that Western Design Center (WDC) version of
          the processor, the 65C02, always clears the decimal flag when it enters an
          interrupt, while the original NMOS version of the 6502 does not.)
