# COMMODORE 64 - KERNAL SETMSG (call $FF90 / 65424): Control KERNAL message output (error and control messages). Use accumulator bits 6 and 7 to control message printing: bit7=1 prints an error message; bit6=1 prints control messages. Example: LDA #$40 ; JSR SETMSG (turn on control messages); LDA #$80 ; JSR SETMSG (turn on error messages); LDA #0 ; JSR SETMSG (turn off messages).

  B-29. Function Name: SETMSG

    Purpose: Control system message output
    Call address: $FF90 (hex) 65424 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns: None
    Stack requirements: 2
    Registers affected: A

    Description: This routine controls the printing of error and control
  messages by the KERNAL. Either print error messages or print control mes-
  sages can be selected by setting the accumulator when the routine is
  called. FILE NOT FOUND is an example of an error message. PRESS PLAY ON
  CASSETTE is an example of a control message.
    Bits 6 and 7 of this value determine where the message will come from.
  If bit 7 is 1, one of the error messages from the KERNAL is printed. If
  bit 6 is set, control messages are printed.

  How to Use:

    1) Set accumulator to desired value.
    2) Call this routine.

  EXAMPLE:

    LDA #$40
    JSR SETMSG          ;TURN ON CONTROL MESSAGES
    LDA #$80
    JSR SETMSG          ;TURN ON ERROR MESSAGES
    LDA #0
    JSR SETMSG          ;TURN OFF ALL KERNAL MESSAGES
