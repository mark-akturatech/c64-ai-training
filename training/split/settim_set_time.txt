# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - SETTIM: Set realtime jiffy clock (vectored at $ffdb). On entry (A/X/Y) holds high/mid/low clock bytes to store into $A0/$A1/$A2. Disables interrupts (SEI) during write, then enables CLI and returns.

                                *** SETTIM: SET TIME
                                The KERNAL routine SETTIM ($ffdb) jumps to this routine.
                                On entry, (A/X/Y) must hold the value to be stored in the
                                clock. The format is high/mid/low, and clock resolution is
                                1/60 second. SEI is included since part of the IRQ routine
                                is to update the clock.
