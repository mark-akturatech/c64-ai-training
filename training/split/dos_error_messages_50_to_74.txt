# ********* - Disk Operating System (DOS) error messages 50 through 74 with short explanations. Covers: RECORD NOT PRESENT (50), OVERFLOW IN RECORD (51), FILE TOO LARGE (52), WRITE FILE OPEN (60), FILE NOT OPEN (61), FILE NOT FOUND (62), FILE EXISTS (63), FILE TYPE MISMATCH (64), NO BLOCK (65) with B-A context and parameters, ILLEGAL TRACK AND SECTOR (66), ILLEGAL SYSTEM T OR S (67), NO CHANNEL (70) and channel limits, DIRECTORY ERROR (71) with BAM note, DISK FULL (72), DOS MISMATCH (73) with explanation of read/write incompatibility, and DRIVE NOT READY (74) when no diskette is present.

by the DOS.

50: RECORD NOT PRESENT -- Result of disk reading past the last record
through INPUT#, or GET# commands.  This message will also occur after
positioning to a record beyond end of file in a relative file.  If the
intent is to expand the file by adding the new record (with a PRINT#
command), the error message may be ignored.  INPUT or GET should not
be attempted after this error is detected without first repositioning.

51: OVERFLOW IN RECORD -- PRINT# statement exceeds record boundary.
Information is cut off.  Since the carriage return is sent as a record
terminator is counted in the record size.  This message will occur if
the total characters in the record (including the final carriage
return) exceeds the defined size.

52: FILE TOO LARGE -- Record position within a relative file indicates
that disk overflow will result.

60: WRITE FILE OPEN -- This message is generated when a write file
that has not been closed is being opened for reading.

61: FILE NOT OPEN -- This message is generated when a file is being
accessed that has not been opened in the DOS.  Sometimes, in this case,
a message is not generated; the request is simply ignored.

62: FILE NOT FOUND -- The requested file does not exist on the
indicated drive.

63: FILE EXISTS -- The file name of the file being created already
exists on the diskette.

64: FILE TYPE MISMATCH -- The file type does not match the file type
in the directory entry for the requested file.

65: NO BLOCK -- This message occurs in conjunction with the B-A
command.  It indicates that the block to be allocated has been
previously allocated.  The parameters indicate the track and sector
available with the next highest number.  If the parameters are zero
(0), then all blocks higher in number are in use.

66: ILLEGAL TRACK AND SECTOR -- The DOS has attempted to access a
track or block which does not exist in the format being used.  This
may indicate a problem reading the pointer to the next block.

67: ILLEGAL SYSTEM T OR S -- This special error message indicates an
illegal system track or block.

70: NO CHANNEL (available) -- The requested channel is not available,
or all channels are in use.  A maximum of five sequential files may be
opened at one time to the DOS.  Direct access channels may have six
opened files.

71: DIRECTORY ERROR -- The BAM does not match the internal count.
There is a problem in the BAM allocation or the BAM has been
overwritten in DOS memory.  To correct this problem, reinitialize the
diskette to restore the BAM in memory.  Some active files may be
terminated by the corrective action.  NOTE: BAM = Block Availability
Map

72: DISK FULL -- Either the blocks on the diskette are used or the
directory is at its entry limit. DISK FULL is sent when two blocks are
available on the 1541 to allow the current file to be closed.

73: DOS MISMATCH (73, CBM DOS V2.6 1541) -- DOS 1 and 2 are read
compatible but not write compatible.  Disks may be interchangeably
read with either DOS, but a disk formatted on one version cannot be
written upon with the other version because the format is different.
This error is displayed whenever an attempt is made to write upon a
disk which has been formatted in a non-compatible format. (A utility
routine is available to assist in converting from one format to
another.) This message may also appear after power up.

74: DRIVE NOT READY -- An attempt has been made to access the 1541
Single Drive Floppy Disk without any diskettes present in either drive.
