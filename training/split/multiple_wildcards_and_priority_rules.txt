# byRiclianll - Demonstrates using more than one wildcard in the same scratch command (example: "T?ST*") and lists filenames that would be scratched (TEST, TASTY, TESTING123) and one that would not (TOAST). Explains that '*' has priority over '?' — any characters after '*' are ignored — and notes nonsensical patterns like "T*ST???".

More  than  one  wild  card  can  be  used  within  the  same  command.  For  example: 

EXAMPLE:    OPEN   15,    8,  15 

PRINT#15,  "SO:T?ST*" 
CLOSE  15 

DOS  5. l:  >SO:T?ST* 

This  command  would  scratch  files  with  these  names:  TEST,  TASTY,  TESTING123.  The 
file  TOAST  would  not  be  affected.  Note  that  it  makes  no  sense  to  send  a  command  like 
this:  "SO:T*ST???".  The  asterisk  has  priority  over  the  question  mark.  All  characters 
that  appear  after  the  asterisk  are  ignored.
