# byRiclianll - Section 3.1: Tracks (1-35) are concentric; track 1 outermost, track 35 innermost. Each track is divided into 17 or more sectors; each sector holds 256 bytes. Commodore uses zone bit rates: outer tracks have more sectors. Table of track zones: Zone 1 (tracks 1-17) sectors 0-20 (21 sectors), Zone 2 (18-24) 19 sectors, Zone 3 (25-30) 18 sectors, Zone 4 (31-35) 17 sectors. Total of 683 sectors created at format time. Effective usable sectors after directory/BAM reduce to 664 sectors (169,984 bytes).

3.1  Layout  of  Tracks  and  Sectors 

During  the  formatting  (newing)  process,  the  DOS  divides  the  diskette  into  tracks  and 
sectors.  A  track  is  a  circular  path  on  the  diskette  along  which  information  is  stored. 
Each  track  is  concentric  with  the  hole  in  the  center  of  the  diskette.  There  are  a  total 
of  35  tracks  numbered  from  1  to  35.  Track  1  is  the  outermost  track  and  track  35  is  the 
innermost  track.  The  read/write  head  may  be  positioned  to  any  given  track.  The  posi- 
tion of  track  1  is  determined  by  a  mechanical  stop  that  limits  the  outward  movement 
of  the  read/write  head.  The  other  tracks  are  identified  by  their  distance  from  track  1. 
The  diagram  below  indicates  the  layout  of  the  tracks  on  a  formatted  diskette.

Although  there  are  only  35  tracks,  the  stepper  motor  can  position  the  read/write  head 
to  more  than  70  different  positions.  This  might  seem  to  imply  that  additional  tracks  could 
be  recorded  on  the  surface  of  the  diskette  to  increase  its  storage  capacity.  Unfortunate- 
ly, the  accuracy  of  the  head  positioning  mechanism  and  the  width  of  the  path  of  magnetiza- 
tion produced  by  the  read/write  head  makes  the  use  of  these  "phantom"  tracks  unreliable. 
If  you  would  like  to  experiment  with  this,  the  programs  described  in  Chapter  9  allow 
you  to  experiment  with  stepping  the  head  around. 

Each  track  is  divided  into  seventeen  or  more  sectors  (blocks).  Each  sector  holds  256 
bytes  of  data.  (Some  manufacturer's  record  data  in  512  or  1024  byte  sectors.)  Whenever 
data  is  read  from  or  written  to  a  diskette,  it  is  done  one  complete  sector  at  a  time. 

On  Commodore  disk  drives,  the  tracks  are  not  divided  into  a  fixed  number  of  sectors. 
The  number  of  sectors  depends  on  the  track  number.  The  outer  tracks  Qower  numbers) 
are  longer  and  are  divided  into  more  sectors  than  the  inner  (higher  numbered)  tracks. 
The  table  below  summarizes  how  the  diskette  is  organized.

A  total  of  683  sectors  are  written  at  the  time  of  initial  formatting.  Since  the  disk  rotates 
at  a  constant  speed  of  300  rpm,  you  may  wonder  how  Commodore  manages  to  vary  the 
number  of  sectors  from  zone  to  zone.  This  is  accomplished  by  varying  the  rate  at  which 
data  is  read  or  written  (changing  the  clock  rate).  Each  of  the  four  zones  uses  a  different
