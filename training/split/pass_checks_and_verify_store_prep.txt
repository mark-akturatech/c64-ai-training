# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL ROM Disassembly (English, "CBM") - End-of-block and pass management: RD70/after CMPSTE checks whether end of storage area reached, handles short/long block errors (SBERR/LBERR via UDST), checks FSBLK to determine which pass is active (first or second), decides load vs verify based on VERCK, and for verify compares incoming OCHAR with memory (SAL) and marks PRP on mismatch. Prepares to log bad locations for later re-reads by storing addresses into BAD table when errors detected.
