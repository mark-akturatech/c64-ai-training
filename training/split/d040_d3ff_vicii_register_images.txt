# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $D040-$D3FF — VIC-II Register Images: the VIC decodes only 64 addresses; the 1K window is mirrored every 64 bytes. Example: POKE 53281+64,1 is same as POKE 53281,1. Advises using base addresses for clarity.

$D040-$D3FF               VIC-II Register Images

                          Since the VIC-II requires only enough addressing lines to handle 64
                          locations (the minimum possible for its 47 registers), none of the
                          higher bits are decoded when addressing this 1K area.  The result is
                          that every 64 byte area in this 1K block is a mirror of every other.
                          POKE53281+64,1 has the same effect as POKE53281,1 or
                          POKE53281+10*64,1; they all turn the screen background to white.  For
                          the sake of clarity in your programs it is advisable to use the base
                          address of the chip.
