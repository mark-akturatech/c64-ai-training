# ********* - Explains keyboard/joystick confusion because CIA #1 Data Port B is used for both keyboard rows and joystick 1. Presents techniques to avoid false reads: temporarily turning off keyscan (POKE 56333,127:POKE 56320,255 and restore with POKE 56333,129) or clearing keyboard buffer (POKE 198,0).

The problem of mistaking the keyboard for the joystick can be solved
by turning off the keyscan momentarily when reading the stick with a
POKE 56333, 127:POKE 56320,255, and restoring it after the read with a
POKE 56333,129.  Sometimes you can use the simpler solution of
clearing the keyboard buffer after reading the joystick, with a POKE
198,0.

The problem of mistaking the joystick for a keypress is much more
difficult--there is no real way to turn off the joystick.  Many
commercially available games just use Controller Port 2 to avoid the
