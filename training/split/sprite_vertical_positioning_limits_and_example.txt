# COMMODORE 64 - Vertical (Y) positioning: 200 visible dot positions (0..199) exist. Sprite Y registers can hold 0..255 to allow smooth on/off-screen movement. First on-screen Y for unexpanded sprite is 30 (for expanded it is 9). Sprite is fully on-screen (all 21 lines) starting at Y=50; last fully-on for unexpanded is 229; expanded last fully-on is 208. Fully off occurs at Y=250. Includes simple BASIC example showing enabling sprite, setting pointer, sprite data and X/Y positions.

    The position of a sprite is calculated from the TOP LEFT corner of the
  24 dot by 21 dot area that your sprite can be designed in. It does NOT
  matter how many or how few dots you use to make up a sprite. Even if only
  one dot is used as a sprite, and you happen to want it in the middle of
  the screen, you must still calculate the exact positioning by starting at
  the top left corner location.

  VERTICAL POSITIONING

    Setting up positions in the horizontal direction is a little more
  difficult than vertical positioning, so we'll discuss vertical (Y)
  positioning first.

    There are 200 different dot positions that can be individually pro-
  grammed onto your TV screen in the Y direction. The sprite Y position
  registers can handle numbers up to 255. This means that you have more
  than enough register locations to handle moving a sprite up and down. You
  also want to be able to smoothly move a sprite on and off the screen.
  More than 200 values are needed for this.
    The first on-screen value from the top of the screen, and in the Y
  direction for an unexpanded sprite is 30. For a sprite expanded in the Y
  direction it would be 9. (Since each dot is twice as tall, this makes a
  certain amount of sense, as the initial position is STILL calculated from
  the top left corner of the sprite.)
    The first Y value in which a sprite (expanded or not) is fully on the
  screen (all 21 possible lines displayed) is 50.
    The last Y value in which an unexpanded sprite is fully on the screen
  is 229. The last Y value in which an expanded sprite is fully on the
  screen is 208.
    The first Y value in which a sprite is fully off the screen is 250.

  EXAMPLE:

start tok64 page139.prg
  10 print"{clear}"                :rem clear screen
  20 poke 2040,13                  :rem get sprite 0 data from block 13
  30 fori=0to62:poke832+i,129:next :rem poke sprite data into block 13
  40 v=53248                       :rem set beginning of video chip
  50 pokev+21,1                    :rem enable sprite 0
  60 pokev+39,1                    :rem set sprite 0 color
  70 pokev+1,100                   :rem set sprite 0 y position
  80 pokev+16,0:pokev,100          :rem set sprite 0 x position
stop tok64
