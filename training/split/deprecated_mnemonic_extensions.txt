# Kick Assembler - Documents deprecated mnemonic extensions (kept for backward compatibility) that explicitly indicate addressing modes. Lists the extension tokens and the modes they force, with examples: im/imm (immediate), z/zp (zeropage) e.g. ldx.z $1234, zx/zpx (zeropage,X) e.g. lda.zpx table, zy/zpy (zeropage,Y), izx/izpx (indirect zeropage,X), izy/izpy (indirect zeropage,Y), ax/absx (absolute,X), ay/absy (absolute,Y), I/ind (indirect), r/rel (relative). Includes final example usages such as lda.absx $1234 and jmp.i $1000.

With the following extensions you can force specific modes. The are deprecated and only kept for backward
compatibility:
