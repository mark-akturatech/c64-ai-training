# Kick Assembler - Section 9.4: The .namespace directive and how it places symbols/labels inside a named namespace, examples of defining vic.* labels and using them (vic.borderColor), and .filenamespace to place an entire file's content into a namespace — usage example for file partitioning.

9.4. The Namespace Directives
As already seen you can declare namespaces with the namespace directive. When declared it places a symbol
inside the scope the parent namespace so the labels inside can be accessed as local fields of the namespace symbol:
.namespace vic {
.label borderColor = $d020
.label backgroundColor0 = $d021
.label backgroundColor1 = $d022

Scopes and Namespaces

.label backgroundColor2 = $d023
}
lda #0
sta vic.backgroundColor0
sta vic.borderColor

Namespaces are normally used to make sure that code in a source file (Like a library) is not colliding with
other parts of the code. For this, Place the filenamespace directive at the top of the file and everything after that
is placed in the desired namespace:
/* FILE 0 */
jsr part1.init
jsr part1.exec
jsr part2.init
jsr part2.exec
rts
/* FILE 1 */
.filenamespace part1
init:
...
