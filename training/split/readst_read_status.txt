# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - READST: Read status (vectored from $ffb7). If current device number FA ($BA) == $02 (RS232), returns RSSTAT ($0297) and clears it. Otherwise returns STATUS ($90). Uses LDA/STA/PLA on zero page to save/restore values.

                                *** READST: READ STATUS
                                The KERNAL routine READST ($ffb7) jumps to this routine.
                                The routine checks if the current devicenumber is 2, (ie
                                RS232) then the value of RSSTAT (the ACIA 6551 status)is
                                returned in (A), and RSSTAT is cleared. Else it reads and
                                returns the value of STATUS.
