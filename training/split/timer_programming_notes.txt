# CIA 6526 Complex Interface Adapter - Comprehensive Reference - Practical notes for programming CIA timers: resolution at PHI2 (~985,248 Hz PAL / 1,022,727 Hz NTSC) making minimum period about 1 microsecond and maximum single 16-bit period ~65.5 ms. Cascading A and B yields a 32-bit timer (~71.8 minutes PAL). One-shot vs continuous mode explained. Latch vs counter: writes go to latch; latch transferred to counter on underflow (continuous), via force-load (CRA/CRB bit 4), or when timer starts. Timer underflow output on PB6/PB7 can be pulse mode (one PHI2 cycle) or toggle mode (invert each underflow) useful for waveforms or timing signals.

9. TIMER PROGRAMMING NOTES
=============================================================

Timer Resolution:
  At PHI2 clock rate of approximately 985,248 Hz (PAL) or
  1,022,727 Hz (NTSC), the minimum timer period is about 1
  microsecond, and the maximum single timer period is about
  65.5 milliseconds (65536 cycles).

  Cascading Timer A and Timer B provides a 32-bit timer with
  a maximum period of approximately 71.8 minutes (PAL).

One-Shot vs Continuous:
  - Continuous mode: Timer reloads from latch and continues
    counting on underflow. Used for periodic interrupts.
  - One-Shot mode: Timer stops after single underflow. Useful
    for precise delay generation.

Timer Latch vs Counter:
  - Writing to timer registers always writes to the LATCH,
    not directly to the counter.
  - The latch is transferred to the counter when:
    (a) Timer underflows in continuous mode
    (b) Force load bit (CRA/CRB bit 4) is set
    (c) Timer transitions from stopped to running (START bit
        goes from 0 to 1)

Output to Port B:
  Timer underflow output on PB6 (Timer A) or PB7 (Timer B) can
  be either:
  - Pulse mode: PB6/PB7 goes high for one PHI2 cycle on underflow
  - Toggle mode: PB6/PB7 inverts state on each underflow
  This is useful for generating waveforms or timing signals.
