# MACHINE - Provides opcode values for common instructions used in the example (LDA AD, LDX AE, LDY AC, BRK 00, STA 8D, STX 8E, STY 8C). Shows full assembled machine-code listing for the swap program, explains left-side object code vs right-side assembly/source code, defines assembly/hand-assembly, and notes the assembled program length (13 bytes).

                                                                         :13:

Here are some machine language op codes for the instructions we may use.  You
do not need to memorize them:

  LDA - AD     LDX - AE     LDY - AC     BRK - 00
  STA - 8D     STX - 8E     STY - 8C

Now we can compete the translation of our program:

  AD 80 03     LDA $0380
  AE 81 03     LDX $0381
  8D 81 03     STA $0381
  8E 80 03     STX $0380
  00           BRK

On the right, we have our plan.  On the left, we have the actual program that
will be stored in the computer.  We may call the right side assembly code and
the left side machine code, to distinguish between them.  Some users call the
right-hand information source code, since that's where we start to plan the
program, and the left-hand program object code, since that's the object of
the exercise--to get code into the computer.  The job of translating source
code to object code is called assembly.  We performed this translation by
looking up the op codes and translating by hand; this is called hand
assembly.

The code must be placed into the computer.  It will consist of 13 bytes:  AD
80 08 AE 81 03 8D 81 03 8E 80 03 00.  That's the whole program.  But we have
a new question:  where do we put it?
