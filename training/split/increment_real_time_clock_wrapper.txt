# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Wrapper at $FFEA that JMPs to $F69B to increment the real time clock (normally called from IRQ at 1/60s).

                                *** increment real time clock
                                this routine updates the system clock. Normally this routine is called by the
                                normal KERNAL interrupt routine every 1/60th of a second. If the user program
                                processes its own interrupts this routine must be called to update the time. Also,
                                the STOP key routine must be called if the stop key is to remain functional.
