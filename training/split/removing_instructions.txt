# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Remove unnecessary instructions to save cycles; e.g., some CLC instructions can sometimes be omitted if flags are already correct.

Removing Instructions
So the first rule of thumb would be: remove all unnecessary instructions. All instructions take a few machine cycles to execute, so by removing some of them, you're speeding up your code. An example of an instruction that can sometimes be removed without affecting the result is CLC. Read through the critical section of your code and try to find instructions to remove.
