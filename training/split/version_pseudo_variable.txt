# ca65 Users Guide - .VERSION: returns the assembler version encoded as (VER_MAJOR * 0x100) + VER_MINOR, with major in the upper 8 bits and minor in the lower 8 bits. Example: assembler version 47.11 would produce 0x2f0b. Notes that older assembler versions (until 2.19) used a broken formula which produced incorrect values starting at 2.16; therefore .VERSION is considered informal and should not be relied upon for exact version checks.

9.7 .VERSION
Reading this pseudo variable will give the assembler version according to the following formula:

(VER_MAJOR * 0x100) + VER_MINOR

The upper 8 bits are the major-, the lower 8 bits are the minor version.

Example:

For example, version 47.11 of the assembler would have this macro defined as 0x2f0b.

Note: until 2.19 this pseudo variable was defined as (VER_MAJOR * 0x100) + VER_MINOR * 0x10 - which resulted in broken values starting at version 2.16 of the assembler. For this reason the value of this pseudo variable is considered purely informal - you should not use it to check for a specific assembler version and use different code according to the detected version - please update your code to work with the recent version of the assembler instead (There is very little reason to not use the most recent version - and even less to support older versions in your code).
