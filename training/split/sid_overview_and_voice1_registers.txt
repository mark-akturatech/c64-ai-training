# COMMODORE 64 - MOS 6581 SID overall address range and Voice 1 register map (D400-D406). Includes the SID device range header (D400-D7FF) and detailed Voice 1 registers: D400/D401 frequency low/high, D402/D403 pulse waveform width (low byte and high nybble), D404 control register waveform enable bits (triangle/saw/pulse/noise), control bits (test, ring modulation, sync, gate), and envelope generator 1 controls D405 (attack/decay) and D406 (sustain/release). Table headings and bit descriptions for Voice 1 are included.
