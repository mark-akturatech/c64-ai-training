# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Re-use computation results between frames or code paths to avoid redundant expensive calculations; cache results in tables or variables when appropriate.

Re-using Stuff
In some cases you can reuse results of computations in smart ways. If you realize that your code is, for some reason, computing the same value twice each frame, and the calculation takes some time, store the value in a table and just look it up the next time you need it.

Re-using stuff can even be as simple as plotting the same point in different places on the screen.
