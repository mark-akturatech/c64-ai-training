# MACHINE - CRTC Register R4: Vertical Total — 7-bit register containing total number of character rows in a frame minus one. Combined with R5 this determines frame rate and vertical timing.

Vertical Total (R4)
-------------------

The Vertical Total Register is a 7-bit register containing the total number
of character rows in a frame, minus one.  This register, along with R5,
determines the overall frame rate, which should be close to the line
frequency to ensure flicker-free appearance.  If the frame time is adjusted
to be longer than the period of the line frequency, then /RES may be used to
provide absolute synchronism.
