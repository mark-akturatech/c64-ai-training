# NMOS 6510 - Indexed addressing: description of dummy read behaviour for absolute indexed instructions when indexing causes a page crossing. Lists many instructions (ADC/AND/CMP/EOR/LDA/ORA/SBC/STA/LDX/LDY/TAS/SHX/SHY etc) and supplies a per-cycle diagram showing the dummy read from <AAH,AAL+IL> before the high byte is corrected. Notes to add a cycle on page-cross or write.


R/W

(*) Add one cycle for indexing across page boundaries or write. A dummy read happens to the target
address before the high byte was corrected.

Example: acknowledge both CIA interrupts

This will do a dummy read at $DC0D and a normal read at $DD0D, this way you can acknowledge
both CIA interrupts in one instruction:
LDX #$F0
LDA $DC1D, X
… and is one cycle faster, and one byte shorter, than doing
LDA $DC0D
LDA $DD0D

Example: 5 cycle wide rastersplits

If you want to have raster splits that are exactly 5 cycles wide, you can use:
LDX #$FF
LDY #$05
LDA #$00
STY $D021
STA $CF22, X
Example: Sprites far right in the border

To feed data to the sprite pattern pipe for a sprite that is displayed “far right” so it did not yet have
its DMA cycles before you can use a
STA VIC_REG, X
at the correct position in the rasterline, s.t. the 4th cycle occurs at the first sprite DMA-cycle and the
5th (the W-cycle) at the 2nd sprite DMA-cycle. This way the sprite pattern byte is filled with:
1. byte read in 4th cycle from the (uncorrected!) VIC-address
2. ghostbyte
3. byte stored in 5th cycle
