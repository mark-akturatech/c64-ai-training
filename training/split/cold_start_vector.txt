# ********* - Cold Start Vector (locations 40960-40961 / $A000-$A001): points to BASIC initialization routine invoked after OS power-on init; prints the welcome message and BYTES FREE. References ROM entry at 58260 ($E394) for details of initialization.

It should be noted that when BASIC is not neede,d it can be switched
out and the RAM underneath can be accessed by the VIC-II chip and used
for screen graphics.  See location 56576 ($DD00) for more information.

40960-40961   $A000-$A001
Cold Start Vector

This vector points to the address of the routine used to initialize
BASIC.  After the Operating System finishes its power-on activities,
it enters the BASIC program through this vector.  The most visible
effect of the BASIC initialization routine is that the screen is
cleared, and the words:

     **** COMMODORE 64 BASIC V2 ****

are printed along with the BYTES FREE message.  For details of the
steps taken during the initialization of BASIC, see the entry for
58260 ($E394), the current cold start entry point.
