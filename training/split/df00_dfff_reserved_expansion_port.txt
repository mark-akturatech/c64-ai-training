# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Expansion port I/O region ($DF00-$DFFF): not used by internal hardware but accessible via Expansion Port pin 10. Commodore mentioned possible uses like inexpensive parallel disk drive hardware.

$DF00-$DFFF               CIA #2 Register Images

                          This range of locations is not used directly by the 64's internal
                          hardware, but is accessible via pin 10 of the Expansion Port.  One
                          possible use for this I/O memory that Commodore has mentioned is an
                          inexpensive parallel disk drive (which presumable would be much faster
                          than the current serial model).
