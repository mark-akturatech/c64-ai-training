# A 256 Byte Autostart Fast Loader for the Commodore 64 - Autostart technique: instead of modifying BASIC vectors, the loader places code into the stack area ($01ED-$01F7) and relies on a jump at $0203 to catch execution when the ROM loader returns. Fills intervening bytes with $02 for compatibility with modified ROMs.


Autostart Mechanism
-------------------

Rather than overwriting BASIC vectors, the loader exploits the stack return
address. Code loads into the stack region ($01ED-$01F7), with a jump
instruction at $0203 catching execution when the ROM loader returns.
Filling intervening bytes with $02 provides compatibility with modified ROMs.
