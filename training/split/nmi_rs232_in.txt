# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - NMI RS232 IN: Reads a received data bit from the RS232 port (CIA dataport $DD01), stores single-bit INBIT ($A7), loads and adjusts timer B (DD06/DD07) by subtracting a constant and adding BAUD offset (<BAUDOF >BAUDOF at $0299/$029A), starts CIA control register B ($DD0F) and re-enables CIA2 interrupts to continue receive. Jumps to RS232 receive routine at $EF59.

                                This routine inputs a bit from the RS232 port and sets the
                                baudrate timing for the next bit. Continues to the RS232
                                receive routine.
