# ********* - MAIN: the main BASIC program loop (addresses $A480-$A49B). It vectored through RAM at $302, receives a line of input, checks for a line number, and either branches to store the line in the program or to execute statements immediately.

Main Loop, Receives Input and Executes Immediately or Stores as
Program Line

This is the main BASIC program loop.  It jumps through the RAM vector
at 770 ($302), so this routine can be diverted.  The routine gets a
line of input from the keyboard, and checks for a line number.  If
there is a line number, the program branches to the routine that
stores a line of program text.  If there is no line number, it
branches to the routine that executes statements.
