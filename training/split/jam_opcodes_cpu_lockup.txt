# NMOS 6510 - Documentation of the JAM (also known as KIL/HLT/CIM/CRP) group of opcodes that lock up the 6502 CPU. Lists individual opcode bytes ($42, $52, $62, $72, $92, $B2, $D2, $F2) and states their effect: on execution the following byte is fetched, data and address buses are driven to $FF, program execution ceases, interrupts do not run, and only a reset can restart the CPU. Notes that these opcodes leave no register or flag trace. Provides a test-code reference (CPU/cpujam/cpujamXX.prg), a minimal example use-case to stop execution in tight demos (example assembly snippet: LDA #0 / STA $D418 / JAM / ;02), and a simulation link to the visual6502 JSSim. Includes page footer.

Operation: When one of these opcodes is executed, the byte following the opcode will be fetched,
data- and address bus will be set to $ff (all 1s) and program execution ceases. No hardware
interrupts will execute either. Only a reset will restart execution. This opcode leaves no trace of any
operation performed! No registers or flags affected.
Test code: CPU/cpujam/cpujamXX.prg
Example: stop execution

Sometimes in a very memory constrained situation (like a 4k demo), you may want to stop
execution of whatever is running with least effort – this can be achieved by using one of the JAM
opcodes. Keep in mind though that only the CPU will stop.
