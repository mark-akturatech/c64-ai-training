LAYER 3: BUS ARBITRATION - TALK/LISTEN PROTOCOL
================================================================================

Layer 3 implements bus arbitration based on IEEE-488, enabling controlled
communication between a computer controller and peripheral devices through
role assignment and address-based routing.

Controller & Devices:
  One computer acts as the designated controller, issuing commands to all
  other bus participants (devices). The controller itself has no address.
