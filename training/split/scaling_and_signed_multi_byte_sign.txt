# MACHINE - Notes on binary fractions and scaling (e.g., dollars as integer cents); for multi-byte signed numbers the sign is stored as the high bit of the highest byte only.


It's possible to work with binary fractions, but that is beyond the scope of
this book.  Many applications "scale" numbers, so that dollar-and-cents
amounts are held as integer quantities of pennies.  Thus, two bytes unsigned
would hold values up to $655.35, and three bytes up to $167,772.15.

When signed numbers are held in multiple bytes, the sign is the highest bit
of the highest byte only.
