# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Details of joystick reading (logic 0 when pressed), mapping of joystick bits to return values, examples of BASIC PEEK/bitwise manipulations for reading joystick and fire buttons, and conflicts between joystick and keyboard matrix scans (how keyscan interprets joystick presses as keypresses). Workarounds: use Controller Port 2 to avoid conflicts or temporarily disable keyscan with POKE 56333,127 and restore it after reads.

                          These same data ports are also used to read the joystick controllers.
                          Although common sense might lead you to believe that you could read
                          the joystick that is plugged into the port marked Controller Port 1
                          from Data Port A, and the second joystick from Data Port B, there is
                          nothing common about the Commodore 64.  Controller Port 1 is read from
                          Data Port B, and Controller Port 2 is read from CIA #1 Data Port A.

                          Joysticks consist of five switches, one each for up, down, right, and
                          left directions, and another for the fire button.  The switches are
                          read like the key switches--if the switch is pressed, the
                          corresponding bit will read 0, and if it is not pressed, the bit will
                          be set to 1.  From BASIC, you can PEEK the ports and use the AND and
                          NOT operators to mask the unused bits and inverse the logic for easier
                          comprehension.  For example, to read the joystick in Controller Port
                          1, you could use the statement:

                          S1=NOT PEEK(56321)AND15

                          The meaning of the possible numbers returned are:

                          |    |              |
                          |----|--------------|
                          |  0 | none pressed |
                          |  1 | up		 |
                          |  2 | down	 |
                          |  4 | left	 |
                          |  5 | up left	 |
                          |  6 | down left	 |
                          |  8 | right	 |
                          |  9 | up right	 |
                          | 10 | down right	 |

                          The same technique can be used for joystick 2, by substituting 56320
                          as the number to PEEK.  By the way, the 3 and 7 aren't listed because
                          they represent impossible combinations like up-down.

                          To read the fire buttons, you can PEEK the appropriate port and use
                          the AND operator to mask all but bit 4:

                              T1=(PEEK(56321)AND16)/16

                          The above will return a 0 if the button is pressed, and a 1 if it is
                          not.  Substitute location 56320 as the location to PEEK for Trigger
                          Button 2.

                          Since CIA #1 Data Port B is used for reading the keyboard as well as
                          joystick 1, some confusion can result.  The routine that checks the
                          keyboard has no way of telling whether a particular bit was set to 0
                          by a keypress or one of the joystick switches.  For example, if you
                          plug the joystick into Controller Port 1 and push the stick to the
                          right, the routine will interpret this as the 2 key being pressed,
                          because both set the same bit to 0.  Likewise, when you read the
                          joystick, it will register as being pushed to the right if the 2 key
                          is being pressed.

                          The problem of mistaking the keyboard for the joystick can be solved
                          by turning off the keyscan momentarily when reading the stick with a
                          POKE 56333, 127:POKE 56320,255, and restoring it after the read with a
                          POKE 56333,129.  Sometimes you can use the simpler solution of
                          clearing the keyboard buffer after reading the joystick, with a POKE
                          198,0.

                          The problem of mistaking the joystick for a keypress is much more
                          difficult--there is no real way to turn off the joystick.  Many
                          commercially available games just use Controller Port 2 to avoid the
                          conflict.  So, if you can't beat them, sit back and press your
                          joystick to the left in order to slow down a program listing (the
                          keyscan routine thinks that it is the CTRL key).

                          As if all of the above were not enough, Port A is also used to control
                          which set of paddles is read by the SID chip, and to read the paddle
                          fire buttons.  Since there are two paddles per joystick Controller
                          Port, and only two SID registers for reading paddle positions, there
                          has to be a method for switching the paddle read from joystick Port 1
                          to joystick Port 2.

                          When Bit 7 of Port A is set to 1 and Bit 6 is cleared to 0, the SID
                          registers will read the paddles on Port 1.  When Bit 7 is set to 0 and
                          Bit 6 is set to 1, the paddles on Port 2 are read by the SID chip
                          registers.  Note that this also conflicts with the keyscan routine,
                          which is constantly writing different values to CIA #1 Data Port A in
                          order to select the keyboard column to read (most of the time, the
                          value for the last column is written to this port, which coincides
                          with the selection of paddles on joystick Port 1).  Therefore, in
                          order to get an accurate reading, you must turn off the keyscan IRQ
                          and select which joystick port you want to read.  See POTX at 54297
                          ($D419), which is the SID register where the paddles are read, for the
                          exact technique.
