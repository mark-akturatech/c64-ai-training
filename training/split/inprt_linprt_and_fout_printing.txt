# ********* - INPRT (print 'IN' followed by a line number), LINPRT (convert and output line numbers: high byte in .A, low byte in .X converted to FP then to ASCII), and FOUT (convert contents of FAC1 to ASCII string and set pointer in .A/.Y). Covers routines that format and output numbers and line numbers to ASCII.

48576         $BDC0          INPRT
Print IN Followed by a Line Number

48589         $BDCD          LINPRT
Output a Number in ASCII Decimal Digits

This routine is used to output the line number for the routine above.
It converts thenumber whose high byte is in .A and whose low byte is
in .X to a floating point number.  It also calls the routine below,
which converts the floating point number to an ASCII string.

48605         $BDDD          FOUT
Convert Contents of FAC1 to ASCII String

This routine converts a floating point number to a string of ASCII
digits, and sets a pointer to the string in .A and .Y.
