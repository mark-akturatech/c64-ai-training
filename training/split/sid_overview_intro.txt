# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $D400-$D41C — Sound Interface Device (SID) overview: the 6581 SID provides three voices with 16-bit frequency control, waveforms, ADSR envelopes, sync/ringmod, and programmable filters (low/high/band-pass). Addresses $D400-$D41C (54272-54300) are the SID registers. Most SID registers are write-only (except final registers).

$D400-$D41C               Sound Interface Device (SID) Registers

                          Memory locations 54272-54300 ($D400-$D41C) are used to address the
                          6581 Sound Interface Device (SID).

                          SID is a custom music synthesizer and sound effects generator chip
                          that gives the 64 its impressive musical capabilities.  It provides
                          three separate music channels, or voices, as they are called.  Each
                          voice has 16-bit frequency resolution, waveform control, envelope
                          shaping, oscillator synchronization, and ring modulation.  In
                          addition, programmable high-pass, low-pass, and band-pass filters can
                          be set and enabled or disabled for each sound channel.

                          Since quite a few of these locations must be used in concert to
                          produce sound, a brief summary of the interplay between some of these
                          registers may be helpful.
