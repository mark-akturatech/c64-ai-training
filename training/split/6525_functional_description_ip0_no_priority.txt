# MACHINE - Functional description of 6525 operation when IP = 0 (No Priority). Explains that ILR contents are immediately transferred to AIR, /IRQ is asserted, reading AIR resets /IRQ and clears ILR bits via ILR xor AIR, and writing AIR clears AIR and may trigger new interrupts. Notes multiple simultaneous interrupts may be present in AIR and must be handled by software.

Functional Description
----------------------

1.  IP = 0  No Priority

All interrupt information latched into interrupt latch register (ILR) is
immediately transferred into active interrupt register (AIR) and /IRQ is
pulled low.  Upon read of interrupt the /IRQ is reset high and the
appropriate bit(s) of the interrupt latch register is cleared by exclusive
OR-ing the ILR with AIR (ILR xor AIR).  After the appropriate interrupt
request has been serviced a Write to the AIR will clear it and initiate a new
interrupt sequence if any interrupts were received during previous interrupt
servicing.  In this non-prioritized mode it is possible for two or more
interrupts to occur simultaneously and be transferred to the AIR.  If this
occurs it is a software effort to recognize this and act accordingly.
