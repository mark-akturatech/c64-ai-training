# COMMODORE 64 - REM [remark]: remark/comment statement ignored by BASIC during execution; used to document programs and appears when program is LISTed. REM can include any characters including BASIC keywords and colons. REM lines are executable targets for GOTO/GOSUB but are non-executed comments. Examples.

  REM

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: REM [<remark>]

    Action:The REM statement makes your programs more easily understood
  when LISTed. It's a reminder to yourself to tell you what you had in
  mind when you were writing each section of the program. For instance,
  you might want to remember what a variable is used for, or some other
  useful information. The REMark can be any text, word, or character
  including the colon (:) or BASIC keywords.
    The REM statement and anything following it on the same line-number
  are ignored by BASIC, but REMarks are printed exactly as entered when
  the program is listed. A REM statement can be referred to by a GOTO or
  GOSUB statement, and the execution of the program will continue with
  the next higher program line having executable statements.
