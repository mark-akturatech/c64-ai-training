# SID 6581/8580 Sound Interface Device - Programming Guide - Sawtooth waveform: linear rise then sharp drop, contains all harmonics with amplitudes proportional to 1/n, bright/brassy tone ideal for strings, brass, pads, high harmonic content.

5.2 SAWTOOTH
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Produces a ramp wave that rises linearly then drops sharply
  - Contains ALL harmonics (odd and even)
  - Harmonic amplitudes proportional to 1/n where n is the harmonic number
  - Produces a bright, buzzy, "brassy" tone
  - Richest harmonic content of the periodic waveforms
  - Excellent for brass, string, and pad sounds
