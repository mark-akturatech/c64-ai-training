# ********* - Section 2.2: How to connect the power cable and serial bus cable; cable orientation cautions; daisy-chaining multiple disk drives and printer hookup diagram (Fig 3); recommendation to power up one drive at a time and to use one drive during initial familiarization.

2.2 CONNECTION OF CABLES

Your first step is to take the power cable and insert it into the back
of the disk drive (see figure 2).  It won't go in if you try to put it
in upside down.  Once it's in the drive, plug the other end into the
electrical outlet.  If the disk drive makes any sound at this time,
please turn it off using the switch on the back!  Don't plug any other
cables into the disk drive if the power is on.

Next, take the serial bus cable and attach it to either one of the
serial bus sockets in the rear of the drive.  Turn off the computer,
and plug the other end of the cable into the back of the computer.
That's all there is to it!

If you have a printer, or any additional disk drives, attach the
cables into the second serial bus port (see figure 3).  For directions
on using multiple drives at one time, read chapter 9. If you are a
first-time user with more than one drive, start working with only one
drive until you're comfortable with the unit.
