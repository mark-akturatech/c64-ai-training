# 6502 Multiplication and Division Algorithms - Source: llx.com - Example assembly demonstrating multiplication by 10. Starts by storing NUM into RESULT, uses repeated ASL/ROL to form 2x and 4x, adds NUM to form 5x, then shifts to get 10x. Shows full sequence for two-byte values and comments on composing 8x + 2x (or 2*(4x+x)).



Or we can multiply by 10 using the fact that 10x = 8x +
2x (or, factoring out a 2, 10x = 2(4x + x)):


LDA NUM       ;Start with RESULT = NUM
        STA RESULT
        LDA NUM+1
        STA RESULT+1
        ASL RESULT
        ROL RESULT+1  ;RESULT = 2*NUM
        ASL RESULT
        ROL RESULT+1  ;RESULT = 4*NUM
        CLC
        LDA NUM
        ADC RESULT
        STA RESULT
        LDA NUM+1
        ADC RESULT+1
        STA RESULT+1  ;RESULT = 5*NUM
        ASL RESULT
        ROL RESULT+1  ;RESULT = 10*NUM
