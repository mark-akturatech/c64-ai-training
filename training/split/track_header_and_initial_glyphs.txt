# byRiclianll - Track dump header and the initial region of the sector dump showing the 'TRACK' label, assorted printable-glyph artifacts (e.g. uu<, uo, y-\y^, ■, OOi, lO.), isolated byte-offset-like annotations (18:, 4u;, 48:, 50:) and scattered 00 bytes. This chunk establishes the header and the first mixed ASCII/hex artifacts and small padding runs at the start of the track.
