# ********* - DEF: Implementation of the DEF statement (routine at $B3B3). Describes syntax checking for DEF, pushing five bytes onto the stack (first byte of the function statement, a two-byte pointer to the dependent variable descriptor for the function argument, and the address of the first character of the function definition in the program text). Notes that DEF must fit on one line but functions can be extended by nesting/calling other functions.

Perform DEF

DEF performs some syntax checking, and pushes five bytes onto the
stack:  the first byte of the function statement, a two-byte pointer
to the dependent variable (the X in FN(X)), and the address of the
first character of the definition itself, where it resides in the
program text.

The DEF statement must fit on one line, but functions can be extended
by nesting them (having one function call another).
