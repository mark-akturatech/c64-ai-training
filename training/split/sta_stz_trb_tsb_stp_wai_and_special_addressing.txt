# Kick Assembler - Covers STA (store accumulator) opcode encodings ($85, $95, ...), STZ (store zero) opcodes ($64, $74), TRB (test and reset bit) opcodes ($14, $1c), TSB (test and set bit) opcodes ($04, $0c), STP and WAI entry (stp / wai), and special addressing-mode/opcode entries (ind, rel, izp, zprel, indx) with opcodes such as $92, $db, $cb. This section corresponds to entries in the Quick Reference and includes surrounding blank lines.

- "smb_set_memory_bit_instructions" which expands on single-bit set/reset instructions (SMB/RMB) are related to TRB/TSB's byte-level bit operations
- "jmp_instruction_variants" which expands on special addressing modes like rel/ind used by control-flow instructions
