# byRiclianll - Shows a concrete example (T*) where all files beginning with a given letter are scratched and explains the behavior (no match → no scratch). Demonstrates a catastrophic example using SO:* which scratches every file on the diskette (equivalent to a short NEW) and warns to be careful.

In  the  above  example  all  files  beginning  with  the  letter  T,  regardless  of  file  type,  will 
be  scratched.  In  the  event  that  no  file  starts  with  the  letter  T,  none  will  be  affected. 
Careless  use  of  a  wild  card  can  have  catastrophic  results.  For  example: 

EXAMPLE:    OPEN   15,    B,  15 

PRINT#15,  "SO:*" 
CLOSE  15 

DOS  5.1:    >SO: * 


The  above  command  will  scratch  every  file  on  the  diskette.  It  is  the  equivalent  of  per- 
forming a  short  new  on  a  diskette.  Be  careful!
