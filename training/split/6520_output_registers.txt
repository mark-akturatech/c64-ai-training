# MACHINE - 6520 Peripheral Output Registers (ORA, ORB). Store output data for the Peripheral I/O port. Writing a 0 drives the corresponding line low (if configured as output), writing a 1 drives it high. ORA controls Peripheral A port lines; ORB controls Peripheral B port lines.

Peripheral Output Registers (ORA, ORB)
--------------------------------------

The Peripheral Output Registers store the output data which appears on the
Peripheral I/O port.  Writing a "0" into a bit in ORA causes the
corresponding line on the Peripheral A port to go low (< 0.4V) if that line
is programmed to act as an output.  A "1" causes the corresponding output to
go high.  The lines of the Peripheral B port are controlled by ORB in the
same manner.
