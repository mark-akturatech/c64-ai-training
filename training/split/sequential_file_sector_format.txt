# byRiclianll - Format of a standard sequential data block on the 1541/Commodore DOS: bytes 0 = track of next block (link), 1 = sector of next block (link), bytes 2-255 = 254 bytes of user data. For the last sector in a sequential file: byte 0 = $00 (indicates end-of-file), byte 1 = position of the last valid data byte (N); bytes beyond N are garbage.

2-N  The  last  N-2  bytes  of  the  sequential  file 

(N+l)-255  Garbage
