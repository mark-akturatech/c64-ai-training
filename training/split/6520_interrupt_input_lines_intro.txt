# MACHINE - Intro to 6520 interrupt input/peripheral control lines (CA1, CA2, CB1, CB2). These lines provide special control functions and enhance the two general-purpose I/O ports (PA0-PA7/PB0-PB7).

Interrupt Input/Peripheral Control Lines (CA1, CA2, CB1, CB2)
-------------------------------------------------------------

The four interrupt input/peripheral control lines provide a number of special
peripheral control functions.  These lines greatly enhance the power of the
two general purpose interface ports (PA0-PA7, PB0-PB7).
