# byRiclianll - Assembler directives, origin, and initial CPU/register setup. Contains .OPT directive and sets code origin (* = $0500). Initializes drive-related pointer/flag (LDA #*04; STA *31), loads and increments a pointer at *3A (LDA *3A / TAX / INX / TXA / STA *3A) performing a checksum increment, and calls the GCR conversion routines (JSR *F78F and JSR *F510) that prepare data for drive transfer.
