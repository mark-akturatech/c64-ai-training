# 6502 Microprocessor - Immediate addressing (#): operand value is encoded in the instruction. Example: LDA #$0A -> opcodes $A9 $0A.

  1) Immediate
  In this mode the operand's value is given in the instruction itself. In
  assembly language this is indicated by "#" before the operand.
  eg.  LDA #$0A - means "load the accumulator with the hex value 0A"
  In machine code different modes are indicated by different codes. So LDA
  would be translated into different codes depending on the addressing mode.
  In this mode, it is: $A9 $0A
