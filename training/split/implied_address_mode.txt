# MACHINE - Implied addressing (no memory operand): instructions like INX, BRK, TAY have no operand and occupy one byte. NOP is debated as 'no address' since it does nothing.



No Address:  Implied Mode
-------------------------

Instructions such as INX (increment X), BRK (break), and TAY (transfer A to
Y) need no address; they make no memory reference and are complete in
themselves.  Such instructions occupy one byte of memory.

We might say that such instructions have "no address."  The precise term is
"implied address," which seems to say that there is in fact an address, but
we do not need to state it.

Perhaps the word "implied" is used in this manner:  an instruction such as
INX implies the use of the address register; and an instruction such as BRK
implies the address of the machine language monitor.  If so, there's an
instruction that still defies this definition:  NOP.
