# ********* - ARYTAB ($2F-$30) pointer to the start of the BASIC array storage area (address immediately after nonarray variable storage). Format for arrays: two-byte name (same high-bit/type patterns as nonarray variables except no FN), two-byte low-byte-first offset to the next array, one-byte dimension count, then pairs of bytes holding each dimension+1 (DIM makes space for index 0). After the dimension descriptors come the array element values themselves; each element uses storage appropriate to its type (5 bytes for floating point, 2 for integer, 3 for string descriptor). Notes that actual string text for string elements is stored elsewhere (FREETOP area).

Pointer to the Start of the BASIC Array Storage Area

This location points to the address of the end of nonarray variable
storage, and the beginning of array variable storage.  The format for
array storage is as follows:

The first two bytes hold the array name.  The format and high-bit
patterns are the same as for nonarray variables (see 45 ($2D) above),
except that there is no equivalent to the function definition.

Next comes a two-byte offset to the start of the next array, low byte
first.  Then there is a one-byte value for the number of array
dimensions (e.g., 2 for a two-dimensional array like A(x,y)).  That
byte is followed by pairs of bytes which hold the value of each array
dimension+1 (DIMensioning an array always makes space for 0, so A(0)
can be used).

Finally come the values of the variables themselves.  The format for
these values is the same as with nonarray values, but each value only
takes up the space required; that is, floating point variables use
five bytes each, integers two bytes, and string descriptors three
bytes each.

Remember that as with nonarray string, the actual string text is
stored elsewhere, in the area which starts at the location pointed to
in 51-52 ($33- $34).
