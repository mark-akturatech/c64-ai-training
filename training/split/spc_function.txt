  SPC

  TYPE: String Function
  FORMAT: SPC (<numeric>)

    Action: The SPC function is used to control the formatting of data, as
  either an output to the screen or into a logical file. The number of
  SPaCes given by the <numeric> argument are printed, starting at the first
  available position. For screen or tape files the value of the argument
  is in the range of 0 to 255 and for disk files up to 254. For printer
  files, an automatic carriage-return and line-feed will be performed by
  the printer if a SPaCe is printed in the last character position of a
  line. No SPaCes are printed on the following line.
