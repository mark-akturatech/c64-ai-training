# COMMODORE 64 - Explains LINE 30: placing sprite 0 data into 63 bytes of RAM starting at location 832 (sprite occupies 832..894). Explains LINE 40: setting variable V=53248 (base address of the video chip) so code can use POKE V+offset, conserving program text and making addresses easier to remember.

    LINE 30 puts the first sprite (sprite 0) into 63 bytes of the Commodore
  64's RAM memory starting at location 832 (each sprite requires 63 bytes

  of memory). The first sprite (sprite 0) is "addressed" at memory
  locations 832 to 894.

    LINE 40 sets the variable "V" equal to 53248, the starting address of
  the VIDEO CHIP. This entry lets us use the form (V+number) for sprite
  settings. 're using the form (V+number) when POKEing sprite settings
  because this format conserves memory and lets us work with smaller
  numbers. For example, in line 50 we typed POKE V+21. This is the same as
  typing POKE 53248+21 or POKE 53269... but V+21 requires less space than
  53269, and is easier to remember.
