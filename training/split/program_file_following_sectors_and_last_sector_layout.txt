# byRiclianll - Describes subsequent sectors of a PRG file: for non-final blocks bytes 0-1 are forward pointer to next block and bytes 2-255 contain 254 bytes of program data. For the last block: byte 0 = $00 (indicates last sector), byte 1 = number of bytes to read (N), bytes 2..N-1 are valid program data, remaining bytes are garbage.

The  last  block  in  a  program  file  is  special  because: 

1.  It  is  the  last  sector. 

2.  It  is  usually  only  partially  full. 

To  signal  the  DOS  that  this  is  the  last  block,  the  first  byte  is  set  to  $00.  The  first  byte 
is  normally  the  track  link.  Since  there  is  no  track  0,  the  DOS  knows  that  this  is  the 
last  sector  in  the  file.  The  second  byte  indicates  the  position  of  the  last  byte  that  is  part 
of  the  program  file.  Any  bytes  beyond  this  position  are  garbage. 

Diagrammatically,  the  last  sector  in  a  program  file  looks  like  this:

0  Null  byte  to  indicate  that  this  is  the  last  sector 

1  Number  of  bytes  to  read  from  this  sector  (N) 

2-N      The  last  (N-2)  bytes  of  the  program 
(N  +  l)-255  Garbage
