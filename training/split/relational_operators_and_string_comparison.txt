# COMMODORE 64 - Relational operators (<, =, >, <=, >=, <>) used to compare operands; when used produce integer true/false (-1 for true, 0 for false). Examples of numeric and string comparisons; strings compared character-by-character using PET/CBM character codes; comparing mismatched types causes ?TYPE MISMATCH. Comparisons always yield integer results and can be used within expressions except as divisors.

  RELATIONAL OPERATORS

    The relational operators (<, =, >, <=, >=, <>) are primarily used
  to compare the values of two operands, but they also produce an arith-
  metic result. The relational operators and the logical operators (AND,
  OR, and NOT), when used in comparisons, actually produce an arithmetic
  true/false evaluation of an expression. If the relationship stated in
  the expression is true the result is assigned an integer value of - 1
  and if it's false a value of 0 is assigned. These are the relational
  operators:
                   <   LESS THAN
                   =   EQUAL TO
                   >   GREATER THAN
                   <=  LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO
                   >=  GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO
                   <>  NOT EQUAL TO

    EXAMPLES:

      1 =5-4          result true (-1)
      14>66           result false (0)
      15>=15          result true (-1)

    Relational operators can be used to compare strings. For comparison
  purposes, the letters of the alphabet have the order A<B<C<D, etc.
  Strings are compared by evaluating the relationship between corre-
  sponding characters from left to right (see String Operations).

    EXAMPLES:

      "A" < "B"       result true (-1)
      "X" = "YY"      result false (0)
      BB$ <> CC$

    Numeric data items can only be compared (or assigned) to other numeric
  items. The same is true when comparing strings, otherwise the BASIC error
  message ?TYPE MISMATCH will occur. Numeric operands are compared by first
  converting the values of either or both operands from integer to
  floating-point form, as necessary. Then the relationship of the floating-
  point values is evaluated to give a true/false result.
    At the end of all comparisons, you get an integer no matter what data
  type the operand is (even if both are strings). Because of this,
  a comparison of two operands can be used as an operand in performing
  calculations. The result will be - 1 or 0 and can be used as anything but
  a divisor, since division by zero is illegal.

  LOGICAL OPERATORS

    The logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) can be used to modify the meanings
  of the relational operators or to produce an arithmetic result. Logical
  operators can produce results other than -1 and 0, though any nonzero
  result is considered true when testing for a true/false condition.
    The logical operators (sometimes called Boolean operators) can also be
  used to perform logic operations on individual binary digits (bits) in
  two operands. But when you're using the NOT operator, the operation is
