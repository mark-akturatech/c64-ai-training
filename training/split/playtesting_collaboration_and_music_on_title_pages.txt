# Contents - Design tips: discuss ideas with others (brainstorming sessions) to get creative input and improve game appeal. Use brief music on title pages or short animations between levels to retain player interest; background music should be low-volume relative to sound effects and optionally player-toggleable.

Your game can usually be made more in- 
teresting if you discuss some of your ideas with 
others before you start programming. Because 
everybody sees things differently, you may be given 
some ideas that will greatly enhance the play of the 
game. Many of the large game corporations put a 
number of game designers in a room and have them 
toss ideas back and forth. A bull session such as this 
can be the fastest way to get creative input into the 
design of a video game. 



appeal of a game. If nothing else, music played 
while the title page is displayed will hold a player's 
attention as they are reading the credits, rules, or 
whatever else you may choose to put on a title page. 
In some cases, background music may be ap- 
propriate to a game. When this is done, it should 
be played at a relatively low volume with respect 
to the rest of the sound effects. Loud background 
music can be quite a distraction and a nuisance 
when it drowns out the sound effects. You may want 
to consider creating an option that will allow the 
game to be played without any background music. 
Many games provide a brief break as the player 
moves from one level of play to another. Quite often, 
during this pause, a short piece of animation is 
shown on the screen along with some music. If a 
game takes a long time to play, these breaks give 
the player a time to relax and catch his breath.
