# NMOS 6510 - Describes DCP operation: decrement the contents of memory and then compare the result with the A register. Notes that N, Z and C are set according to the compare after the decrement. Includes a short example (DCP $FF) and the equivalent legal instruction sequence (DEC $FF followed by CMP $FF). Lists test program filenames used to verify behavior.

Operation: Decrement the contents of a memory location and then compare the result with the A
register.
•

N / Z / C are set according to the compare, after the decrement

Example:
DCP $FF

;C7 FF

Equivalent Instructions:
DEC $FF
CMP $FF
