# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Concrete sprite line examples mapping bit patterns to decimal bytes: e.g., 00000000 01111110 00000000 -> 0,126,0 and 00011111 11111111 11111000 -> 21,255,248; explanation of how bit values sum to those bytes.

                          Since each line of the sprite is 24 dots wide, it takes 3 bytes of
                          memory (24 bits) per line to portray its shape.  Let's take a look at
                          a couple of sample sprite lines.

                          00000000 01111110 00000000 = 0, 126, 0

                          As you can see, the first and last bytes are all 0's, so nothing will
                          be displayed there.  The middle byte has six 1's, so it will be
                          displayed as a line six dots long.  By adding the values of these six
                          bits (64+32+16+8+4+2), we get a byte value of 126.  Let's try another
                          line.

                          00011111 11111111 11111000 = 21, 255, 248

                          The first byte has five bits set to 1, having values of 16, 8, 4, 2,
                          and 1, for a total of 31.  The second byte has all bits set to 1, so
                          it has the maximum value of 255.  The third byte also has five bits
                          set to 1, having values of 128, 64, 32, 16, and 8, for a total of 248.
                          The result is that this line of sprite data will display a line that
                          is 18 dots long.
