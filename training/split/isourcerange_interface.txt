# Kick Assembler - ISourceRange interface: represents a position in source code (e.g. line/column ranges). Plugins receive source ranges to indicate where parameters or calls originate and can return them when reporting errors. The interface is empty (marker interface).

In this section the different plugins are described. Most of them follow a simple pattern: They contain two
methods, one for returning a definition for the plugin (name, required parameters, etc. ) and one for executing it:
interface XYZPlugin extends IPlugin {
XYZDefinition getDefinition();
void execute(...);
}

The XYZDefinition class simply contains getters and setters for the definition of the plugin, so your getDefinition() method should simply return an XYZDefinition where you have set the fields using the setters
