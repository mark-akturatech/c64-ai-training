1.2  How  to  Type  in  the  Programs 

Program  listings  in  books  and  magazines  often  suffer  from  two  problems:  typographical 
errors  that  occur  when  the  program  is  retyped  into  a  word  processor  and  the  readabili- 
ty of  Commodore's  control  characters  (e.g.,  the  reverse  field  heart  that  means  Clear 
Screen),  lb  overcome  these  problems,  the  program  hstings  for  this  book  were  created 
using  a  special  "lister"  program.  This  lister  program  took  a  working  BASIC  program 
and  converted  it  into  a  WordPro™  file.  At  the  same  time,  control  characters  were  spell- 
ed out  in  words  and  surrounded  by  curly  brackets.  For  example,  a  reverse  field  heart 
was  converted  to  {CLR}.  The  table  below  summarizes  the  hsting  conventions,  the  cor- 
responding control  characters,  and  the  proper  key/keys  to  press  on  your  C64  or  VIC-20.
