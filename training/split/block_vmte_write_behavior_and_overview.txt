# byRiclianll - Explains that a block-vmte (U2) command writes the entire buffer to disk regardless of the buffer-pointer position; notes that the buffer-pointer is ignored by DOS during U2. Introduces the two example programs that follow: one to change a disk name using a block-write (U2) and one to edit the cosmetic disk ID in the BAM (not the embedded formatting ID in sector headers). Also shows the U2 command parameter synopsis.

The  entire  contents  of  a  buffer  are  written  to  disk  during  the  execution  of  a  block-vmte 
command  (U2).  The  position  of  the  buffer-pointer  is  irrelevant.  It  is  not  referred  to  by 
the  DOS  during  the  execution  of  a  block-vmte  command  (U2). 

The  first  program  listed  below  allows  a  disk  name  to  be  changed  using  a  block-write 
command  (U2).  The  second  example  allows  you  to  edit  the  cosmetic  disk  ID  that  ap- 
pears in  the  BAM.  NOTE:  This  program  does  not  change  the  formatting  ID  that  is 
embedded  in  the  header  block  of  every  sector. 


"U2:"  channel#;  drive#;  track; 
"U2:   channel #,   drive#,  track,
