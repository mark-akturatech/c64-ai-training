# ca65 Users Guide - The -t sys, --target sys option: set the target system which enables translation of character strings and constants into that system's character set. Default is 'none' (no translation). The assembler supports the same targets as the compiler. Depending on the target, the assembler may also set a default CPU type (overridable with --cpu).

-t sys, --target sys
Set the target system. This will enable translation of character strings and character constants into the character set of the target platform. The default for the target system is "none", which means that no translation will take place. The assembler supports the same target systems as the compiler, see there for a list.

Depending on the target, the default CPU type is also set. This can be overridden by using the --cpu option.
