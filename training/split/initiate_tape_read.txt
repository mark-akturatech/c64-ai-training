# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Entry point to start a tape read (load/verify): clears serial status and load/verify flags ($90,$93), calls set-pointer (JSR $F7D7), waits for PLAY (JSR $F817), exits if STOP pressed, disables interrupts (SEI), clears several tape-related state bytes ($AA,$B4,$B0,$9E,$9F,$9C), sets up CA1 interrupt enable and selects the tape read IRQ vector index (LDX #$0E) then branches (BNE) to the common tape read/write handler.
