# Analyzing C64 tape loaders - Appendix A header introducing CIA #1 register range ($DC00-$DC0F): describes CIA purpose (timers, data ports, keyboard, joysticks), interrupt line wired to 6510 IRQ, and general uses such as keyboard scanning and tape timing functions.

56320-56335 $DC00-$DC0F
Complex Interface Adapter (CIA) #1 Registers
</code>

Locations 56320-56335 ($DC00-$DC0F) are used to communicate with the Complex Interface Adapter chip #1 (CIA #1). This chip allows the 6510 microprocessor to communicate with peripheral input and output devices. The specific devices that CIA #1 reads data from and sends data to are the joystick controllers, the paddle fire buttons, and the keyboard.

In addition to its two data ports, CIA #1 has two timers, each of which can count an interval from a millionth of a second to a fifteenth of a second. Or the timers can be hooked together to count much longer intervals. CIA #1 has an interrupt line which is connected to the 6510 IRQ line. These two timers can be used to generate interrupts at specified intervals (such as the 1/60 second interrupt used for keyboard scanning, or the more complexly timed interrupts that drive the tape read and write routines).
