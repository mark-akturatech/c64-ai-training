# ********* - RIBUF ($F7-$F8) — Pointer to the RS-232 input buffer. Explains that when device #2 (RS-232) is opened two 256-byte buffers are allocated at the top of memory, and this location points to the currently used input buffer. Advises BASIC programs to OPEN device 2 before assigning variables to avoid top-of-memory clashes because OPEN performs a CLR.

Pointer: RS-232 Input Buffer

When device number 2 (the RS-232 channel) is opened, two buffers of
256 bytes each are created at the top of memory.  This location points
to the address of the one which is used to store characters as they
are received.  A BASIC program should always OPEN device 2 before
assigning any variables to avoid the consequences of overwriting
variables which were previously located at the top of memory, as BASIC
executes a CLR after opening this device.
