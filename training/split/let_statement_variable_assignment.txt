# ********* - LET ($A9A5) — Perform LET: handles creation and assignment for all variable types (strings, floating point, integers, ST, TI, TI$), including array and scalar variables. Composed of subroutines to evaluate variable LHS, evaluate RHS expression, type-check suitability, and assign or create variables.

Perform LET

The LET command causes variables to be created and initialized, or to
have a new value assigned.  It handles all types of array or nonarray
variables:  strings, floating point, integers, ST, TI, and TI$.  The
routine is composed of several subroutines that evaluate the variable,
evaluate the assigned expression, check that the assigned value is
suitable for a variable of that type, and then assign a value to the
existing variable, or create a new variable.
