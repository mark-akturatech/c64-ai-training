# Analyzing C64 tape loaders - Additional explanatory notes about Control Register A/B bits: reiterates bits 0-3 function for timers, bit 4 as force-load, bit 5 selection between CPU cycles and CNT line, and bit 7's role for TOD frequency and writing behavior.


Bits 0-3. This nybble performs the same functions for Timer B that Bits 0-3 of Control Register A perform for Timer A, except that Timer B output on Data Port B appears at Bit 7, and not Bit 6.

Bits 5 and 6. These two bits are used to select what Timer B counts. If both bits are set to 0, Timer B counts the microprocessor machine cycles (which occur at the rate of 1,022,730 cycles per second). If Bit 6 is set to 0 and Bit 5 is set to 1, Timer B counts pulses on the CNT line, which is connected to pin 4 of the User Port. If Bit 6 is set to 1 and Bit 5 is set to 0, Timer B counts Timer A underflow pulses, which is to say that it counts the number of times that Timer A counts down to 0. This is used to link the two numbers into one 32-bit timer that can count up to 70 minutes with accuracy to within 1/15 second. Finally, if both bits are set to 1, Timer B counts the number of times that Timer A counts down to 0 and there is a signal on the CNT line (pin 4 of the User Port).

Bit 7. Bit 7 controls what happens when you write to the Time of Day registers. If this bit is set to 1, writing to the TOD registers sets the ALARM time. If this bit is cleared to 0, writing to the TOD registers sets the TOD clock.
