# byRiclianll - Filename input and validation, and attempt to open the file. Prompts the user for the filename, checks filename length constraints, and (on valid input) issues an OPEN2,8,2 with the DOS 'O:' open-for-read ("O:<filename>,P,R"). Waits for the drive response (INPUT#15,EN*,EM*,ET*,ES*) and branches on error codes to appropriate handlers.
