# MACHINE - IP = 1 example A: single interrupt servicing. Step-by-step sequence when I1 occurs alone: I1 latched in ILR; /IRQ pulled low; A1 set in AIR; CPU reads AIR (which resets I1 in ILR and /IRQ); CPU services interrupt; CPU signals completion by writing AIR which clears A1.

A.  The first case is the simplest.  A single interrupt occurs and the
    processor can service it completely before another interrupt request is
    received.

    1.  Interrupt I1 is received.
    2.  Bit I1 is set high in Interrupt Latch Register.
    3.  /IRQ is pulled low.
    4.  A1 is set high.
    5.  Processor recognizes /IRQ and reads AIR to determine which interrupt
        occurred.
    6.  Bit I1 is reset and /IRQ is reset to high.
    7.  Processor services Interrupt and signals completion of Service
        routine by writing to AIR.
    8.  A1 is reset low and interrupt sequence is complete.
