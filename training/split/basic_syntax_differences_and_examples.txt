# COMMODORE 64 - Notes on Commodore 64 BASIC syntax differences and examples: explains that a second equal sign can be interpreted as a logical operator (with example), shows correct assignment example (10 C=0:B=0), explains how to separate multiple statements on one line using a colon (:), and advises rewriting MAT function usage with FOR...NEXT loops.


    Commodore 64 BASIC would interpret the second equal sign as a logical
  operator and set B = -1 if C = 0. Instead, convert this statement to:

  10 C=0:B=0

  Multiple Statements

    Some BASICs use a backslash to separate multiple statements on a line.
  With Commodore 64 BASIC, separate all statements by a colon (:).

  MAT Functions

    Programs using the MAT functions available on some BASICs must be
  rewritten using FOR...NEXT loops to execute properly.
