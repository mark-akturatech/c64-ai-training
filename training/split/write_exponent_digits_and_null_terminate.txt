# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Format and append the exponent to the output string: handle negative exponent sign (convert stored negative count to positive and place '-'), store exponent sign ('+'/'-') and the letter 'E' into the buffer, convert the exponent count to ASCII by subtracting tens repeatedly (loop that extracts tens and ones), store the two exponent digits and then a null terminator. Branching is used to exit to finalization after storing these bytes.
