# Contents - Sprite pointer format and memory: each sprite definition is 64 bytes (must start on $0040 boundary). A 16K bank holds 256 definitions so sprite pointer is one byte; when multiplied by 64 gives the start address. Sprite definitions may not be placed where VIC sees character generator ROM.



Sprite Pointers 

Once a sprite has been defined, the VIC chip 
needs to be told where to find the pattern. The sprite 
definition must be in the currently selected bank 
of memory for it to be displayed. Since each sprite 
definition takes up 64 bytes, a sprite definition will 
always start on a $0040 boundary in memory. 

A 16K bank of memory can hold 256 sprite 
definitions, so it will only require one byte to tell 
the VIC chip which sprite to display. The sprite 
pointer is a number which, when multiplied by 64, 
will give the starting address of the sprite defini- 
tion. Sprite definitions may not be placed in a sec- 
tion of memory where the VIC chip sees an image 
of the character generator ROM.
