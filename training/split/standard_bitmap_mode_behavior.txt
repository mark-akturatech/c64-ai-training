# COMMODORE 64 - Standard bit map mode (BMM = 1, MCM = 0): color is determined solely by the video matrix nybble (DB11-DB8 ignored). Each display byte (8 bits) is split into two 4-bit nybbles, permitting two independently selected colors within each 8×8 block. A display memory bit of '0' selects the lower (least significant) nybble color; a '1' selects the upper (most significant) nybble color.

  STANDARD BIT MAP MODE (BMM =1, MCM = 0)

    When standard bit map mode is in use, the color information is derived
  only from the data stored in the video matrix (the color nybble is
  disregarded). The 8 bits are divided into two 4-bit nybbles which allow
  two colors to be independently selected in each 8*8 dot block. When a bit
  in the display memory is a "0" the color of the output dot is set by the
  least significant (lower) nybble (LSN). Similarly, a display memory bit
  of "1" selects the output color determined by the MSN (upper nybble).

      BIT    |            DISPLAY COLOR
  -----------+-------------------------------------------------------------
       0     |   Lower nybble of video matrix pointer
       1     |   Upper nybble of video matrix pointer
