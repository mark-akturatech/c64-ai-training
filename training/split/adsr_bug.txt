# SID 6581/8580 Sound Interface Device - Programming Guide - Description of the SID ADSR bug: internal rate counter can delay Attack when triggered during Release due to LFSR-based rate counter. Workarounds include setting GATE=0 then GATE=1 or 'hard restart' techniques to preset envelope state before retriggering.

4.2 ADSR BUG
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SID has a well-known ADSR bug caused by the internal rate counter mechanism.
When the GATE bit is set and the envelope is in the Release phase, the Attack
phase may exhibit a brief delay before the amplitude begins to rise. This
occurs because the internal LFSR-based rate counter must complete its current
cycle before responding to the new GATE state.

Workaround: Many music players set GATE=0 followed immediately by GATE=1 in
successive frames, or use a "hard restart" technique where they pre-set the
envelope to a known state before triggering a new note.
