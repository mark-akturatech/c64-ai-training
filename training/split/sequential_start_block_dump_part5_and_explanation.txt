# byRiclianll - Final portion of the TRACK 17 - SECTOR 01 data block dump plus explanatory text: bytes 0 and 1 are the track/sector forward pointer (in this dump pointing to track 17, sector 11), the remaining 254 bytes are data (disk name, ID, file names). Notes that $0D (carriage return) is used as a delimiter between records.

Bytes  0  and  1  are  the  track  and  sector  link  (forward  pointer).  They  inform  us  that  the 
next  data  block  can  be  found  at  track  17,  sector  11.  The  remaining  254  bytes  are  data. 
The  sequential  data  that  appear  here  are  in  fact  the  disk  name  (C64  STARTER  KIT), 
the  cosmetic  disk  ID  (64),  and  the  file  names  found  on  the  C-64  DISK  BONUS  PACK. 
It  is  interesting  to  note  that  a  carriage  return  character  ($0D)  was  used  as  a  delimiter 
to  separate  record  entries.  Next  we  see:
