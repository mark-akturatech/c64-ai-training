# ca65 Users Guide - The -s, --smart-mode option (or .SMART): in 65816 mode, the assembler tracks usage of REP/SEP and updates operand sizes accordingly. If it cannot evaluate an operand (e.g., imported symbol), a warning is issued. Smart mode can't trace execution flow and can be incorrect in some cases; use .ixx and .axx to explicitly set registers. Smart mode is off by default.

-s, --smart-mode
In smart mode (enabled by -s or the .SMART pseudo instruction) the assembler will track usage of the REP and SEP instructions in 65816 mode and update the operand sizes accordingly. If the operand of such an instruction cannot be evaluated by the assembler (for example, because the operand is an imported symbol), a warning is issued.

Beware: Since the assembler cannot trace the execution flow this may lead to false results in some cases. If in doubt, use the .ixx and .axx instructions to tell the assembler about the current settings. Smart mode is off by default.
