# Kick Assembler - How to access labels of a macro execution by placing a label before the macro call; note that macros may be used before declaration; macros may call other macros or recurse provided there is a termination condition.


If you need to access the labels of a macro execution, you can do that by adding a label in front of the execution
(See the chapter on scopes and namespaces)
Notice that it is ok to use the macro before it is declared.
Macros in Kick Assembler are a little more flexible than ordinary macros. They can call other macros or even
call themselves - Just make sure there is a condition to stop the recursion so you won't get an endless loop.
