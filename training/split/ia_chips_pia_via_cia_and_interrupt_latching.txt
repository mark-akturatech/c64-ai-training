# MACHINE - Interface Adapter (IA) chips: PIA (peripheral), VIA (versatile), CIA (complex) handle event latching and interrupt control. They latch transient events into flags and can gate interrupt signals to CPU. Latching ensures brief signals are captured until software clears them; IA chips provide fine control over interrupts including enabling/disabling and flag clearing.


The IA Chips:  PIA, VIA, and CIA

The interface adapter (IA) chips are richly detailed.  To understand them
fully, you'll need to read the specifications in some detail.  Here, we'll
