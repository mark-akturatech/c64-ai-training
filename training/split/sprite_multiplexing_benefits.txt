# Contents - Sprite multiplexing explanation (brief): multiplexing tricks the C64 into displaying more sprites in the same area than the hardware nominally allows, enabling more complex animations and more moving objects in a game.

time writing the program. Many of the routines ex- 
plained in this book will enable you to write more 
complex games than you may have thought possi- 
ble. Techniques such as sprite multiplexing make 
it easy to display more sprites in the same area of 
the screen than is otherwise possible. This will give 
you more flexibility in the design of your game, 
which will make it more fun.
