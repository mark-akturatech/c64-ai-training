# MACHINE - Describes the three main device types on the memory bus: RAM (read/write program/data storage), ROM (read-only routines/OS), and IA (interface adapters: memory-mapped I/O devices like PIA/VIA/CIA/VIC/SID). Includes Figure 1.4 illustrating RAM/ROM/IA on the memory bus and an example of memory-mapped I/O ($D020 sets C64 border color). Also discusses address ranges and device decoding.



Memory Elements
---------------

There are generally three types of devices attached to the memory buses
(address, data, and control buses):

 o RAM:  Random access memory.  This is the read and write memory, where we
   will store the programs we write, along with values used by the program.
   We may store information into RAM, and may recall the information at any
   time.

 o ROM:  Read only memory.  This is where the fixed routines are kept within
   the computer.  We may not store information into ROM; its contents were
   fixed when the ROM was made.  We will use program units (subroutines)
   stored in ROM to do special tasks for us, such as input and output.

 o IA:  Interface adapter chips.  These are not memory in the usual sense;
   but, these chips are assigned addresses on the address bus, so we call
   them "memory-mapped" devices.  Information may be passed to and from these
   devices, but the information is generally not stored in the conventional
   sense.  IA chips contain such functions as:  input/output (I/O) interfaces
   that serve as connections to the "outside world"; timing devices;
   interrupt control system; and sometimes specialized functions, such as
   video control or sound generation.  IA chips come in a wide variety of
   designs, including the PIA (peripheral interface adapter), the VIA
   (versatile interface adapter), the CIA (complex interface adapter), the
   VIC (video interface chip), and the SID (sound interface device).

Within a given computer, some addresses may not be used at all.  Some devices
may respond to more than one address, so that they seem to be in two places
in memory.

An address may be thought of as split in two parts.  One part, usually the
high part of the address, selects the specific chip.  The other part of the
address selects a particular part of memory within the chip.  For example, in
the Commodore 64, the hex address $D020 (decimal 53280) sets the border color
of the video screen.  The first part of the address (roughly, $D0...) selects
the video chip; the last part of the address (...20) selects the part of the
chip that controls the border color.
