# MACHINE - 6520 Peripheral B control lines CB1 and CB2. CB1 operates as interrupt input like CA1 (sets CRB bit 7 on selected active transition). CB2 input mode mirrors CA2 input mode; CB2 output modes behave differently: CB2 pulse output occurs when processor writes to Peripheral B Output Register and 'handshaking' operates on transfers from CPU to peripheral.

Peripheral B Interrupt Input/Peripheral Control Lines (CB1, CB2)
----------------------------------------------------------------

CB1 operates as an interrupt input only in the same manner as CA1.  Bit 7 of
CRB is set by the active transition selected by bit 0 of CRB.  Likewise, the
CB2 input mode operates exactly the same as the CA2 input modes.  The CB2
output modes, CRB, bit 5=1, differ somewhat from those of CA2.  The pulse
output occurs when the processor writes data into the Peripheral B Output
Register.  Also, the "handshaking" operates on data transfers from the
processor into the peripheral device.
