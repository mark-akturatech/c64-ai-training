# COMMODORE 64 - [STEP <expression>] in FOR statement: defines increment (STEP) for the loop. Default is +1. Any value allowed (STEP 0 loops forever). STEP value cannot be changed once in loop. Examples showing positive and negative STEP values and iteration counts.

  STEP

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: [STEP <expression>]

    Action: The optional STEP keyword follows the <end-value> expression in
  a FOR statement. It defines an increment value for the loop counter
  variable. Any value can be used as the STEP increment. Of course, a STEP
  value of zero will loop forever. If the STEP keyword is left out, the
  increment value will be + 1. When the NEXT statement in a FOR loop is
  reached, the STEP increment happens. Then the counter is tested against
  the end-value to see if the loop is finished. (See FOR statement for more
  information.)

  EXAMPLES of STEP Statement:

    25 FOR XX=2 TO 20 STEP 2             (Loop repeats 10 times)
    35 FOR ZZ=0 TO -20 STEP -2           (Loop repeats 11 times)
