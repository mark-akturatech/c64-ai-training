# COMMODORE 64 - Standard (hi-res) bitmap mode provides 320x200 resolution with 2 colors per 8x8 cell. Bitmap mode is enabled by setting bit 5 of VIC-II control register at 53265 ($D011): POKE 53265,PEEK(53265)OR 32; disable with POKE 53265,PEEK(53265)AND 223. Also discusses selecting the bitmap area (BASE).


  8K section of memory on the TV screen. When in bit map mode, you can
  directly control whether an individual dot on the screen is on or off.
    There are two types of bit mapping available on the Commodore 64.
  They are:

    1) Standard (high-resolution) bit mapped mode (320-dot by 200-dot
       resolution)

    2) Multi-color bit mapped mode (160-dot by 200-dot resolution)

    Each is very similar to the character type it is named for: standard
  has greater resolution, but fewer color selections. On the other hand,
  multi-color bit mapping trades horizontal resolution for a greater number
  of colors in an 8-dot by 8-dot square.

  STANDARD HIGH-RESOLUTION BIT MAP MODE

    Standard bit map mode gives you a 320 horizontal dot by 200 vertical
  dot resolution, with a choice of 2 colors in each 8-dot by 8-dot section.
  Bit map mode is selected (turned ON) by setting bit 5 of the VIC-II
  control register to a 1 at location 53265 ($D011 in HEX). The following
  POKE will do this:

    POKE 53265,PEEK(53265)OR 32

    Bit map mode is turned OFF by setting bit 5 of the VIC-II control
  register to 0 at location 53265 ($D011), like this:

    POKE 53265,PEEK(53265)AND 223
