# ********* - RAM area 679-767 ($2A7-$2FF) marked Unused. Recommended for programmers to use for machine language subroutines or graphics data. Notes on suitability for sprite/character data when VIC-II uses bottom 16K (default). Also mentions locations 704-767 suitable for sprite data block #11.

679-767       $2A7-$2FF
Unused

The programmer may use this area for machine language subroutines, or
for graphics data storage.

If the VIC-II ship is using the bottom 16K for graphics and memory
(the default setting when the system is turned on), this is one of the
few free areas available for storing sprite or character data.
Locaitons 704-767 could be used for sprite data block number 11,
without interfering with BASIC program text or variables.
