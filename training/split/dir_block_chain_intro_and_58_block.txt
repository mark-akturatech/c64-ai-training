Contains the preamble bytes and the first visible block header '58:' (line 4628) with the bytes and ASCII fragments that follow. Illustrates how a DOS block header appears in the dump and introduces the pattern of forward pointers and embedded C64 BASIC/tokenized data that makes much of the content non-human-readable.
