# Architecture of 6502 Microprocessor - Stack Pointer (S), an 8-bit register holding the low byte of the next free stack location. The 6502 stack occupies $0100–$01FF (page 1), starts at $01FF and grows downward. Pushing decrements S; popping increments S. The hardware does not check for stack overflow — the programmer must manage stack usage.


Stack Pointer		8 bits		S

The 6502 uses a 256 byte stack located on page 1 ($0100 to $01FF).  The stack pointer is an 8 bit register that holds the least significant byte of the next free location on the stack.  This means that the stack cannot be moved.  The stack starts at $01FF and grows downward.  When a byte is pushed onto the stack, the stack pointer is decremented.  When something is popped off the stack, it is incremented.

The hardware does not detect stack overflow.  The programmer must ensure that the program does not make excessive demands on the stack space.
