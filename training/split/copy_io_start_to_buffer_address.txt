# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Small helper that copies the I/O start address into the buffer address registers. Loads I/O start address high/low bytes from $C2/$C1 and stores them into buffer address high/low $AD/$AC respectively. Used by the store/verify and checksum routines to set the buffer pointer.

                                *** copy I/O start address to buffer address
.,FB8E A5 C2    LDA $C2         get I/O start address high byte
.,FB90 85 AD    STA $AD         set buffer address high byte
.,FB92 A5 C1    LDA $C1         get I/O start address low byte
