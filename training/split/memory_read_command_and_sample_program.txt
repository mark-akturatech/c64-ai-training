# ********* - Section 8.2: MEMORY-READ syntax (PRINT#file#,"M-R" CHR$(low byte) CHR$(high byte)) to read bytes from the disk controller's RAM/ROM/buffers via the error channel; the next GET#/INPUT# on channel 15 will return bytes from that address; includes a sample BASIC program (RDISKMEM.PRG) to read memory ranges.



8.2 MEMORY-READ

There is 16K of ROM in the disk drive as well as 2K of RAM.  You can
get direct access to these, or to the buffers that the DOS has set up
in the RAM, by using the MEMORY commands.  MEMORY-READ allows you to
select which byte to read, through the error channel.

FORMAT FOR MEMORY-READ:

    PRINT#file#, "M-R" CHR$(low byte of address) CHR$(high byte)
    (no abbreviation!)

The next byte read using the GET# statement through channel# 15, the
error channel, will be from that address in the disk controller's
memory, and successive bytes will be from successive memory locations.

Any INPUT# to the error channel will give peculiar results when you're
using this command.  This can be cleared up by any other command to
the disk (aside from a memory command).

PROGRAM TO READ THE DISK CONTROLLER'S MEMORY:

start tok64 rdiskmem.prg
 10 open 15,8,15
 20 input "location please";a
 25 for l=1 to 50
 30 a1=int(a/256):a2=a-a1*256
 40 print#15,"m-r" chr$(a2)chr$(a1)
 50 get#15,a$: rem get chars from error channel
 60 print asc(a$+chr$(0))
 70 a=a+1
 80 next
 90 input "continue";a$
 100 if left$(a$,1)="y" then 25
 110 goto 20
stop tok64
