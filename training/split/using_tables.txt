# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Use lookup tables (e.g., precomputed sine tables) to avoid expensive runtime computations; tables trade memory for speed and are commonly used for effects like sine-based motion and precomputed shifts.

Using Tables
Why do people use pre-calculated sine tables? Because that means they don't have to do the costly sine calculations in real-time. That shouldn't be news to you. But if you think about it for a while, you might realize that you can use tables for lots of stuff. Generally, if you have some kind of complex calculation, you can use lookup tables somewhere. If you're writing complex stuff with lots of shifts here and there, you can probably re-write that code to run in half the time by using a table.
