# Contents - Extended background color mode: trade character-set size (only first 64 characters usable) for additional per-character background colors. The two most significant bits of the character code select background color from BCOL0..BCOL3. Enable by setting bit 6 of YSCRL ($D011); disable by clearing bit 6. Mapping: 00=BCOL0, 01=BCOL1, 10=BCOL2, 11=BCOL3.


EXTENDED BACKGROUND COLOR MODE 

In certain applications where you do not need 
a very large character set (less than 65 characters), 
you can use more colors than the standard text mode 
will allow by using the extended background color 
mode. In this mode, you do not sacrifice any resolu- 
tion to gain extra colors; you only sacrifice the 
number of characters available from your character 
set. You can control both the foreground color (us- 
ing the color RAM) and the background color of 
each character. The two most significant bits of the 
character code are used to select a background col- 
or from one of four registers, BCOL0 to BCOL3. 
Because of this, only the first 64 characters from 
your character set can be used. 

The extended background color mode is ena- 
bled by setting bit 6 of the YSCRL flfDOll) register. 
This mode can be turned off by clearing bit 6 of the 
YSCRL register. The following chart shows the rela- 
tionship between the most significant two bits of the 
character code and the background color:

01 BCOL1 

10 BCOL2 

11 BCOL3
