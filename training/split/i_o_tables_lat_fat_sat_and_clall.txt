# ********* - Tables for File Numbers, Device Numbers, and Secondary Addresses (locations 601-630 / $259-$276). Layout and purpose of the three 10-byte tables (LAT at $259-$262 for logical file numbers, FAT at $263-$26C for device numbers, SAT at $26D-$276 for secondary addresses). How entries are added on OPEN (appended) and removed on CLOSE (tables compacted), increment/decrement of location 152 ($98) indicating active I/O files, and the Kernal CLALL routine effect (zeroing location 152 to empty tables).

Location Range: 601-630 ($259-$276)
Tables for File Numbers, Device Numbers, and Secondary Addresses

All three of the tables here have room for ten one-byte entries, each
of which represents an active Input/Output file.  When an I/O file is
opened, its logical file number is put into the table at 601 ($259),
the device number of the I/O device is put into the table at 611
($263), and its secondary address is put into the table at 621 ($26D).

The entry for any particular I/O file will occupy the same position in
each of the three tables.  That is, if logical file number 2 is the
third entry in the file number table, its secondary address will be
the third entry in the secondary address table, and its corresponding
device number will occupy the third spot in the device number table.

Every time a device is OPENed, its information is added as the last
entry in each table, and the value at location 152 ($98) is increased
by one, indicating that there is one more active I/O file.  When a
device is CLOSEd, the value at location 152 is decreased by one, and
all entries that occupy a position in the tables that is higher than
that of the closed device are moved down one position, thus
eliminating the entry for that device.  The Kernal CLALL routine
(62255, $F32F) simply zeros location 152, which has the effect of
emptying these tables.
