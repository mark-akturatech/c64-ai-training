# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Prepare the RS-232 transmit machinery: read the RS-232 interrupt-enable byte ($02A1), shift it to carry and branch if interrupts are already enabled (no further action). Otherwise load A with the Timer A start mask (LDA #$10) to start the Timer A-based bit-bang transmit timing (next instructions beyond this chunk perform the start).

                                *** setup for RS232 transmit
.,F028 AD A1 02 LDA $02A1       get the RS-232 interrupt enable byte
.,F02B 4A       LSR             shift the enable bit to Cb
.,F02C B0 1E    BCS $F04C       if interrupts are enabled just exit
.,F02E A9 10    LDA #$10        start timer A
