# C64 KERNAL API (Lee Davison) - $FFC6 — Open channel for input. Marks an already-open logical file as the input channel; device must be input-capable or error occurs. If not used, keyboard is default input. For serial devices this will send LISTEN and any secondary address automatically. Possible error codes: 3=file not open, 5=device not present, 6=file is not an input file.

$FFC6          open channel for input
               
               Any logical file that has already been opened by the OPEN routine, $FFC0, can be
               defined as an input channel by this routine. the device on the channel must be an
               input device or an error will occur and the routine will abort.
               
               If you are getting data from anywhere other than the keyboard, this routine must be
               called before using either the CHRIN routine, $FFCF, or the GETIN routine,
               $FFE4. if you are getting data from the keyboard and no other input channels are
               open then the calls to this routine and to the OPEN routine, $FFC0, are not needed.
               
               When used with a device on the serial bus this routine will automatically send the
               listen address specified by the OPEN routine, $FFC0, and any secondary address.
               
               Possible errors are:
               
               * 3 : file not open
               * 5 : device not present
               * 6 : file is not an input file
