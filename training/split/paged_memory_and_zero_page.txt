# Architecture of 6502 Microprocessor - Memory is organized as 256-byte pages. The first page ($0000–$00FF) is the Zero Page and supports a special addressing mode that yields shorter, faster instructions, making it suitable for frequently accessed tables and addresses.

Paged Memory

Memory is viewed as a set of 256 byte pages.

The first page ($0000 to $00FF) is called the ‘Zero page’, and can be accessed by using a special addressing mode which enables you to use shorter and therefore faster executing instructions.

This makes it useful for storing tables of values or addresses that are going to be accessed frequently by your program.
