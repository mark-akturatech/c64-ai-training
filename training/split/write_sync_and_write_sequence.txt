# byRiclianll - Assembly-level write sequence: calls JSR $FDA3 (write sync marks), enables disk controller write mode, loads a non-sync byte (LDA #$55) and stores it to the disk data register (STA $1C01), sets X (#$FF) and Y (#$48), then calls JSR $FDC9 (WRTNUM) to perform the block write. Includes inline comments explaining each step (e.g. 'ENABLE WRITE', 'NON SYNC BYTE', 'WRITE 18432 ...').
