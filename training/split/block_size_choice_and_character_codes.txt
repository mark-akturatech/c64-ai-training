# Multidirectional Scrolling Techniques by Cadaver - Discussion of block size choice: author prefers 4x4 blocks (power-of-two sizes recommended for easy calculations). Block data usually 8-bit values representing character/screen codes used for display.

I prefer 4x4 blocks: the block size is always a tradeoff between memory use and
the complexity of graphics that can be achieved. But for easy calculations, the
block size should be a power of two. The block data consists usually of 8-bit
values too, that are the characters (screen codes) used to display the block on
screen.
