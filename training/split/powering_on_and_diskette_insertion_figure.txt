2.3 POWERING ON

When you have all the devices hooked together, it's time to start
turning on the power.  It is important that you turn on the devices in
the correct order.  The computer should always be turned on last.  As
long as the computer is the last one to be turned on, everything will
be OK.

First, make sure that you've removed all diskettes from the disk
drives before powering on.

After all the other devices have been turned on, only then is it safe
to turn on the computer.  All the other devices will go through their
starting sequences.  The printer's motor goes on, with the print head
moving halfway across the line and back again.  The 1541 disk drive
will have its green light on, and then the red drive/error light will
blink, while your TV screen forms the starting picture.

Once the red drive/error light has stopped flashing on the drive, it
is safe to begin working with it.
