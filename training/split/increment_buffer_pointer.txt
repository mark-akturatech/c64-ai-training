# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL ROM Disassembly (English, "CBM") - Small utility: calls an external JSR (ZZZ/JTP20), increments the buffer pointer (BUFPT) and returns. Contains the .LIB TAPECONTROL directive and a short sequence that updates BUFPT and returns (INC $A6 / LDY $A6 / CPY #BUFSZ / RTS).
