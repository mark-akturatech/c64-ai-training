# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Higher-level optimization: change data or algorithm to enable faster routines; sometimes reformatting data allows simpler and faster code.

Other Ways to Make Code Faster
There's of course a lot in truth in the rule that you should first optimize your algorithms, and then the constant factors. Don't think that there's no better way of achieving an effect than to use brute force. You can always cheat in some smart way, use data that makes the job easier and the code run in half the time.
