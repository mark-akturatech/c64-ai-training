# ********* - DATPTR ($41-$42) is a pointer to the address within BASIC program text where DATA is currently being READ. RESTORE sets it to the program start pointer. Includes a sample BASIC program showing how to save and poke bytes into DATPTR to change the order DATA statements are READ (demonstrates reading DATA in arbitrary order by saving TXTPTR-like bytes into variables and poking them back into DATPTR before READ).

65-66         $41-$42        DATPTR
Pointer to the Address of the Current DATA Item

This location points to the address (not the line number) within the
BASIC program text area where DATA is currently being READ.  RESTORE
sets this pointer back to the address indicated by the start of BASIC
pointer at location 43 ($2B).

The sample program below shows how the order in which DATA statements
are READ can be changed using this pointer.  The current address of
the statement before the DATA statement is stored in a variable, and
then used to change this pointer.

10 A1=PEEK(61):A2=PEEK(62)
20 DATA THIS DATA WILL BE USED SECOND
30 B1=PEEK(61):B2=PEEK(62)
40 DATA THIS DATA WILL BE USED FIRST
50 C1=PEEK(61):C2=PEEK(62)
60 DATA THIS DATA WILL BE USED THIRD
70 POKE 65,B1:POKE 66,B2:READ A$:PRINT A$
80 POKE 65,A1:POKE 66,A2:READ A$:PRINT A$
90 POKE 65,C1:POKE 66,C2:READ A$:PRINT A$

- "datlin_current_data_line_number" which expands on DATLIN provides the DATA line number used in error reporting when DATPTR points to DATA content
- "inpptr_input_source_pointer_for_get_read_input" which expands on INPPTR is similar in that it points to the source of input (DATA statements or input buffer)
