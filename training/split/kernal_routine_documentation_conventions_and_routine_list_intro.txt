# COMMODORE 64 - Documentation conventions for KERNAL routines: entries include FUNCTION NAME, CALL ADDRESS (hex), COMMUNICATION REGISTERS, PREPARATORY ROUTINES, ERROR RETURNS (carry set and accumulator contains error number), STACK REQUIREMENTS, REGISTERS AFFECTED, and DESCRIPTION. Ends with a lead-in sentence: 'The list of the KERNAL routines follows.'

    The following conventions are used in describing the KERNAL routines:


  - FUNCTION NAME: Name of the KERNAL routine.

  - CALL ADDRESS: This is the call address of the KERNAL routine, given in
    hexadecimal.

  - COMMUNICATION REGISTERS: Registers listed under this heading are used
    to pass parameters to and from the KERNAL routines.

  - PREPARATORY ROUTINES: Certain KERNAL routines require that data be set
    up before they can operate. The routines needed are listed here.

  - ERROR RETURNS: A return from a KERNAL routine with the CARRY set
    indicates that an error was encountered in processing. The accumulator
    will contain the number of the error.

  - STACK REQUIREMENTS: This is the actual number of stack bytes used by
    the KERNAL routine.

  - REGISTERS AFFECTED: All registers used by the KERNAL routine are listed
    here.

  - DESCRIPTION: A short tutorial on the function of the KERNAL routine is
    given here.
