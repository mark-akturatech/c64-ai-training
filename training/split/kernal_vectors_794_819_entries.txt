# ********* - Kernal vector entries (794-819 / $31A-$333) and short descriptions: IOPEN (794) OPEN, ICLOSE (796) CLOSE, ICHKIN (798) CHKIN, ICKOUT (800) CKOUT, ICLRCH (802) CLRCHN, IBASIN (804) CHRIN, IBSOUT (806) CHROUT, ISTOP (808) STOP (with notes on disabling STOP via POKE 808,239 etc), IGETIN (810) GETIN, ICLALL (812) CLALL, USRCMD (814) user-defined command vector (historical PET holdover), ILOAD (816) LOAD, ISAVE (818) SAVE. Each entry points to a Kernal routine address and can be modified.

794-795       $31A-$31B      IOPEN
Vector to Kernal OPEN Routine (Currently at 62282 ($F34A))

796-797       $31C-$31D      ICLOSE
Vector to Kernal CLOSE Routine (Currently at 62097 ($F291))

798-799       $31E-$31F      ICHKIN
Vector to Kernal CHKIN Routine (Currently at 61966 ($F20E))

800-801       $320-$321      ICKOUT
Vector to Kernal CKOUT Routine (Currently at 62032 ($F250))

802-803       $322-$323      ICLRCH
Vector to Kernal CLRCHN Routine (Currently at 62259 ($F333))

804-805       $324-$325      IBASIN
Vector to Kernal CHRIN Routine (Currently at 61783 ($F157))

806-807       $326-$327      IBSOUT
Vector to Kernal CHROUT Routine (Currently at 61898 ($F1CA))

808-809       $328-$329      ISTOP
Vector to Kernal STOP Routine (Currently at 63213 ($F6ED))

This vector points to the address of the routine that tests the STOP
key.  The STOP key can be disabled by changing this with a POKE
808,239.  This will not disable the STOP/RESTORE combination, however.
To disable both STOP and STOP/ RESTORE, POKE 808,234 (POKEing 234 here
will cause the LIST command not to function properly).  To bring
things back to normal in either case, POKE 808, 237.

810-811       $32A-$32B      IGETIN
Vector to Kernal GETIN Routine (Currently at 61758 ($F13E))

812-813       $32C-$32D      ICLALL
Vector to Kernal CLALL Routine (Currently at 62255 ($F32F))

814-815       $32E-$32F      USRCMD
Vector to User-Defined Command (Currently Points to BRK at 65126
($FE66))

This appears to be a holdover from PET days, when the built-in machine
language monitor would JuMP through the USRCMD vector when it
encountered a command that it did not understand, allowing the user to
add new commands to the monitor.

Although this vector is initialized to point to the routine called by
STOP/ RESTORE and the BRK interrupt, and is updated by the Kernal
VECTOR routine (64794, $FD1A), it does not seem to have the function
of aiding in the addition of new commands.

816-817       $330-$331      ILOAD
Vector to Kernal LOAD Routine (Currently at 62622 ($F49E))

818-819       $332-$333      ISAVE
Vector: Kernal SAVE Routine (Currently at 62941 ($F5DD))
