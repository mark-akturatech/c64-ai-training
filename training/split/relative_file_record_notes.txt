# byRiclianll - Explanation of record number usage in relative files: record 2 is used for management info (record length); blank fields stored as period (0x2E = '.'); record 3 begins at byte 48 and contains the first data (field labels shown).

Record  number  2  is  used  again  for  management  information  by  our  data  base.  It  simply 
contains  the  record  length.  One  can  see  from  the  number  of  carriage  returns  ($0D)  that 
while  only  6  fields  are  in  use,  21  were  established  by  the  main  program.  One  can  also 
see  that  a  blank  field  from  this  data  base  is  stored  as  a  period  ($2E  =  CHR$(46)  =  "."). 
Record  number  3  begins  at  byte  48.  It  contains  our  first  actual  data.  It  would  look  like  so:

Just  out  of  curiosity  let's  examine  the  last  two  sectors  of  our  sequential  file  chain  as 
reported  in  bytes  156-159  of  side  sector  3.  Why  two  sectors?  Our  fixed  length  of  150 
bytes  dictates  this.  (A  fixed  record  length  of  1,  2,  127,  or  254  would  not  span  a  given 
sector.  The  maximum  length  of  a  relative  record  is  254  bytes.  254  is  the  only  number 
evenly  divisible  by  these  factors.  A  record  length  of  1  or  2  would  be  rather  impractical.)
