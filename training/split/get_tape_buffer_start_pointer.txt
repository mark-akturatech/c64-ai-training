# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Helper routine that loads the tape buffer start pointer into X (low) and Y (high). Compares the high byte with #$02 (typical RAM area check). Returns with X/Y containing the pointer.

Additional information can be found by searching:
- "set_tape_buffer_start_and_end_pointers" which expands on caller that uses the pointer in X/Y to set I/O and end pointers
- "create_tape_header_and_initiate_write" which expands on higher-level routine that invokes the set-pointer routine which itself calls this helper
