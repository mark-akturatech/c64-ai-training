# Contents - Memory control lines and mapping: five control lines select primary memory maps; three bits at $0001 (the 6510 I/O port) control map selection and whether I/O or character ROM is visible at $D000-$DFFF. Explanation that bits 0 and 1 select four primary maps; bit 2 selects between I/O devices or character generator ROM at $D000-$DFFF. Figures referenced for memory maps and note that BANK macro can be used to set VIC bank.



switching of the different memory areas. Three of 
these lines are controlled by the microprocessor us- 
ing its internal I/O port. 

The three internal control lines are the least 
significant three bits at address $000 1 . This is the 
hardware I/O port of the 6510 processor. Data can 
be written to this port just as it can be written to 
any other memory location. Bits and 1 are used 
to select from the four primary memory maps that 
are available. Bit 2 selects whether the I/O devices 
or the character generator ROM will be addressable 
by the microprocessor in the range of addresses 
from $D000 to $DFFF. Bit 2 has no effect on the 
system when the memory map with 64K of RAM 
accessible is selected. The remaining two control 
lines are internally pulled high when there is no car- 
tridge plugged into the computer and can be ignored 
for a disk based program. 

Figure 7- 1 shows all of the memory mapping 
possibilities.
