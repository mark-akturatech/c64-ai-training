# ********* - Describes zero page location 0 ($00): the 6510 On-Chip I/O Data Direction Register (D6510). Lists each bit's meaning (Bits 0-5 significant; Bit 4 default input for cassette switch), default power-up value ($EF / 239), and explains that each bit sets the direction (input=0, output=1) for the corresponding bit on the internal I/O port at $01. Notes these are hardware-connected registers whose writes/reads affect devices.

6510 On-Chip I/O DATA Direction Register

Bit 0: Direction of Bit 0 I/O on port at next address.  Default = 1 (output)
Bit 1: Direction of Bit 1 I/O on port at next address.  Default = 1 (output)
Bit 2: Direction of Bit 2 I/O on port at next address.  Default = 1 (output)
Bit 3: Direction of Bit 3 I/O on port at next address.  Default = 1 (output)
Bit 4: Direction of Bit 4 I/O on port at next address.  Default = 0 (input)
Bit 5: Direction of Bit 5 I/O on port at next address.  Default = 1 (output)
Bit 6: Direction of Bit 6 I/O on port at next address.  Not used.
Bit 7: Direction of Bit 7 I/O on port at next address.  Not used.

This location is the first of a number of hardware registers that we
will discuss.  Although they can be written to and/or read like RAM,
they are connected to hardware devices, and their contents affect the
operation of the devices.

Each bit of this Data Direction Register determines whether the
contents of the corresponding bit on the Internal I/O Port (see
location 1) can be written to by peripheral devices.  If the bit is
set to 0, it indicates the direction of data flow as Input, which
means that the corresponding bit of the I/O port will be affected by
peripheral defices.  If the bit is set to 1, it indicates Output.  On
the 64, only Bits 0-5 are significant.  On power-up, this register is
set to 239 ($EF), which indicates that all bits, except for Bit 4
(which senses the cassette switch), are set up for Output.
