# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - The shifted keyboard decode table. Same matrix format as the unshifted table: ASCII (and CBM) codes given by row (written to $DC00) and column (read from $DC01). Contains shifted-character values and a trailing free byte ($FF).

                                *** KEYBOARD 2 - SHIFTED
                                This is the second of four keyboard decode tables. The
                                ASCII code for the key pressed is at the intersection of
                                the row (written to $dc00) and the column (read from
                                $dc01). The matrix values are shown below.
