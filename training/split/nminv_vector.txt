# - C64 RAM Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $0318-$0319 NMINV: vector to the Non-Maskable Interrupt routine (typically at $FE47 / 65095). Two sources: RESTORE key (direct to 6510 NMI) and CIA #2 interrupt. ROM sets Interrupt Disable flag and jumps through this RAM vector; routine checks cause (CIA #2 vs RESTORE). If CIA #2, RS-232 routines may be called; if RESTORE, cartridge warm start or STOP key tests occur; STOP+RESTORE triggers Kernal init and BASIC warm start. Notes: changing vector can disable STOP/RESTORE sequence (e.g., POKE 792,193 to point to RTI) but will also cut out NMIs needed for RS-232.

$0318-$0319  NMINV   Vector: Non-Maskable Interrupt
                     
                     This vector points to the address of the routine that will be executed
                     when a Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI) occurs (currently at 65095
                     ($FE47)).
                     
                     There are two possible sources for an NMI interrupt.  The first is the
                     RESTORE key, which is connected directly to the 6510 NMI line.  The
                     second is CIA #2, the interrupt line of which is connected to the 6510
                     NMI line.
                     
                     When an NMI interrupt occurs, a ROM routine sets the Interrupt disable
                     flag, and then jumps through this RAM vector.  The default vector
                     points to an interrupt routine which checks to see what the cause of
                     the NMI was.
                     
                     If the cause was CIA #2, the routine checks to see if one of the
                     RS-232 routines should be called.  If the source was the RESTORE key,
                     it checks for a cartridge, and if present, the cartridge is entered at
                     the warm start entry point.  If there is no cartridge, the STOP key is
                     tested.  If the STOP key was pressed at the same time as the RESTORE
                     key, several of the Kernal initialization routines such as RESTOR,
                     IOINIT and part of CINT are executed, and BASIC is entered through its
                     warm start vector at 40962.  If the STOP key was not pressed
                     simultaneously with the RESTORE, the interrupt will end without
                     letting the user know that anything happened at all when the RESTORE
                     key was pressed.
                     
                     Since this vector controls the outcome of pressing the RESTORE key, it
                     can be used to disable the STOP/RESTORE sequence.  A simple way to do
                     this is to change this vector to point to the RTI instruction.  A
                     simple POKE 792,193 will accomplish this.  To set the vector back,
                     POKE 792,71.  Note that this will cut out all NMIs, including those
                     required for RS-232 I/O.
