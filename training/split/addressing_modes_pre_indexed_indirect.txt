# 6502 Microprocessor - Pre-indexed indirect: LDA (zp,X) — add zero-page address to X (wrap-around), get two bytes at that zero-page address to form effective 16-bit address, then load. Example step-by-step given. Note: wrap-around behavior on zero-page addition and only X is used.

  9) Pre-indexed indirect
  In this mode a zer0-page address is added to the contents of the X-register
  to give the address of the bytes holding the address of the operand. The
  indirection is indicated by parenthesis in assembly language.
  eg.  LDA ($3E, X)
       $A1 $3E
  Assume the following -        byte      value
                                X-reg.    $05
                                $0043     $15
                                $0044     $24
                                $2415     $6E

  Then the instruction is executed by:
  (i)   adding $3E and $05 = $0043
  (ii)  getting address contained in bytes $0043, $0044 = $2415
  (iii) loading contents of $2415 - i.e. $6E - into accumulator

  Note a) When adding the 1-byte address and the X-register, wrap around
          addition is used - i.e. the sum is always a zero-page address.
          eg. FF + 2 = 0001 not 0101 as you might expect.
          DON'T FORGET THIS WHEN EMULATING THIS MODE.
       b) Only the X register is used in this mode.
