# byRiclianll - Error-source commentary for the duplicate-single-sector example: describes that no additional error sources were found, points out that line 320 reads the data-block identifier from the master, lines 460-490 duplicate the error on the clone, and line 500 restores state. A brief diagnostic explanation associated with the previous duplication routine.


DUPLICATE  A  SINGLE  SECTOR  22  ERROR  SOURCE  LISTING 

None.  Line  320  in  the  program  reads  the  data  block  identifier  from  the  master.  Lines 
460-490  duplicate  the  error  on  the  clone.  Line  500  puts  our  house  back  in  order.
