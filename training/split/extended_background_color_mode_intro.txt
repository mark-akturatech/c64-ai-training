# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Extended Background Color Mode (Bit 6 of $D011 / 53265): behavior where foreground color comes from Color RAM and background depends on character code groups (0-63 uses BGCOL0, 64-127 uses BGCOL1, 128-191 uses BGCOL2, 192-255 uses BGCOL3). Limits: only first 64 character shapes available.


                          The other text mode is called Extended Background Color Mode.  In this
                          mode, the foreground color is always selected by the Color RAM.  The
                          background color depends on the actual screen code of the character.
                          In this mode, only the first 64 character shapes are available, but
                          each can have one of four different background colors.

                          The background color for each character is determined by its screen
                          code as follows:

                          1.  If the screen code is from 0-63 (this includes the normal
                          alphanumerics), the value in Background Color Register 0 (53281,
                          $D021) will determine the background color, as is usual.

                          2.  Characters with codes 64-255 will have the same shape as the
                          corresponding character in the group with codes 0-63.

                          3.  For characters with codes 64-127 (SHIFTed characters), the
                          background colors are determined by the value in Background Color
                          Register 1 (53282, $D022).

                          4.  The value in Background Color Register 2 (53283, $D023) is used
                          for characters with codes 128-191 (reversed alphanumerics).

                          5.  For characters with codes 192-255, the value in Background Color
                          Register 3 (53284, $D024) is used to determine the background color.
