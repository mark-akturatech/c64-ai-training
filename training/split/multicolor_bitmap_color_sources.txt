# COMMODORE 64 - Describes how 2-bit values in multicolor bitmap map to color sources: 00 -> Background color #0, 01 -> upper 4 bits of screen memory, 10 -> lower 4 bits of screen memory, 11 -> color nybble (4-bit value).


    Multi-color bit mapped mode is turned OFF by setting bit 5 of 53265
  ($D011) and bit 4 at location 53270 ($D016) to a 0. The following POKE
  does this:

    POKE 53265,PEEK(53265)AND 223: POKE 53270,PEEK(53270)AND 239


    As in standard (HI-RES) bit mapped mode, there is a one to one cor-
  respondence between the 8K section of memory being used for the display,
  and what is shown on the screen. However, the horizontal dots are two
  bits wide. Each 2 bits in the display memory area form a dot, which can
  have one of 4 colors.



    BITS    COLOR INFORMATION COMES FROM

     00     Background color #0 (screen color)
     01     Upper 4 bits of screen memory
     10     Lower 4 bits of screen memory
     11     Color nybble (nybble = 1/2 byte = 4 bits)
