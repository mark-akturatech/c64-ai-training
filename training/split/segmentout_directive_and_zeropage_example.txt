# Kick Assembler - Explains .segmentout directive which places bytes of an intermediate segment in the current memory block (useful for reallocating code/data and alternate outputs). Example: copying code into zeropage: zpCode: .segmentout [segments="ZeroPage_Code"] .label zpCodeSize = *-zpCode and .segment ZeroPage_Code [start=$10] zpStart: inc $d020 jmp *-3. Code demonstrates copying zeropage code into a main block.
