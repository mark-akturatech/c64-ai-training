# Kick Assembler - Explains opcode constants (mnemonic uppercase with addressing mode suffix) for self-modifying code e.g., RTS, LDA_IMM, LDA_ABS. Use asmCommandSize(RTS) to get size of an opcode (e.g., RTS=1, LDA_IMM=2, LDA_ABS=3).


LDA_IZPX

lda ($30,x)

IZPY

Indirect zeropage,y

LDA_IZPY

lda ($30),y
