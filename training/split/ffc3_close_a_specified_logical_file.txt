# C64 KERNAL API (Lee Davison) - $FFC3 — Close a specified logical file. Call with accumulator set to logical file number to close; routine finalises I/O for that file and updates file table pointers.

$FFC3          close a specified logical file
               
               This routine is used to close a logical file after all I/O operations have been
               completed on that file. This routine is called after the accumulator is loaded
               with the logical file number to be closed, the same number used when the file was
               opened using the OPEN routine.
