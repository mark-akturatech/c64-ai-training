# A Minimal C64 Datasette Program Loader - Canary bit technique used by get_byte: initialize accumulator with a 0 canary bit in position 7 (via LDA #%01111111), then shift incoming bits right with ROR. After 8 data bits the canary bit is shifted into the carry flag, signaling completion without an explicit counter.

The routine uses a "canary bit" technique: it stores a 0-bit at position 7.
As bits are shifted in from the right using ROR, the canary moves left.
After 8 data bits, the canary bit is shifted into the carry flag, which
signals completion without needing a separate counter.
