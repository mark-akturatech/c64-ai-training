# COMMODORE 64 - INPUT# <file number>, <variable list>: reads variables from an open device/file as whole variables (up to 80 chars). Terminators: CR (CHR$(13)), comma, semicolon, colon. Behavior: non-numeric data into numeric variables causes BAD DATA; strings >80 cause STRING TOO LONG; with device #3 reads an entire logical line and moves cursor. Examples of reading from file numbers.

  INPUT#

  TYPE: I/O Statement
  FORMAT: INPUT# <file number> , <variable list>

    Action: This is usually the fastest and easiest way to retrieve data
  stored in a file on disk or tape. The data is in the form of whole vari-
  ables of up to 80 characters in length, as opposed to the one-at-a-time
  method of GET#. First, the file must have been OPENed, then INPUT# can
  fill the variables.
    The INPUT# command assumes a variable is finished when it reads a
  RETURN code (CHR$ (13)), a comma (,), semicolon (;), or colon (:).
  Quote marks can be used to enclose these characters when writing if
  they are needed (see PRINT# statement).
    If the variable type used is numeric, and non-numeric characters are
  received, a BAD DATA error results. INPUT# can read strings up to 80
  characters long, beyond which a STRING TOO LONG error results.
    When used with device #3 (the screen), this statement will read an
  entire logical line and move the cursor down to the next line.

  EXAMPLES of INPUT# Statement:

  10 INPUT#1,A
  20 INPUT#2,A$,B$
