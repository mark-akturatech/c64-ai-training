# byRiclianll - Lines cover the ':  17' column portion of the dump. This chunk includes the ':  17' marker and associated byte sequences (01, OB, 02, OC, AO, 00, OA, 98) and shows the continuation of sequential pointer/offset entries for the next column of the sector. It acts as the transition from the numeric pointer table area into the subsequent zero/padding block.
