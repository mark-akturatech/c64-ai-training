# COMMODORE 64 - GET# file_number, variable_list: reads characters one-at-a-time from an open device/file. Returns empty string or 0 if no character received. Special handling of separators (comma, CR). When used with device #3 (screen) reads characters from screen and moves cursor one position; logical line end is CHR$(13). Examples of GET# use with device/file numbers.

  GET#

  TYPE: I/O Statement
  FORMAT: GET# <file number>, <variable list>


    Action: This statement reads characters one-at-a-time from the device
  or file specified. It works the same as the GET statement, except that
  the data comes from a different place than the keyboard. If no character
  is received, the variable is set to an empty string (equal to "") or to 0
  for numeric variables. Characters used to separate data in files, like
  the comma (,) or <RETURN> key code (ASC code of 13), are received like
  any other character.
    When used with device #3 (TV screen), this statement will read char-
  acters one by one from the screen. Each use of GET# moves the cursor 1
  position to the right. The character at the end of the logical line is
  changed to a CHR$ (13), the <RETURN> key code.



  EXAMPLES of GET# Statement:

    5 GET#1, A$
    10 OPEN 1,3: GET#1, Z7$
    20 GET#1, A, B, C$, D$
