# COMMODORE 64 - GOTO <line number> (or GO TO): unconditional jump to specified program line. Notes: GOTO without a number equals GOTO 0; possible to create infinite loops (e.g., 10 GOTO 10); example usages.

  GOTO

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT :GOTO <line number>
	  or GO TO <line number>

    Action: This statement allows the BASIC program to execute lines out
  of numerical order. The word GOTO followed by a number will make the
  program jump to the line with that number. GOTO NOT followed by a number
  equals GOTO 0. It must have the line number after the word GOTO.
    It is possible to create loops with GOTO that will never end. The
  simplest example of this is a line that GOes TO itself, like 10 GOTO 10.
  These loops can be stopped using the <RUN/STOP> key on the keyboard.

  EXAMPLES of GOTO Statement:

    GOTO 100
    10 GO TO 50
    20 GOTO 999
