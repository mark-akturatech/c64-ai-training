# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - RNDSED: Initial random-number seed data copied into RAM from $008B-$008F. Provides the floating-point seed value (fltp 0.811635157) used to initialize the BASIC RNG. The raw bytes for the seed are listed in-place.

                                *** RNDSED: RANDOM SEED FOR ZEROPAGE
                                This is the initial value of the seed for the random
                                number function. It is copied into RAM from $008b-$008f.
                                Its fltp value is 0.811635157.
