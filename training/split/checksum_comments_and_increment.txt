# byRiclianll - Comments and small control code related to checksum and field descriptions: labeled comments showing where CHECKSUM, SECTOR, TRACK, IDL, IDH, GAP are handled, notes about computing/incrementing the checksum, and the final INC $0628 instruction. This block documents and performs the increment of the sector pointer used across the routine.
