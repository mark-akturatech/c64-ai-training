# MACHINE - Detailed description of the CHROUT subroutine at $FFD2: purpose (sends A register to output channel), typical use (screen output), character encoding (ASCII/PET ASCII), preservation of registers A/X/Y across the call, and status flags (carry may indicate output problems on some machines).



CHROUT--The Output Subroutine
-----------------------------

The CHROUT subroutine at address $FFD2 may be used for all types of output:
to screen, to disk, to cassette tape, or to other devices.  It's similar to
PRINT and PRINT#, except that it sends only one character.  For the moment,
we'll use CHROUT only for sending information to the computer screen.

| Subroutine:   CHROUT                                                      |
| Address:      $FFD2                                                       |
| Action:       Sends a copy of the character in the A register to the      |
|               output channel.  The output channel is the computer screen  |
|               unless arrangements have been made to switch it.            |
|                                                                           |
| The character sent is usually ASCII (or PET ASCII).  When sent to the     |
| screen, all special characters--graphics, color codes, cursor movements-- |
| will be honored in the usual way.                                         |
|                                                                           |
| Registers:  All data registers are preserved during a CHROUT call.  Upon  |
| return from the subroutine, A, X, and Y will not have changed.            |
|                                                                           |
| Status:  Status flags may be changed.  In the VIC and Commodore 64, the C |
| (carry) flag indicates some type of problem with output.                  |
|                                                                           |
