# ********* - DFLTN ($99): default input device (0 = keyboard). CHKIN ($F20E) updates this to the device number defining the input channel. BASIC calls CHKIN for INPUT# or GET#, then clears the channel after the operation.

153           $99            DFLTN
Default Input Device (Set to 0 for Keyboard)

The default value of this location is 0, which designates the keyboard
as the current input device.  That value can be changed by the Kernal
routine CHKIN (61966, $F20E), which uses this location to store the
device number of the device whose file it defines as an input channel.

BASIC calls CHKIN whenever the command INPUT# or GET# is executed, but
clears the channel after the input operation has been completed.
