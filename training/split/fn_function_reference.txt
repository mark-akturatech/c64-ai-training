  FN

  TYPE: Function-Numeric
  FORMAT: FN <name> ( <number> )

    Action: This function references the previously DEFined formula spec-
  ified by name. The number is substituted into its place (if any) and the
  formula is calculated. The result will be a numeric value.
    This function can be used in direct mode, as long as the statement
  DEFining it has been executed.
    If an FN is executed before the DEF statement which defines it, an
  UNDEF'D FUNCTION error occurs.

  EXAMPLES of FN (User-Defined) Function:

    PRINT FN A(Q)
    1100 J = FN J(7)+ FN J(9)
    9990 IF FN B7 (1+1)= 6 THEN END
