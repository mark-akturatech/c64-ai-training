# COMMODORE 64 - GET statement: keyboard buffer behavior (10 chars), polling loop examples (GET A$: IF A$ = "" THEN 10), example screen-editor behaviors (no cursor printed, capturing typed characters), use of CHR$ codes for function keys (example lines mapping CHR$(133..136) to actions), and notes about buffer overflow and GET in loops.

  USING THE GET STATEMENT

    Most simple programs use the INPUT statement to get data from the
  person operating the computer. When you're dealing with more complex
  needs, like protection from typing errors, the GET statement gives you
  more flexibility and your program more "intelligence." This section shows
  you how to use the GET statement to add some special screen editing
  features to your programs.

    The Commodore 64 has a keyboard buffer that holds up to 10 characters.
  This means that if the computer is busy doing some operation and it's
  not reading the keyboard, you can still type in up to 10 characters,
  which will be used as soon as the Commodore 64 finishes what it was
  doing. To demonstrate this, type in this program on your Commodore 64:

    NEW
    10 TI$="000000"
    20 IF TI$ < "000015" THEN 20

  Now type RUN, hit <RETURN>  and while the program is RUNning type in the
  word HELLO.
    Notice that nothing happened for about IS seconds when the program
  started. Only then did the message HELLO appear on the screen.
    Imagine standing in line for a movie. The first person in the line is
  the first to get a ticket and leave the line. The last person in line is
  last for a ticket. The GET statement acts like a ticket taker. First it
  looks to see if there are any characters "in line." In other words have
  any keys been typed. If the answer is yes then that character gets placed
  in the appropriate variable. If no key was pressed then an empty value is
  assigned to a variable,
    At this point it's important to note that if you try to put more than
  10 characters into the buffer at one time, all those over the 10th
  character will be lost.
    Since the GET statement will keep going even when no character is
  typed, it is often necessary to put the GET statement into a loop so that
  it will have to wait until someone hits a key or until a character is
  received through your program.
    Below is the recommended form for the GET statement. Type NEW to erase
  your previous program.

    10 GET A$: IF A$ ="" THEN 10

  Notice that there is NO SPACE between the quote marks("") on this line.
  This indicates an empty value and sends the program back to the GET
  statement in a continuous loop until someone hits a key on the computer.
  Once a key is hit the program will continue with the line following line
  10. Add this line to your program:

    100 PRINT A$;: GOTO 10

  Now RUN the program. Notice that no cursor appears on the screen, but
  any character you type will be printed in the screen. This 2-line program
  can be turned into part of a screen editor program as shown below.
    There are many things you can do with a screen editor. You can have
  a flashing cursor. You can keep certain keys like <CLR/HOME> from
  accidentally erasing the whole screen. You might even want to be able to
  use your function keys to represent whole words or phrases. And speaking
  of function keys, the following program lines give each function key a
  special purpose. Remember this is only the beginning of a program that
  you can customize for your needs.

    20 IF A$ = CHR$(133) THEN POKE 53280,8: GOTO 10
    30 IF A$ = CHR$(134) THEN POKE 53281,4: GOTO 10
    40 IF A$ = CHR$(135) THEN A$="DEAR SIR:"+CHR$(13)
    50 IF A$ = CHR$(136) THEN A$="SINCERELY,"+CHR$(13)

    The CHR$ numbers in parentheses come from the CHR$ code chart in
  Appendix C. The chart lists a different number for each character. The
  four function keys are set up to perform the tasks represented by the
  instructions that follow the word THEN in each line. By changing the
  CHR$ number inside each set of parentheses you can designate different
  keys. Different instructions would be performed if you changed the
  information after the THEN statement.
