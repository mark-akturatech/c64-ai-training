# COMMODORE 64 - Reverse characters: how holding CTRL+9 produces a reversed-character <R> inside quotes to start reverse-video (negative display), how to end reverse printing via CTRL+0 or by printing a RETURN (CHR$(13)), and the note that ending the PRINT without trailing punctuation also ends the condition.

  2. Reverse Characters

    Holding down the <CTRL> key and hitting <9> will cause <R> to appear
  inside the quotes. This will make all characters start printing in
  reverse video (like a negative of a picture). To end the reverse printing
  hit <CTRL+0>, or else PRINT a <RETURN> (CHR$(13)). (Just ending the PRINT
  statement without a semicolon or comma will take care of this.)
