# COMMODORE 64 - SID Filter controls: FC LO/FC HI (registers $15,$16) together form an 11-bit value (bits 3–7 of FC LO unused) that linearly controls the filter Cutoff/Center Frequency (approx. 30 Hz to 12 kHz). RES/FILT (register $17): bits 4–7 (RES0–RES3) select one of 16 resonance settings (linear from 0 = no resonance to 15 = maximum resonance), which emphasize frequencies at the cutoff. Bits 0–3 (FILT1, FILT2, FILT3, FILTEX) determine routing — when a FILT bit is zero the respective signal bypasses the filter and appears directly on the audio output; when one, that signal is processed through the filter (applies to Voice 1, 2, 3, and External input on pin 26).


  FILTER

  FC LO/FC HI (Registers $15,$16)

    Together these registers form an 11-bit number (bits 3-7 of FC LO are
  not used) which linearly controls the Cutoff (or Center) Frequency of the
  programmable Filter. The approximate Cutoff Frequency ranges from 30
  Hz to 12 KHz.

  RES/FILT (Register $17)

    Bits 4-7 of this register (RES0-RES3) control the resonance of the
  filter. Resonance is a peaking effect which emphasizes frequency com-
  ponents at the Cutoff Frequency of the Filter, causing a sharper sound.
  There are 16 resonance settings ranging linearly from no resonance (0) to
  maximum resonance (15 or $F). Bits 0-3 determine which signals will be
  routed through the Filter:
    FILT 1 (Bit 0): When set to a zero, Voice 1 appears directly at the
  audio output and the Filter has no effect on it. When set to a one, Voice
  1 will be processed through the Filter and the harmonic content of Voice
  1 will be altered according to the selected Filter parameters.
    FILT 2 (Bit 1): Same as bit 0 for Voice 2.
    FILT 3 (Bit 2): Same as bit 0 for Voice 3.
    FILTEX (Bit 3): Same as bit 0 for External audio input (pin 26).
