# NMOS 6510 - Tables used by the Blackmail FLI code. Lists the values read by indirect X-indexed loads and absolute loads ($03b0 + <background colour>), the byte values arranged in ranges ($b0..$bf etc.), and the address mappings for the indirect X-indexed loads. These tables are the data that the Blackmail FLI code reads to produce the desired colours and $D011 values.

last not least, for the above code snippets to work, the following tables are used:
; values read by indirect x indexed loads
; values read by absolute loads ($03b0 + <background colour>)
03b0

b0 b1 b2 b3

b4 b5 b6 b7

b8 b9 ba bb

bc bd be bf

; addresses for indirect x indexed loads ($03b0...$03bf)
; every other value used for zp loads ($b0,$b1...$bf)
; second half also used as $d011 values ($b8, $b9...$bf)
0059

b0 03

b1 03 b2 03

b3 03 b4 03

b5 03 b6 03 b7 03

0069

b8 03

b9 03 ba 03

bb 03 bc 03

bd 03 be 03 bf 03
