# byRiclianll - Final BAM table rows showing HEX $11 entries and the summed total line ('+ 17' and '574  BLOCKS  FREE') followed by an explanatory note. The note explains the discrepancy between the raw calculated free blocks (574) and the directory-reported 'blocks free' (558) by noting that DOS reserves track 18 for its own use (16 sectors on that track remain free but are reserved and not reported).

574  BLOCKS  FREE 

Wait  a  minute!  We  calculated  574  blocks  free  hut  the  directory  shows  558.  How  do  we 
explain  this  discrepancy?  Easy.  Remember  that  the  DOS  reserves  track  18  for  its  own 
use.  Therefore  the  blocks  free  on  that  particular  track  are  not  returned  to  us  (574  - 
16  =  558).  Sixteen  sectors  on  track  18  are  still  free,  but  available  only  to  the  DOS.
