# NMOS 6510 - SLO operation semantics and usage examples. Explains the operation: shift left one bit in memory (leftmost bit -> carry), then OR the accumulator with that memory; notes that N and Z are set after the ORA. Includes an example usage (SLO $C010) and equivalence to ASL $C010 followed by ORA $C010. Contains two practical examples: a multibyte arithmetic left-shift sequence that replaces ASL/ROL/ROL/LDA with a shorter/faster sequence using SLO (and the requirement that A be zero), and an explanation of using SLO to simulate addressing modes for ASL (abs,y and indirect zp modes) when clobbering A/flags is acceptable.

Operation: Shift left one bit in memory, then OR accumulator with memory.

The leftmost bit is shifted into the carry flag
N and Z are set after the ORA

Example:
SLO $C010

;0F 10 C0

Equivalent Instructions:
ASL $C010
ORA $C010

Example: Multibyte arithmetic left shift and load lowest byte

Instead of:
ASL data+0
ROL data+1
ROL data+2
LDA data+0

; (6) lo byte
; (6)
; (6) hi byte
; (4)

you can write: (which is shorter, and faster)
LDA #0
; (2)
; A must be zero before reaching here
SLO data+0
; (6) lo byte
ROL data+1
; (6)
ROL data+2
; (6) hi byte

Example: simulate extra addressing modes for ASL

If you can afford clobbering A and the flags (or even use the final value), SLO turns into ASL and
makes some addressing modes available that do not exist for regular ASL:
; 0 is shifted into the LSB
SLO abs, y
; like ASL abs, y
SLO (zp), y
; like ASL (zp), y
SLO (zp, x)
; like ASL (zp, x)
; A was changed as with additional ORA
; N,Z were set as with additional ORA
