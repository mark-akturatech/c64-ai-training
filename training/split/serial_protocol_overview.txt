# A 256 Byte Autostart Fast Loader for the Commodore 64 - Protocol optimization that exploits synchronized CPU clocks to send two data bits per cycle (two bits transmitted simultaneously), reducing byte transfer steps from eight to four and enabling much higher throughput by using lines previously reserved for handshaking.



Serial Protocol Optimization
-----------------------------

Rather than clock-based handshaking, this approach exploits synchronized CPU
clocks between devices. Two data bits transmit simultaneously per cycle,
completing each byte in four steps instead of eight.

The protocol transmits two bits at once from the 1541 to the C64 using lines
previously reserved for handshaking.
