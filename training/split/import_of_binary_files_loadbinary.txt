# Kick Assembler - Explains LoadBinary function for loading arbitrary files into a variable. Example: .var data = LoadBinary("myDataFile") and then myData: .fill data.getSize(), data.get(i). Notes get returns signed Java bytes and uget returns unsigned bytes. Also getSize and get functions available.

.fill picture.getColorRamSize(), picture.getColorRam(i)
.fill picture.getBitmapSize(), picture.getBitmap(i)

Notice how easy it is to reallocate the screen and color ram by combining the *= and .fill directives. To avoid
typing in format types too often, Kick Assembler has some build in constants you can use:
