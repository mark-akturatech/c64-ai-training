# COMMODORE 64 - CONT: resumes execution of a program halted by STOP, END or RUN/STOP key at the place it left off. Notes about 'CAN'T CONTINUE' error after editing program or when halted by certain errors; example using a PI approximation loop to demonstrate BREAK and CONT.


  CONT

  TYPE: Command
  FORMAT: CONT

    Action: This command re-starts the execution of a program which was
  halted by a STOP or END statement or the <RUN/STOP> key being pressed.
  The program will re-start at the exact place from which it left off.
    While the program is stopped, the user can inspect or change any
  variables or look at the program. When debugging or examining a program,
  STOP statements can be placed at strategic locations to allow examination
  of variables and to check the flow of the program.
    The error message CAN'T CONTINUE will result from editing the program
  (even just hitting <RETURN> with the cursor on an unchanged line), or if
  the program halted due to an error, or if you caused an error before
  typing CONT to re-start the program.

  EXAMPLE of CONT Command:

    10 PI=0:C=1
    20 PI=PI+4/C-4/(C+2)
    30 PRINT PI
    40 C=C+4:GOTO 20

                                             BASIC LANGUAGE VOCABULARY   41

    This program calculates the value of PI. RUN this program, and after
  a short while hit the <RUN/STOP> key. You will see the display:

                 +----------------------------------+
    BREAK IN 20  | NOTE: Might be different number. |
                 +----------------------------------+

    Type the command PRINT C to see how far the Commodore 64 has gotten.
  Then use CONT to resume from where the Commodore 64 left off.
