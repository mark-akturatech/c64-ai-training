# Contents - Introduces graphics memory limitations of the VIC-II: although the C64 has 64K RAM, the VIC can reference only one 16K block at a time (four possible banks). Explains that the default bank at power-up is $0000-$3FFF and describes how to change the VIC bank by setting the least-significant two bits of $DD00 to the desired bank value. Also states the prerequisite of setting the appropriate control-selection bits (bits 0 and 1) of $DD02 to 1 before changing $DD00.

GRAPHICS MEMORY LOCATIONS 

Although the Commodore 64 has 64K of 
memory, the VIC chip can only reference 16K of 
memory at any one time. Fortunately, you can 
change which of the four 16K blocks of memory in 



the computer the VIC chip will be able to use. When 
the Commodore 64 is powered up, bank of 
memory ($0000-$3FFF) is selected. If you wish to 
change the bank of memory that the VIC chip will 
use, you must set the least significant two bits of 
$DD00 to the value that represents the desired 
bank. Before doing so, you must set bits and 1 
of $DD02 to 1. This will select the control bits that
