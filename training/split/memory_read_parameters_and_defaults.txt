# byRiclianll - Explains the parameters used by the M-R command: file# (logical file number of the command channel), lo-byte and hi-byte (low and high bytes of the memory address), and # of bytes (1 to 255). Notes that the third parameter CHR$(# of bytes) is undocumented, optional, and defaults to CHR$(1).

where 


file# 


=  the  logical  file  number  of  the  command  channel 


lo-byte 


=  lo-byte  of  the  memory  address 


hi-byte 


=  hi-byte  of  the  memory  address 


#  of  bytes     =  1  to  255 

The  third  parameter  of  the  memory-read  command,  CHR$(#  of  bytes),  is  undocumented 
by  Commodore.  The  use  of  the  third  parameter  is  always  optional.  The  default  is  CHR$(1), 
i.e.,  1  byte.
