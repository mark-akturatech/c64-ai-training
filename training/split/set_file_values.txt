# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - SET FILE VALUES (SEETF): Given an offset in (X) into the file tables, sets current logical number LA ($B8), device FA ($BA) and secondary address SA ($B9) by loading from LAT ($0259), FAT ($0263) and SAT ($026D). Uses indexed LDA/STA.

                                *** SEET FILE VALUES
                                This routine sets the current logical file number, device
                                number and secondary address from the file parameter
                                tables. On entry (X) must hold the offset to the position
                                of the file in the table.
