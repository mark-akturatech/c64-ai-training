# byRiclianll - Notes about tail gaps: the gap after the highest-numbered sector to sector 0 is usually much longer (can exceed 100 bytes). Also explains that header blocks are never rewritten after formatting; data blocks (including sync) are rewritten whenever the sector is written. The DOS uses the eight-byte header gap to determine where to start writing the data block.

Note  that  the  values  given  above  do  not  apply  to  the  highest  numbered  sector  on  a  track. 
The  gap  between  this  sector  and  sector  0  is  usually  much  longer.  We  have  seen  tail  gaps 
in  excess  of  100  bytes  here. 

Also  note  that  a  header  block  is  never  rewritten  after  formatting  is  complete.  The  data 
block  of  a  sector,  including  the  sync  character,  is  completely  rewritten  every  time  data 
is  written  to  that  sector.  The  eight  byte  header  gap  is  counted  off  by  the  DOS  to  deter- 
mine where  to  start  writing  the  data  block.
