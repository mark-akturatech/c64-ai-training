# COMMODORE 64 - Output to printer: formatting concerns, SPC works but TAB doesn't, OPEN statement selects character set for printer (upper/graphics or upper/lower). Provides control character codes for printer (CHR$ codes like 10 LF, 13 RETURN, 14 begin double-width, 15 end double-width, 18 begin reverse, 146 end reverse, 17/145 switch sets, 16 tab positions, 27 move to dot position, 8 begin dot graphics, 26 repeat graphics). Recommends consulting printer manual for details.



  DATA STORAGE ON FLOPPY DISKETTES

    Diskettes allow 3 different forms of data storage. Sequential files are
  similar to those on tape, but several can can be used at the same time.
  Relative files let you organize the data into records, and then read and
  replace individual records within the file. Random files let you work
  with data anywhere on the disk. They are organized into 256 byte sections
  called blocks.
    The PRINT# statement's limitations are discussed in the section on
  cassette tape. The same limitations to format apply on the disk. RETURNs
  or commas are needed to separate your data. The CHR$(0) is still read by
  the GET# statement as an empty string.
    Relative and random files both make use of separate data and command
  "channels." Data written to the disk goes through the data channel, where
  it is stored in a temporary buffer in the disk's RAM. When the record or
  block is complete, a command is sent through the command channel that
  tells the drive where to put the data, and the entire buffer is written.
    Applications that require large amounts of data to be processed are
  best stored in relative disk files. These will use the least amount of
  time and provide the best flexibility for the programmer. Your disk drive
  manual gives a complete programming guide to use of disk files.

  THE GAME PORTS

    The Commodore 64 has two 9-pin Game Ports which allow the use of
  joysticks, paddies, or a light pen. Each port will accept either one joy-
  stick or one paddle pair. A light pen can be plugged into Port A (only)
  for special graphic control, etc. This section gives you examples of how
  to use the joysticks and paddies from both BASIC and machine language.
    The digital joystick is connected to CIA #1 (MOS 6526 Complex Interface
  Adapter). This input/output device also handles the paddle fire buttons
  and keyboard scanning. The 6526 CIA chip has 16 registers which are in
  memory locations 56320 through 56335 inclusive ($DC00 to $DC0F). Port A
  data appears at location 56320 (DC00) and Port B data is found at
  location 56321 ($DC01).
    A digital joystick has five distinct switches, four of the switches are
  used for direction and one of the switches is used for the fire button.
  The joystick switches are arranged as shown:


                                    (Top)
                FIRE
             (Switch 4)
                                     UP
                                 (Switch 0)
                                      |
                                      |
                                      |
                         LEFT         |         RIGHT
                               -------+-------
                      (Switch 2)      |       (Switch 3)
                                      |
                                      |
                                      |
                                    DOWN
                                 (Switch 1)


    These switches correspond to the lower 5 bits of the data in location
  56320 or 56321. Normally the bit is set to a one if a direction is NOT
  chosen or the fire button is NOT pressed. When the fire button is
