# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Wrapper at $FF90 that JMPs to $FE18 to set the KERNAL message mode (enable/disable error/control messages).

                                *** control kernal messages
                                this routine controls the printing of error and control messages by the KERNAL.
                                Either print error messages or print control messages can be selected by setting
                                the accumulator when the routine is called.
                                FILE NOT FOUND is an example of an error message. PRESS PLAY ON CASSETTE is an
                                example of a control message.
                                bits 6 and 7 of this value determine where the message will come from. If bit 7
                                is set one of the error messages from the KERNAL will be printed. If bit 6 is set
                                a control message will be printed.
