# 6502 ADDRESSING MODES - SUMMARY: Overview that low-level instructions often contain operands which refer to memory locations (addressing modes). Summary of Absolute (Direct) addressing: operand is the memory address; example LDA $6F55 loads accumulator from $6F55.

SUMMARY
Low level instructions often contain an operand, which is usually a memory address.  It normally refers to the location of a data item in the computers memory.  There are several ways in which the processor might interpret the operand, and these are called addressing modes.  The examples below are the five basic modes available in some form on most processors.
Absolute (Direct) addressing
The operand is the address in memory where the data item can be found.
LDA	$6F55		This instruction will access memory location $6F55, and copy the contents into the accumulator register.
