# VIC-II Memory Banking and Address Configuration Guide - Bitmap mode base selection (uses bit 3 of $D018): when bitmap mode is active, bit 3 chooses one of two bitmap base addresses within the current bank:
- Bit 3 = 0 -> Bitmap at bank base + $0000
- Bit 3 = 1 -> Bitmap at bank base + $2000
Note: a bitmap needs 8000 bytes, occupying nearly half of a 16 KB bank.

Bitmap Mode Base Address (Bit 3)
---------------------------------

In bitmap mode, bit 3 of $D018 selects between two possible bitmap memory
locations within the bank:

  Bit 3 = 0  ->  Bitmap at bank base + $0000
  Bit 3 = 1  ->  Bitmap at bank base + $2000

Since a bitmap requires 8000 bytes, it occupies nearly half the 16 KB bank.
