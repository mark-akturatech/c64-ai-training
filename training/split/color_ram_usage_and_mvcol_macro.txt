# Contents - Color memory is fixed (VIC cannot remap it). The MVCOL macro fills color RAM with a single color (example: MVCOL WHITE). Notes on text memory vs color RAM handling in different graphics modes and advice to check graphics mode if output looks wrong.


Color memory does not move, and the VIC chip 
cannot use a different section of memory for the col- 
or information. The MVCOL macro will fill color

RAM with a single color. For instance, if you wanted 
all of the text tobe white, you would enter "MVCOL 
WHITE." The text memory and color RAM are 
treated differently by the different graphics modes. 
If your picture doesn't look like you expect, check 
to be sure that the proper graphics mode has been 
selected.
