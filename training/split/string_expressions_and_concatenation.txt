# COMMODORE 64 - String expressions and concatenation: only '+' is defined for string concatenation in CBM BASIC; concatenation appends the right string to the left; results can be printed, compared, or assigned; mixing string and numeric types in comparisons or assignments causes ?TYPE MISMATCH. Examples showing concatenation and explicit spacing.

  STRING EXPRESSIONS

    Expressions are treated as if an implied "<>0" follows them. This means
  that if an expression is true then the next BASIC statements on. the same
  program line are executed. If the expression is false the rest of the
  line is ignored and the next line in the program is executed.
    Just as with numbers, you can also perform operations on string vari-
  ables. The only string arithmetic operator recognized by CBM BASIC is the
  plus sign (+) which is used to perform concatenation of strings. When
  strings are concatenated, the string on the right of the plus sign is
  appended to the string on the left, forming a third string as a result.
  The result can be printed immediately, used in a comparison, or assigned
  to a variable name. If a string data item is compared with (or set equal
  to) a numeric item, or vice-versa, the BASIC error message ?TYPE MISMATCH
  will occur. Some examples of string expressions and concatenation are:
