# byRiclianll - Table of the BAM sector (track 18 sector 0) byte field offsets and purposes: bytes 0-1 pointer to first directory sector (18/1), byte 2 ASCII format char (A = 1541/4040 format), byte 3 unused, bytes 4-143 the Block Availability Map (4 bytes per track for 35 tracks = 140 bytes), bytes 144-159 diskette name (ASCII padded), bytes 160-161 shifted spaces, bytes 162-163 disk ID, bytes 165-166 DOS version/format type (e.g., 2A), remaining bytes unused.

As  indicated  above,  the  BAM  does  not  take  up  all  256  bytes  on  this  sector.  There  are 
several  other  things  stored  here  as  well.  The  table  below  identifies  the  various  parts. 
Note  that  the  sector  dump  above  uses  hexadecimal  notation  while  the  table  below  gives 
the  decimal  equivalents.
