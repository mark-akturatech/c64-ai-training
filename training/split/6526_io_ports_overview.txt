# COMMODORE 64 - Introduction to the 6526 I/O ports (PRA, PRB, DDRA, DDRB). Explains that each port has an 8-bit Peripheral Data Register and Data Direction Register; DDR bits set output vs input; reads reflect port pin states; passive and active pull-ups for CMOS/TTL compatibility; two TTL load drive; PB6 and PB7 provide timer output functions in addition to normal I/O.

  6526 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION

  I/O Ports (PRA, PRB, DDRA, DDRB).

    Ports A and B each consist of an 8-bit Peripheral Data Register (PR)
  and an 8-bit Data Direction Register (DDR). If a bit in the DDR is set to
  a one, the corresponding bit in the PR is an output; if a DDR bit is set
  to a zero, the corresponding PR bit is defined as an input. On a READ,
  the PR reflects the information present on the actual port pins (PA0-PA7,
  PB0-PB7) for both input and output bits. Port A and Port B have passive
  pull-up devices as well as active pull-ups, providing both CMOS and TTL
  compatibility. Both ports have two TTL load drive capability. In addition
  to normal I/O operation, PB6 and PB7 also provide timer output functions.
