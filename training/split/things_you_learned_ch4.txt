# MACHINE - Chapter 4 summary bullets: signed vs unsigned numbers; multi-byte numbers and carry handling; ADC with CLC for add; SBC with SEC for subtract; checking C and V for overflow depending on signed/unsigned; ASL/ROL and LSR/ROR use for multiply/divide; shift/rotate can operate on A or memory; subroutines in machine language.



Things You Have Learned
-----------------------

- We may decide to use a number as a signed value; in this case, the high bit
  of the number will be 0 if the number is positive and 1 if the number is
  negative.  It's up to us.  As far as the computer is concerned, it's just
  bits in either case.

- When a number might have a value that won't fit into an eight-bit byte, we
  may use more than one byte to hold the value.  We have already done this to
  hold addresses in two bytes:  there's a high byte to hold the high part of
  the value and a low byte to hold the low part.

- We may add two numbers together using the ADC instruction with the A
  register; we should always clear the carry flag before starting an
  addition.  The carry flag will take care of multi-byte numbers for us,
  providing we remember to start the addition at the low end.

- We may subtract two numbers using the SBC instruction with the A register;
  we should always set the carry flag before starting a subtraction.  The
  carry--which is sometimes called an inverted borrow--will take care of
  multi-byte numbers for us, providing we remember to start the subtraction
  at the low end.

- For unsigned numbers, the carry should end up as it started (clear for
  addition, set for subtraction); otherwise we have overflow in the result.
  For signed numbers, the carry doesn't matter; the V flag will be set if we
  have overflow.

- We may multiply a byte by two with the ASL (arithmetic shift left)
  instruction.  If we have a multiple-byte number, we may carry the
  multiplication through to other bytes by using the ROL (rotate left)
  instruction, starting at the low byte of the number.

- We may divide a byte by two with the LSR (logical shift right) instruction.
  If we have a multiple-byte number, we may carry the division through to
  other bytes by using the ROR (rotate right) instruction, starting at the
  high byte of the number.

- The shift and rotate instructions may be used on the contents of the A
  register or directly on memory.  The N and Z flags are affected, and the C
  flag plays an important role in the shift/rotate action.
