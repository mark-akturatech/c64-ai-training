# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - MEMTOP: Read/Set top of memory (vectored from $ffa9). If carry set on entry: loads MEMTOP into X/Y from MEMSIZ ($0283/$0284). If carry clear: stores X/Y into MEMSIZ. Uses BCC/LDX/LDY/STX/STY and returns.

                                *** MEMTOP: READ/SET TOP OF MEMORY
                                The KERNAL routine MEMTOP ($ffa9) jumps to this routine.
                                If carry is set on entry, the top of memory address will
                                be loaded into (X/Y). If carry is clear on entry, the top
                                of memory will be set according to the contents in (X/Y)
