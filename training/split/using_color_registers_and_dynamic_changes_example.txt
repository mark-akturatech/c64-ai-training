# COMMODORE 64 - Explains that color registers are indirect references used by many screen positions. Changing a background or indirect color register changes all dots using that register. Includes BASIC example (page118.prg) that alternates colors by poking 53282 with random values and demonstrates user control via color keys.


    The screen color is white, the character color is black, one color
  register is cyan (greenish blue), the other is orange. You're not really
  putting color codes in the space for character color, you're actually
  using references to the registers associated with those colors. This
  conserves memory, since 2 bits can be used to pick 16 colors (background)
  or 8 colors (character). This also makes some neat tricks possible.
  Simply changing one of the indirect registers will change every dot drawn
  in that color. Therefore everything drawn in the screen and background

  colors can be changed on the whole screen instantly. Here is an example
  of changing background color register #1:

start tok64 page118.prg
  100 poke53270,peek(53270)or16: rem turn on multicolor mode
  110 print chr$(147)chr$(18);
  120 print"{orange*2}";: rem type c= & 1 for orange or multicolor black bg
  130 forl=1to22:printchr$(65);:next
  135 fort=1to500:next
  140 print"{blue*2}";: rem type ctrl & 7 for blue color change
  145 fort=1to500:next
  150 print"{black}hit a key"
  160 get a$:if a$=""then160
  170 x=int(rnd(1)*16)
  180 poke 53282,x
  190 goto 160
stop tok64
