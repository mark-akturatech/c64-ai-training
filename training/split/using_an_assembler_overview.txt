# Contents - Overview of using an assembler for the book's assembly-language examples: recommends assembly for examples, suggests BASIC programmers may reuse routines, explains that each assembler has its own pseudo-opcodes, and introduces that the listings use Commodore's Macro Assembler Development System (and can be adapted to other assemblers).

USING AN ASSEMBLER 

The rest of this book assumes that you will be 
programming in assembly language, and most of the 
examples are written in assembly language. If you 
are a BASIC programmer, you may be able to use 
some of these routines to speed up parts of your 
programs. 

Each assembler has its own set of pseudo 
opcodes— the instructions that tell the assembler to 
do something other than create code. In order to en- 
sure that you will be able to use these routines, the 
following is a listing of the pseudo-opcodes used by 
Commodore's Macro Assembler Development 
System, which is the assembler used in this book. 
By modifying these instructions to match those of 
your assembler, you should be able to run any of 
the examples in this book. Normally, you can type 
in one of these instructions anywhere that it is legal 
to type in one of the CPU's opcodes.
