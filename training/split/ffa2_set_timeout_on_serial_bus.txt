# C64 KERNAL API (Lee Davison) - $FFA2 — Set timeout on serial bus. Controls serial bus timeout flag: accumulator bit 7 = 0 enables timeouts (device wait 64 ms), bit 7 = 1 disables timeouts. Timeouts allow detection of conditions like 'file not found' on disk attempts.

$FFA2          set timeout on serial bus
               
               This routine sets the timeout flag for the serial bus. When the timeout flag is
               set, the computer will wait for a device on the serial port for 64 milliseconds.
               If the device does not respond to the computer's DAV signal within that time the
               computer will recognize an error condition and leave the handshake sequence. When
               this routine is called and the accumulator contains a 0 in bit 7, timeouts are
               enabled. A 1 in bit 7 will disable the timeouts.
               
               NOTE: The the timeout feature is used to communicate that a disk file is not found
               on an attempt to OPEN a file.
