# MACHINE - Final ASL/ROL pair to double the times-five value into times-ten (ASL $033D; ROL $033C). Then code to write the resulting high and low bytes back into the integer variable V% using indirect Y addressing: LDY #$02; LDA $033C; STA ($2D),Y; LDY #$03; LDA $033D; STA ($2D),Y; RTS.

Now locations $033C/$033D contain the original number times five.  If we
double the number one last time, we'll have the value times ten.

  .A 08B3  ASL $033D
  .A 08B6  ROL $033C

We have multiplied the number by ten.  Now let's put it back into the
variable

  .A 08B9  LDY #$02
  .A 08BB  LDA $033C
  .A 08BE  STA ($2D),Y
  .A 08C0  LDY #$03
  .A 08C2  LDA $033D
  .A 08C5  STA ($2D),Y
  .A 08C7  RTS
