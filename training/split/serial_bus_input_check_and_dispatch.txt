# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Handle input when the device is the serial bus: check the serial status byte ($90); if no errors, continue to serial input routine; otherwise return CR (0x0D) as [EOL] with carry clear. On success, jumps to the serial input bit-level handler (at $EE13).

                                input device was serial bus
.,F1AD A5 90    LDA $90         get the serial status byte
.,F1AF F0 04    BEQ $F1B5       if no errors flagged go input byte and return
.,F1B1 A9 0D    LDA #$0D        else return [EOL]
.,F1B3 18       CLC             flag no error
.,F1B4 60       RTS             
.,F1B5 4C 13 EE JMP $EE13       input byte from serial bus and return
                                input device was RS232 device
