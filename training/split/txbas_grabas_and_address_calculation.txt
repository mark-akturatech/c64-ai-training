# Contents - Documents the TXBAS macro (change text base) and the GRABAS macro (change graphics base). Explains that the text and graphics base addresses selected via VIDBAS must be added to the currently selected memory bank to obtain absolute addresses. Provides a worked example: with bank 1 ($4000-$7FFF) and a text base of $0400, the text data would be found at $4400.

The TXBAS macro can be used to change the 
base address where the text will be located. Similar- 
ly, the GRAB AS macro can be used to change the 
base address of graphics memory. It is important 
to remember that the text and graphics base ad- 
dresses must be added to the bank that is current- 
ly selected in order to find the absolute address in 
memory where the data will be found. For exam- 
ple, if you had selected bank 1 of memory 
($4000-$7FFF) and the text base address was 
80400, the text data would be found at $4400. If you
