# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Substitution example: replacing LDX var / INX / STX var sequence (10 cycles) with INC var (faster), when the loaded value isn't needed later. Illustrates choosing instruction sequences to reduce cycles.

Substituting Instructions
Sometimes you can rewrite a simple sequence of instructions to execute faster. Imagine that you want to increment a byte in memory, and use this sequence for it:


           ldx var
           inx
           stx var
This is pretty bad, at least if you're not actually using the value afterwards. The above code takes $ 4+2+4 = 10$ cycles. If you'd just used a simple INC var instead, you would have saved 4 cycles!
