# VIC-II Memory Banking and Address Configuration Guide - VIC-II addressing basics: VIC-II has 14 address lines and accesses one 16 KB bank at a time (full 64 KB is four 16 KB banks). Two bits of CIA-2 Port A ($DD00) select the bank. Note: the bit patterns are inverted by the memory management circuit.

Overview
--------

The VIC-II chip has only 14 addressing lines and can therefore only address
16 KB of memory at a time. The full 64 KB address space is divided into four
16 KB banks. Two bits in Port A of CIA-2 ($DD00) direct the VIC-II to one
of these four banks.

There is an inverse connection between the bit patterns and the bank memory
addresses, due to inverters in the memory management circuit.
