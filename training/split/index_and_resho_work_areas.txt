# ********* - INDEX ($22-$25) and RESHO ($26-$2A): miscellaneous temporary pointers and save area (INDEX) used by many BASIC routines for transient pointers and calculation results; RESHO is the floating-point multiplication/division work area and is also used to compute array storage size during DIM construction.

34-37         $22-$25        INDEX
Miscellaneous Temporary Pointers and Save Area

This area is used by many BASIC routines to hold temporary pointers
and calculation results.

38-42         $26-$2A        RESHO
Floating Point Multiplication Work Area

This location is used by BASIC multiplication and division routines.
It is also used by the routines which compute the size of the area
required to store an array which is being created.
