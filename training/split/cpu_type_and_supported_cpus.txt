# ca65 Users Guide - The --cpu type option: sets the default CPU type for the assembler. Lists supported CPU type names and short descriptions, including 6502 variants (6502, 6502X, 6502DTV), CMOS and extended sets (65SC02, 65C02, W65C02, 65CE02), C65/MEGA65 CPUs (4510, 45GS02), HuC6280, M740, 65816, and sweet16 interpreter.

--cpu type
Set the default for the CPU type. The option takes a parameter, which may be one of

6502 - NMOS 6502 (all legal instructions)
6502X - NMOS 6502 with all undocumented instructions
6502DTV - the emulated CPU of the C64DTV device
65SC02 - first CMOS instruction set (no bit manipulation, no wai/stp)
65C02 - CMOS with Rockwell extensions
W65C02 - full CMOS instruction set (has bit manipulation and wai/stp)
65CE02 - CMOS with CSG extensions
4510 - the CPU of the Commodore C65
45GS02 - the CPU of the Commodore MEGA65
HuC6280 - the CPU of the PC engine
M740 - a Microcontroller by Mitsubishi
65816 - the CPU of the SNES, and the SCPU
sweet16 - an interpreter for a pseudo 16 bit CPU
