657           $291           MODE
Flag: Enable or Disable Changing Character Sets with SHIFT/Logo
Keypress

This flag is used to enable or disable the feature which lets you
switch between the uppercase/graphics and upper/lowercase character
sets by pressing the SHIFT and Commodore logo keys simultaneously.

This flag affects only this special SHIFT key function, and does not
affect the printing of SHIFTed characters.  POKEing a value of 128
($80) here will disable this feature, while POKEing a value of 0 will
enable it once more.  The same effect can be achieved by PRINTing
CHR$(8) or CTRL-H to disable the switching of character sets, and
CHR$(9) or CTRL-I to enable it.  See entries for locations 53272
($D018) and 49152 ($C000) for more information on switching character
sets.
