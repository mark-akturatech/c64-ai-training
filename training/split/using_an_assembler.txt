# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Turbo Assembler usage notes: entering editor (sys $9000), assemble (←-3), save/assemble to disk, restore to assembler (RESTORE may return to editor), versions may differ (macros, undocumented opcodes).

Using an Assembler
Learning to use an assembler may be a bit more difficult than learning to use a monitor, but most people would probably think that it's easier to use an assembler than a monitor. When you've loaded and started Turbo Assembler (sys $9000), you end up in the editor, in which you write code. The syntax is just like the exemples in this text.

Most commands in Turbo Assembler are invoked by pressing $ \leftarrow$ , followed by some other key. To assemble a program, use $ \leftarrow$ - 3. This will assemble the program, and if you press s just after the assembly, the program is started automatically. When you're in the program, you can get back to Turbo Assembler by pressing RESTORE5. If that doesn't work, you can reset and type sys $9000, which should bring you back, unless you've managed to overwrite the memory of Turbo Assembler.

Some other nice commands are:


$ \leftarrow$ - 5 - assemble to object file on disk
$ \leftarrow$ - s - save source to disk
$ \leftarrow$ - l - load source from disk
$ \leftarrow$ - 1 - exit to basic
The rest you'll have to figure out for yourself. There are documents available on the web about how to use Turbo Assembler. There are also lots of different versions floating around, some of which support macros and some of which support undocumented opcodes. You can try different versions to see which one you like best, but for now it shouldn't matter which version you use.
