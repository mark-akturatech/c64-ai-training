2.4 INSERTION OF DISKETTE

There is different way to open and close the drive door, and
insertion/removal the diskette.

TYPE 1: figure 1.A -- To open the door on the drive, simply press the
door catch lightly, and the door will pop open. If there is a diskette
in the drive, it is ejected by a small spring.  Take the diskette to
be inserted, and place it in the drive face-up with the large opening
going in first and write-protect notch to the left (covered with tape
in the demonstration disk) (see figure 4).

Press it in gently, and when the diskette is in all the way, you will
feel a click and the diskette will not spring out.  Close the drive
door by pulling downward until the latch clicks into place.  Now you
are ready to begin working with the diskette.

TYPE 2: figure 1.B -- To open the door on the drive, simply turn the
door lever counter-clockwise. Take the diskette to be inserted, and
place it in the drive face-up with the large opening going in first
and write-protect notch to the left (covered with tape in the
demonstration disk) (see figure 4).

Close the drive door by turning clockwise direction until the latch
clicks into place.  Now you are ready to begin working with the disk.

Remember to always remove the diskette before the drive is turned off
or on. Never remove the diskette when the red drive light in on!  Data
can be destroyed by the drive at this time!
