# MACHINE - Appendix G introduction: 'Uncrashing'. Discusses debugging with BRK instruction breakpoints and outlines 'uncrashing' as a last-resort recovery technique for when programs crash and unsaved work would otherwise be lost. Notes behavior varies by machine and the approach depends on available hardware/monitor features.

                                                         Uncrashing



It's best to write a program that doesn't fail (or "crash").  Not all of us
succeed in doing this.

If a program gives us trouble, it should be tested using breakpoint
techniques.  The BRK (break) instruction is inserted at several strategic
points within the program.  The program stops (or "breaks") at these points,
and the programmer has an opportunity to confirm correct behavior of the
program at selected points.  Using this technique, a fault can be pinned down
quite closely.

Occasionally, usually because of bad planning, a program crashes and the
cause of the crash cannot be identified.  Worse still, a lengthy program
crashes and the user has forgotten to save a copy of it; the user is then
faced with the task of putting it in all over again.

In such cases, uncrashing techniques are sometimes available to bring the
computer back from limbo.  They are never entirely satisfactory, and should
be thought of as a last resort.

The technique differs from computer to computer.
