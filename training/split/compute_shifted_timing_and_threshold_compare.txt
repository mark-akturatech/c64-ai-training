# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Compute scaled timing values by shifting the measured ($FFFF - T2C) right twice (divide by 4) and compare it with a threshold computed as min + $3C (from $B0 plus constant). If the measured value is below threshold, branch to the short-pulse handling path. Saves intermediate results in $B1.
