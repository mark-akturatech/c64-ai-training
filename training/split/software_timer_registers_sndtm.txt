# Contents - Explanation of the two Sound Editor timer registers (RAM locations, not SID registers) treated as a 16-bit countdown timer decremented every 1/60 second. When the 16-bit value reaches $0000, the release sequence is initiated for all three channels. Defines SNDTM1 (low-order 8 bits of the 16-bit timer) and SNDTM1+1 (high-order 8 bits).


The last two registers used by the Sound Editor 
are not SID registers but RAM locations. These 
-egisters are treated as a 16 bit value that is used 
as a time counter. They are decremented every 1/60 



of a second. When the 16 bit value has been 
decremented to $0000, the release sequence is in- 
itiated for all three channels. 



SNDTM1 This is the low order 8 bits of a 16 bit value that determines the time in 1/60 

second intervals before the release sequence is initiated. 

SNDTM1+ 1 This is the high order 8 bits of a 16 bit value that determines the time in 1 /60 

second intervals before the release sequence is initiated.
