# - C64 RAM Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $0316-$0317 CBINV: vector for BRK instruction interrupt. Points to routine executed on BRK (00). Default points to routine that calls Kernal init routines (RESTOR, IOINIT, part of CINT) and jumps to BASIC warm start; used by STOP/RESTORE and BRK. ML monitors usually repoint this vector to monitor warm start for breakpoints.

$0316-$0317  CBINV   Vector: BRK Instruction Interrupt
                     
                     This vector points to the address of the routine which will be
                     executed anytime that a 6510 BRK instruction (00) is encountered.
                     
                     The default value points to a routine that calls several of the Kernal
                     initialization routines such as RESTOR, IOINIT and part of CINT, and
                     then jumps through the BASIC warm start vector at 40962.  This is the
                     same routine that is used when the STOP and RESTORE keys are pressed
                     simultaneously, and is currently located at 65126 ($FE66).
                     
                     A machine language monitor program will usually change this vector to
                     point to the monitor warm start address, so that break points may be
                     set that will return control to the monitor for debugging purposes.
