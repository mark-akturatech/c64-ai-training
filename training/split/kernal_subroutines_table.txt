# MACHINE - Table of six major Kernal subroutines and their addresses and effects. Shows Address, Name, Action, and Registers Changed: $FFC6 CHKIN (switch input to logical file X) affects A,X; $FFC9 CHKOUT affects A,X; $FFCC CLRCHN restores I/O defaults affects A,X; $FFD2 CHROUT outputs ASCII char in A (none); $FFE1 STOP checks RUN/STOP key (A); $FFE4 GETIN gets ASCII char into A (affects A,X,Y).

The six major Kernal subroutines:

Address  Name    Action                              Registers Changed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
$FFC6    CHKIN   Switch input to logical file X      A,X
$FFC9    CHKOUT  Switch output to logical file X     A,X
$FFCC    CLRCHN  Restore input/output defaults       A,X
$FFD2    CHROUT  Output ASCII character in A         none
$FFE1    STOP    Check RUN/STOP key                  A
$FFE4    GETIN   Get ASCII character into A          A,X,Y
