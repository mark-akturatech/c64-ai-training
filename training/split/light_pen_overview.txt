# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Light Pen registers ($D013-$D014 / 53283-53284): describes how a light pen plugged into joystick port 1 triggers at the moment the raster strikes it and how VIC-II latches the horizontal and vertical coordinates once per frame (60Hz). Recommends averaging samples for accuracy.

$D013-$D014               Light Pen Registers

                          A light pen is an input device that can be plugged into joystick
                          Control Port #1.  It is shaped like a pen and has a light-sensitive
                          device at its tip that causes the trigger switch of the joystick port
                          to close at the moment the electron beam that updates the screen
                          display strikes it.  The VIC-II chip keeps track of where the beam is
                          when that happens, and records the corresponding horizontal and
                          vertical screen coordinates in the registers at these locations.

                          A program can read the position at which the light pen is held up to
                          the screen.  The values in these registers are updated once every
                          screen frame (60 times per second).  Once the switch is closed and a
                          value written to these registers, the registers are latched, and
                          subsequent switch closings during the same screen frame will not be
                          recorded.

                          A given light pen may not be entirely accurate (and the operator may
                          not have a steady hand).  It is probably wise to average the positions
                          returned from a number of samplings, particularly when using a machine
                          language driver.
