# ********* - BASIC input/text scanning variables: CHARAC ($07) stores ASCII values of characters significant to the scanner (quotes, comma, colon, end-of-line); ENDCHR ($08) used as a work byte during tokenization (often 0 or 34); TRMPOS ($09) holds the cursor column position prior to the last TAB or SPC (logical line position 0–79) and is used to compute tab/spaces behavior.

7             $7             CHARAC
Search Character for Scanning BASIC Text Input

This location and the next are used heavily by the BASIC routines that
scan the text that comes into the buffer at 512 ($200), in order to
detect significant characters such as quotes, comma, the colon which
separates BASIC statements, and end-of-line.  The ASCII values of such
special characters are usually stored here.

This location is also used as a work area by other BASIC routines that
do not involve scanning text.

8             $8             ENDCHR
Search Character for Statement Termination or Quote

Like location 7, this location is used as a work byte during the
tokenization of a BASIC statement.  Most of the time, its value is 0
or 34.

9             $9             TRMPOS
Column position of the Cursor before the Last TAB or SPC

TRMPOS is used by TAB and SPC.  The cursor column position prior to
the TAB or SPC is moved here from 211 ($D3), and is used to calculate
where the cursor ends up after one of these functions is invoked.
Note that the value contained here shows the position of the cursor on
a logical line.  Since one logical line can be up to two physical
lines long, the value stored here can range from 0 to 79.
