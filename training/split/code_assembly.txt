# A 256 Byte Autostart Fast Loader for the Commodore 64 - Build layout and segments in ca65 assembly: segments include LOADADDR (program header), PART2 (main receive logic), VECTOR (stack protection bytes), CMD ("M-E" command string), START (jump to main), and FCODE (1541 drive code). Linker script maps segments into memory exploiting the stack trick and command buffer positioning.



Code Assembly
-------------

The article provides complete source code in ca65 assembly format,
organized into segments:

  LOADADDR - Program header
  PART2    - Main receive logic
  VECTOR   - Stack protection bytes
  CMD      - "M-E" command string
  START    - Jump to main
  FCODE    - 1541 drive code

The linker script maps these segments into specific memory regions,
exploiting the stack trick and command buffer positioning.
