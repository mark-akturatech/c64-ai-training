           *** on the orginal NMOS CPU, the lookup of the effective address high-byte is
               always performed on the same memory page as the low-byte (e.g., "JMP ($11FF)"
               resolves to a lookup at $11FF for the low-byte and at $1100 for the high-byte)
               for the CMOS version, add 1 to cycle, if the address is at a page boundary

                            M7 .... memory bit 7
          Note on assembler syntax:
          Some assemblers employ "OPC *oper" or a ".b" extension to the mneomonic for
          forced zeropage addressing.
          Note on Read-Modify-Write instructions (NMOS 6502 only):
          Some instructions, like EOR, ASL, ROL, DEC, INC, etc., fetch a value from memory
          to modify it and to write the modified value back to the originating address.
          The original NMOS 6502 switches immediately into write mode after the read of
          the value, resulting in the unmodified value being written back to the address
          (while the value is modified in the next cycle), before the modified value is
          finally written to the destination.
          Normally, this should be of no concern, but it may cause issues when writing to
          a device attached to the address bus that may trigger some action on any write
          operation, as this address will be strobed twice (once for the intermediate,
          unmodified write-back operation and a second time when writing the modified
          value.)
          This does not apply to the CMOS variants of the 6502.
          Implementation Specific Details
          The following sections cover traits specific to the implementation, like the
          original NMOS version and variants by MOS Technology or the CMOS version by
          Western Design Center (WDC).
