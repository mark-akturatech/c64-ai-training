# NMOS 6510 - Describes RLA operation: rotate one bit left in memory then AND accumulator with that memory ({addr} = ROL {addr}; A = A & {addr}). Explains carry behavior (carry shifted in as LSB, bit 7 shifted into Carry) and that N and Z are set according to the AND result. Includes a short example (RLA $FC,X), the equivalent instruction sequence (ROL then AND), and references to test programs (Lorenz-2.15/*.prg).

Operation: Rotate one bit left in memory, then AND accumulator with memory.

•

Carry is shifted in as LSB and bit 7 is shifted into Carry
N and Z are set according to the AND

Example:
RLA $FC,X

;37 FC

Equivalent Instructions:
ROL $FC,X
AND $FC,X
Test code: Lorenz-2.15/rlaa.prg, Lorenz-2.15/rlaax.prg,
