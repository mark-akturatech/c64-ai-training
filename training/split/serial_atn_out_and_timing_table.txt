# COMMODORE 64 - Covers SERIAL ATN OUT (Serial Attention Out): how the C64 initiates command sequences by pulling ATN low, causing all devices to listen for an address; devices must respond within a preset time or the C64 returns a device-not-present error. Includes the SERIAL BUS TIMING table with timing symbols (Tat, Th, Tne, Ts, Tv, Tf, Tr, Tbb, Tye, Tei, Try, Tpr, Ttk, Tdc, Tda, Tfr) and the notes specifying error conditions and minimum timing requirements for external talkers/listeners.

  SERIAL ATN OUT: (SERIAL ATTENTION OUT)

    The Commodore 64 uses this signal to start a command sequence for a
  device on the serial bus. When the Commodore 64 brings this signal LOW,
  all other devices on the bus start listening for the Commodore 64 to
  transmit an address. The device addressed must respond in a preset period
  of time; otherwise, the Commodore 64 will assume that the device
  addressed is not on the bus, and will return an error in the STATUS WORD.
  (See Figure 6-4).

     Notes:
     1. If maximum time exceeded, device not present error.
     2. If maximum time exceeded, EOI response required.
     3. If maximum time exceeded, frame error.
     4. Tv and Tpr minimum must be 60us for external device to be a talker.
     5. Tei minimum must be 80us for external device to be a listener.
