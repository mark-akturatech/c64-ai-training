# COMMODORE 64 - ASC(<string>): returns numeric Commodore ASCII code (0..255) for first character of string. Appendix C maps codes. Notes ILLEGAL QUANTITY error if string empty, and suggested workaround using CHR$(0) appended to string.


   ASC

  TYPE: Function-Numeric
  FORMAT: ASC(<string>)

    Action: ASC will return a number from 0 to 255 which corresponds to
  the Commodore ASCII value of the first character in the string. The table
  of Commodore ASCII values is shown in Appendix C.

  EXAMPLES OF ASC Function:

    10 PRINT ASC("Z")
    20 X = ASC("ZEBRA")
    30 J = ASC(J$)

    If there are no characters in the string, an ?ILLEGAL QUANTITY error
  results. In the third example above, if J$="", the ASC function will not
  work. The GET and GET# statement read a CHR$(0) as a null string. To
  eliminate this problem, you should add a CHR$(0) to the end of the
  string as shown below.

  EXAMPLE of ASC Function Avoiding ILLEGAL QUANTITY ERROR:

    30 J = ASC(J$ + CHR$(0))
