# Contents - Defines a bit and common synonyms (1/0, ON/OFF, SET/CLEAR, HIGH/LOW). Explains how grouping bits increases the number of representable values using 2^N, demonstrates the 4-bit example (2^4 = 16), and names a 4-bit group a 'nibble'. Introduces the idea that each bit in the group has a positional value.

BITS AND BYTES 

A bit is the smallest meaningful piece of infor- 
mation that can be stored. It can have only two 
values, 1 or 0. Other terms for these values are 
shown below: 



1 

ON OFF 

SET CLEAR 
HIGH LOW 

All of the signals inside of the computer can on- 
ly be in one of these two possible states. So how does 
the computer perform so many functions if it only 
has two states to work with? 

By grouping a collection of bits together, the 
group of bits together can have a value that is equal 
to 2 raised to the power of the number of bits in the 
group. If we grouped 4 bits together, the group could 
have 16 possible values according to the equation 
2 A N where N is the number of bits in the group: 

2 A N N=4 

2M 

2*2*2*2=16 

A grouping of 4 bits is called a nibble. Each of the 



four bits is given a value depending on its position
