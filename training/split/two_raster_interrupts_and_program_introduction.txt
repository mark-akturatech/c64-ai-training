# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Explanation that at least two raster interrupts are required to change only a portion of the screen: one interrupt to change display mode/values and another to change it back. Introduction to the sample program that divides the display into three sections (top high-res bitmap, middle text, bottom multicolor bitmap) using raster-scan interrupts.

                          Another thing that you should keep in mind is that at least two raster
                          interrupts are required if you want to change only a part of the
                          screen.  Not only must the interrupt routine change the display, but
                          it must also set up another raster interrupt that will change it back.

                          The sample program below uses a raster-scan interrupt to divide the
                          display into three sections.  The first 80 scan lines are in
                          high-resolution bitmap mode, the next 40 are regular text, and the
                          last 80 are in multicolor bitmap mode.  The screen will split this way
                          as soon as a SYS to the routine that turns on the interrupt occurs.
                          The display will stay split even after the program ends.  Only if you
                          hit the STOP and RESTORE keys together will the display return to
                          normal.
