# - C64 RAM Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $029B-$029E: overview of the two 256-byte FIFO receive and transmit buffers for RS-232. Explains dynamic wraparound buffers and that indices to start/end are used to manage buffer contents.

$029B-$029E          Byte Indices to the Beginning and End of Receive and Transmit Buffers
                     
                     The two 256-byte First In, First Out (FIFO) buffers for RS-232 data
                     reception and transmission are dynamic wraparound buffers.  This means
                     that the starting point and the ending point of the buffer can change
                     over time, and either point can be anywhere withing the buffer.  If,
                     for example, the starting point is at byte 100, the buffer will fill
                     towards byte 255, at which point it will wrap around to byte 0 again.
                     To maintain this system, the following four locations are used as
                     indices to the starting and the ending point of each buffer.
