# COMMODORE 64 - Explains LINE 70 and LINE 80: X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) positioning of the sprite using the video chip registers (POKE V for X and POKE V+1 for Y). Defines the X number as the upper-left corner of the sprite. Notes the farthest left visible X position is 24 (you can POKE values down to 0 to move it off-screen). Gives direct-mode examples: POKE V,24:POKE V+1,50 to place the sprite at the upper-left; POKE V,24:POKE V+1,229 to place it at the lower-left corner.


    LINE 70, determines the HORIZONTAL or "X" POSITION of the sprite on the
  screen. This number represents the location of the UPPER LEFT CORNER of
  the sprite. The farthest left horizontal (X) position which you can see
  on your television screen is position number 24, although you can move
  the sprite OFF THE SCREEN to position number 0.

    LINE 80 determines the VERTICAL or "Y" POSITION of the sprite. In this
  program, we placed the sprite at X (horizontal) position 24, and Y
  (vertical) position 100. To try another location, type this POKE in
  DIRECT mode and hit <RETURN>:

    POKE V,24:POKE V+1,50

    This places the sprite at the upper left corner of the screen. To move
  the sprite to the lower left corner, type this:

    POKE V,24:POKE V+1,229
