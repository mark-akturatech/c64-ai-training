# 6502 Instruction Set - Examples and expanded notes for each address mode: immediate mode examples (LDA #$07 etc.), absolute addressing (3-byte little-endian format), zero-page benefits (faster, smaller), indexed addressing details for absolute,X/Y (page crossing penalty) and zero-page,X/Y (wraparound, no penalty), pre-indexed indirect (LDA (zeropage,X)) and post-indexed indirect (LDA (zeropage),Y) examples and timing, and relative addressing exceptions (branch range -128..+127 and cycle costs on taken branches and page crossing).

           Like the absolute JMP instruction it uses a 16-bit address (3 bytes
           in total), but takes two additional CPU cycles to execute, since
           there are two additional bytes to fetch for the lookup of the
           effective jump target.
           Generally, indirect addressing is denoted by putting the lookup
           address in parenthesis.
            Mnemonic      Instruction          Lookup
            JMP ($FF82)    6C 82 FF     $FF82: C4 80
                                           PC: $80C4 (Effective Targe
           Mnemonic Example:
           JMP ($FF82) ... jump to address given in locations "$FF82" and "$FF83"
           Note: On the original NMOS 6502, the high-byte of the lookup address
           is not incremented at page boundaries. Meaning, if the low-byte of
           the lookup address is $FF, the high-byte will be fetched from $00 at
           the same page. (E.g., "JMP ($11FF)" will effectively resolve to a
           lookup at $1199 for the low-byte and $1100 for the high-byte, while
           we should expect $1200 being used for the latter.)
           This is corrected on the CMOS version of the CPU, where this behaves
           as expected, but the processor will take an extra cycle to so.
           Pre-Indexed Indirect, "(Zero-Page,X)"
           Indexed indirect address modes are generally available only for
           instructions supplying an operand to the accumulator (LDA, STA, ADC,
           SBC, AND, ORA, EOR, etc). The placement of the index register inside
           or outside of the parenthesis indicating the address lookup will
           give you clue what these instructions are doing.
           Pre-indexed indirect address mode is only available in combination
           with the X-register. It works much like the "zero-page,X" mode, but,
           after the X-register has been added to the base address, instead of
           directly accessing this, an additional lookup is performed, reading
                                                                       6502 Instruction Set
           the contents of resulting address and the next one (in LLHH little-
           endian order), in order to determine the effective address.
           Like with "zero-page,X" mode, the total instruction length is 2
           bytes, but there are two additional CPU cycles in order to fetch the
           effective 16-bit address. As "zero-page,X" mode, a lookup address
           will never overflow into the next page, but will simply wrap around
           in the zero-page.
           These instructions are useful, whenever we want to loop over a table
           of pointers to disperse addresses, or where we want to apply the
           same operation to various addresses, which we have stored as a table
           in the zero-page.
            Mnemonic    Instruction           Lookup        Data
            LDA ($70,X)   A1 70
                                 + = $0075: 23 30     $3023: A5
                          X: 05
                                                         A: A5
           Mnemonic Examples:
           LDA ($70,X) ... load the contents of the location given in addresses
                           "$0070+X" and "$0070+1+X" into A
           STA ($A2,X) ... store the contents of A in the location given in
                           addresses "$00A2+X" and "$00A3+X"
           EOR ($BA,X) ... perform an exlusive OR of the contents of A and the contents
                           of the location given in addresses "$00BA+X" and "$00BB+X"
           Post-Indexed Indirect, "(Zero-Page),Y"
           Post-indexed indirect addressing is only available in combination
           with the Y-register. As indicated by the indexing term ",Y" being
           appended to the outside of the parenthesis indicating the indirect
           lookup, here, a pointer is first read (from the given zero-page
           address) and resolved and only then the contents of the Y-register
           is added to this to give the effective address.
