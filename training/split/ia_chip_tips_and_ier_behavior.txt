# MACHINE - Practical tips: many IA addresses behave differently on read vs write. Turning off interrupt flags can require unintuitive stores. The IER (interrupt enable register) often uses the high bit to toggle enable/disable actions; examples given: Commodore 64 store $7F to $DC0C (or $DC0D) to disable interrupts, store $81 to re-enable; VIC-20 and PET equivalents are provided earlier. Warns that disabling interrupts via POKE may disable keyboard and should not be done carelessly.


Tips on IA Chips
----------------

Many addresses within an IA chip have a different meaning, depending on
whether they are being written to (stored) or read (loaded).  Watch for this
when you are reading the chip specifications.

Often, the action required to turn an interrupt flag off is odd.  It looks
like the kind of thing you should do to turn the flag on.  Keep in mind that
a flag may be turned on only by the external activity to which it is linked.
So, although it may seem odd to turn the flag in bit zero off by storing a
value of 1 (which would seem to want to turn bit zero on), don't worry.
You'll get used to it.

The IER (interrupt enable register) is often a source of problems.  In many
cases, the high bit of a value we are storing has a special meaning:  if it's
set, the other bits will cause the appropriate interrupt connections to turn
on; if it's clear, the other bits will cause the appropriate interrupt
connections to be turned off.  You may recall that we shut off the Commodore
64 interrupt by storing $7F into address $DC0D.  This may seem odd:  we're
storing a binary value of $01111111, which might seem to be turning bits on.
In fact, the high bit of zero signals that all the remaining bits are "turn
off" signals; so the value causes all interrupts to be blocked.
