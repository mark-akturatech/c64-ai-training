# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - D016 Bit 4: Multicolor mode behavior. In character (text) mode: characters with color nybble <8 display normally; those >=8 display in multicolor with bit-pair encoding mapping to 4 color sources (00 background0, 01 bg register1, 10 bg register2, 11 color RAM nybble). If both multicolor and bitmap enabled, this produces multicolor bitmap mode with color sources: 00=Background Color Register 0, 01=upper nybble of Video Matrix, 10=lower nybble of Video Matrix, 11=Color RAM nybble. Impact on plotting and resolution described.

                          Bit 4.  This bit selects multicolor graphics.  The effect of setting
                          this bit to 1 depends on whether or not the bitmap graphics mode is
                          also enabled.

                          If you are not in bitmap mode, and you select multicolor text
                          character mode by setting this bit to 1, characters with a color
                          nybble whose value is less than 8 are displayed normally.  There will
                          be one background color and one foreground color.  But each dot of a
                          character with a color nybble whose value is over 7 can have any one
                          of four different colors.

                          The two colors in the Background Control Registers 1 and 2 (53282-3,
                          $D022-3) are available in addition to the colors supplied by the Color
                          RAM.  The price of these extra colors is a reduction in horizontal
                          resolution.  Instead of each bit controlling one dot, in multicolor
                          mode a pair of bits control the color of a larger dot.  A pattern of
                          11 will light it with the color from the lower three bits of color
                          RAM.  Patterns of 01 and 10 will select the colors from Background
                          Color Registers 1 and 2, respectively, for the double-width dot.

                          You can see the effect that setting this bit has by typing in the
                          following BASIC command line:

                              POKE 53270,PEEK(53280)OR16:PRINT CHR$(149)"THIS IS MULTICOLOR MODE"

                          It is obvious from this example that the normal set of text characters
                          was not made to be used in multicolor mode.  In order to take
                          advantage of this mode, you will need to design custom four-color
                          characters.  For more information, see the alternate entry for 53248
                          ($D000), the Character Generator ROM.

                          If the multicolor and bitmap enable bits are both set to 1, the result
                          is a multicolor bitmap mode.  As in multicolor text mode, pairs of
                          graphics data bits are used to set each dot in a 4 by 8 matrix to one
                          of four colors.  This results in a reduction of the horizontal
                          resolution to 160 double-wide dots across.  But while text multicolor
                          mode allows only one of the four colors to be set individually for
                          each 4 by 8 dot area, bitmap multicolor mode allows up to three
                          different colors to be individually selected in each 4 by 8 dot area.
                          The source of the dot color for each bit-pair combination is shown
                          below:

                          00 Background Color Register 0 (53281, $D021)
                          01 Upper four bits of Video Matrix
                          10 Lower four bits of Video Matrix
                          11 Color RAM nybble (area starts at 55296 ($D800))

                          The fact that bit-pairs are used in this mode changes the strategy for
                          plotting somewhat.  In order to find the byte BY in which the desired
                          bit-pair resides, you must multiply the horizontal position X, which
                          has a value of 0- 159, by 2, and then use the same formula as for
