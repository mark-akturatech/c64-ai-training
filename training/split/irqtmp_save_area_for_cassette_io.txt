# ********* - IRQTMP (locations 671-672, $29F-$2A0): save area for IRQ vector during cassette (tape) I/O. Cassette read/write routines are IRQ-driven; they save the current IRQ vector here before changing it to their own routine. Notes that keyboard scanning, STOP-key check, and clock update are suspended during tape I/O.

671-672       $29F-$2A0      IRQTMP
SAve Area for IRQ Vector During Cassette I/O

The routines that read and write tape data are driven by an IRQ
interrupt.  In order to hook one of these routines into the interrupt,
the RAM IRQ vector at 788-789 ($314-$315) must be changed to point to
the address at which it starts.  Before that change is made, the old
IRQ vector address is saved at these locations, so that after the tape
I/O is finished, the interrupt that is used for scanning the keyboard,
checking the stop key, and updating the clock can be restored.

You will note that all of the above functions will be suspended during
tape I/O.
