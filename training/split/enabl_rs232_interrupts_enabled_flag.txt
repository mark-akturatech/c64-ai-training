# ********* - ENABL (location 673, $2A1): holds active NMI interrupt flag byte from CIA #2 Interrupt Control Register ($DD0D). Bit meanings: Bit4 (16) System waiting for receiver edge, Bit1 (2) System receiving data, Bit0 (1) System transmitting data. Used to indicate RS-232 interrupt-driven operation states.

673           $2A1           ENABL
RS-232 Interrupts Enabled

This location holds the active NMI interrupt flag byte from CIA #2
Interrupt Control Register (56589, $DD0D).  The bit values for this
flag are as follows:

Bit 4: 1 (bit value of 16) = System is Waiting for Receiver Edge
Bit 1: 1 (bit value of 2)  = System is Receiving Data
Bit 0: 1 (bit value of 1)  = System is Transmitting Data
