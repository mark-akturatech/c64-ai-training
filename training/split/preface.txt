# NMOS 6510 - Historical background on research into illegal/undocumented 6502 opcodes, notes about misinformation, reference to Wolfgang Lorenz test suite, and document authorship/date.

When some time later some of these opcodes were documented by various book authors and
magazines, a lot of misinformation was spread and a number of weird myths were born. It took
another few years until some brave souls started to systematically investigate each and every
opcode, and until the mid 90s that Wolfgang Lorenz came up with his test suite that finally
contained elaborated test programs for them.
Still, a few opcodes were considered witchcraft for a while (the so called 'unstable' ones), until other
people finally de-capped an actual CPU and solved the remaining riddles.
This document tries to present the current state of the art in a readable form, and is in large parts the
result of pasting existing documents together and editing them (see References)

Scope of this Document
To make things simple, the rest of this document refers specifically to the MOS6510 (and the
CSG8500) in the Commodore 64, and to the CSG8502 found in the Commodore 128.
However, most of the document applies to MOS6502 as well. Also MOS Technology licensed
Rockwell and Synertek to second source the 6502 microprocessor and support components,
