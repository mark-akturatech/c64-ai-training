# byRiclianll - INPUT# and GET# to read DOS responses from the command channel: SYNTAX: INPUT# file#, varlist or GET# file#, varlist. INPUT# reads through the next carriage return (used mainly for error status monitoring); GET# reads a single byte (commonly used in direct-access programming). Notes: correct keywords are INPUT# and GET# (no space before '#'); they cannot be used in immediate mode.

3.  Reading  DOS  messages  using  a  GET#  or  an  INPUT*  statement. 

You  may  use  either  an  INPUT#  or  a  GET*  statement  to  read  the  command  channel 
and  access  any  messages  or  data  prepared  for  the  computer  by  the  DOS.  Both  INPUT* 
and  GET*  statements  are  BASIC  commands.  They  look  like  this: 

SYNTAX:      INPUT*  file#,    variable  list 
GET#  file#,   variable  list 

EXAMPLE:    INPUT#   15,    EN,    EM*,    ET,  ES 
GET#   15,  A* 

where 

file*  =  the  logical  file  number  you  used  when  you  opened  the  command  channel 

variable  list  =  one  or  more  variable  names  separated  by  commas 


NOTE:  As  was  noted  for  PRINT*  above,  the  BASIC  statements  are  INPUT*  and  GET*, 
not  INPUT  *  and  GET  *.  You  must  not  put  a  space  before  the  *  sign.  Spaces  following 
the  *  sign  are  always  optional.  Neither  the  INPUT*  statement  nor  the  GET*  state- 
ment can  be  used  in  immediate  mode  (typed  and  executed  directly  from  the  keyboard). 
They  must  be  included  within  a  program. 

The  INPUT*  command  and  the  GET*  command  operate  in  much  the  same  way  as  the 
more  familiar  INPUT  and  GET  commands.  INPUT*  always  reads  as  far  as  the  next 
carriage  return  character  while  GET*  reads  a  single  byte  of  information.  Generally,  GET* 
is  used  in  direct-access  programming  and  INPUT*  is  used  only  for  monitoring  the  drive's 
error  status  as  indicated  immediately  below.
