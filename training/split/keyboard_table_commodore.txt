# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - The Commodore-key decode table (third keyboard table). Provides the mapping of keys to CBM/Commodore-specific characters (alternate symbol set). Matrix format is the same (row -> $DC00, column <- $DC01). Ends with a free byte ($FF).

                                *** KEYBOARD 3 - COMMODORE
                                This is the third of four keyboard decode tables. The
                                ASCII code for the key pressed is at the intersection of
                                the ro (written to $dc00) and the column (read from
                                $dc01). The matrix values are shown below.
