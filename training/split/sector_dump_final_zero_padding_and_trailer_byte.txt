# byRiclianll - The dump tail: a long contiguous run of 00 padding culminating in the final non-zero trailer byte. This chunk covers repeated zero lines from the mid-region through the end of the captured dump and concludes with the single non-zero byte '67' (line 12900) followed by the final blank lines. Illustrates how the example terminates with persistent zero padding and a final trailing byte.
