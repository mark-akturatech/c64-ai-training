# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Initialises VIC-II: sets input/output devices (screen as output, keyboard as input) and writes a table of initialisation values into VIC-II registers via a loop that copies from a ROM table into the chip's registers.

                                *** initialise the vic chip
.,E5A0 A9 03    LDA #$03        set the screen as the output device
.,E5A2 85 9A    STA $9A         save the output device number
.,E5A4 A9 00    LDA #$00        set the keyboard as the input device
.,E5A6 85 99    STA $99         save the input device number
.,E5A8 A2 2F    LDX #$2F        set the count/index
.,E5AA BD B8 EC LDA $ECB8,X     get a vic ii chip initialisation value
.,E5AD 9D FF CF STA $CFFF,X     save it to the vic ii chip
.,E5B0 CA       DEX             decrement the count/index
.,E5B1 D0 F7    BNE $E5AA       loop if more to do
.,E5B3 60       RTS
