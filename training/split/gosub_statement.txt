# ********* - GOSUB ($A883) — Perform GOSUB: pushes the current text-character and current-line pointers and a block-type identifier (141, $8D) onto the stack to mark a GOSUB return point, then invokes GOTO to jump to the subroutine line.

Perform GOSUB

This statement pushes the pointers to the current text character and
current line onto the stack, along with a constant 141 ($8D) which
identifies the block as saved GOSUB information to be used by RETURN.
The GOTO is called.
