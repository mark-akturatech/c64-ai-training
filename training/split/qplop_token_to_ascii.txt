# ********* - QPLOP: subroutine used by LIST to convert one-byte program tokens back to their ASCII text representations. Vectored through RAM at $306 so newly added commands can be listed by detouring this vector.

42775         $A717          QPLOP
Print BASIC Tokens as ASCII Characters

This is the part of the LIST routine that chagnes one-byte program
tokens back to their ASCII text characters.  The routine is vectored
through RAM at 774 ($306), so it is possible to list out new command
words that you have added by changing this vector to detour through
your own routine.
