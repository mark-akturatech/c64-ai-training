# COMMODORE 64 - Techniques for moving a sprite on the screen. Shows a smooth horizontal sweep (sample lines 50 and 55) that POKEs Y position (V+5), iterates X positions (V+4) across 0–255 and uses POKE V+16 to set the RIGHT X position for wrap-around. Explains looping behavior and how to remove GOTO to make the sprite move only once. Includes a back-and-forth example (FOR with STEP -1 and reversal using POKE V+16) and a single-line vertical scrolling example (POKE V+4,24:FOR Y=0TO255:POKE V+5,Y:NEXT). Also documents erasing prior lines (erasing earlier numbered BASIC lines) to replace movement code.

  MOVING YOUR SPRITE ON THE SCREEN

    Now that you've created your sprite, let's do some interesting things
  with it. To move your sprite smoothly across the screen, add these two
  lines to your program:

    50 POKE V+5,100:FOR X=24TO255:POKE V+4,X:NEXT:POKE V+16,4
    55 FOR X=0TO65:POKE V+4,X:NEXT X:POKE V+16,0:GOTO 50

    LINE 50 POKEs the Y POSITION at 100 (try 50 or 229 instead for
  variety). Then it sets up a FOR... NEXT loop which POKEs the sprite into
  X position 0 to X position 255, in order. When it reaches the 255th
  position, it POKEs the RIGHT X POSITION (POKE V+16,4) which is required
  to cross to the right side of the screen.

    LINE 55 has a FOR... NEXT loop which continues to POKE the sprite in
  the last 65 positions on the screen. Note that the X value was reset to
  zero but because you used the RIGHT X setting (POKE V+16,2) X starts over
  on the right side of the screen.
    This line keeps going back to itself (GOTO 50). If you just want the
  sprite to move ONCE across the screen and disappear, then take out
  GOTO50.

    Here's a line which moves the sprite BACK AND FORTH:

    50 POKE V+5,100:FOR X=24TO255:POKE V+4,X:NEXT:POKE V+16,4:
       FOR X=0TO65: POKE V+4,X: NEXT X
    55 FOR X=65TO0 STEP-1:POKE V+4,X:NEXT:POKE V+16,0: FOR
       X=255TO24 STEP-1: POKE V+4,X:NEXT
    60 GOTO 50

  Do you see how these programs work? This program is the same as the
  previous one, except when it reaches the end of the right side of the
  screen, it REVERSES ITSELF and goes back in the other direction. That is
  what the STEP-1 accomplishes... it tells the program to POKE the sprite
  into X values from 65 to 0 on the right side of the screen, then from 255
  to 0 on the left side of the screen, STEPping backwards minus-1 position
  at a time.

  VERTICAL SCROLLING

    This type of sprite movement is called "scrolling." To scroll your
  sprite up or down in the Y position, you only have to use ONE LINE. ERASE
  LINES 50 and 55 by typing the line numbers by themselves and hitting
  <RETURN> like this:

    50 <RETURN>
    60 <RETURN>

  Now enter LINE 50 again as follows:

    50 POKE V+4,24:FOR Y=0TO255:POKE V+5,Y:NEXT
