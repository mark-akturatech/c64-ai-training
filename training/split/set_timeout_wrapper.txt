# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Wrapper at $FFA2 that JMPs to $FE21 to set serial bus timeout flag. Bit 7 in accumulator controls enable/disable of timeouts.

                                *** set timeout on serial bus
                                this routine sets the timeout flag for the serial bus. When the timeout flag is
                                set, the computer will wait for a device on the serial port for 64 milliseconds.
                                If the device does not respond to the computer's DAV signal within that time the
                                computer will recognize an error condition and leave the handshake sequence. When
                                this routine is called and the accumulator contains a 0 in bit 7, timeouts are
                                enabled. A 1 in bit 7 will disable the timeouts.
                                NOTE: The the timeout feature is used to communicate that a disk file is not found
                                on an attempt to OPEN a file.
