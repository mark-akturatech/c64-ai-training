# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Entry point to start a tape write: calls set-pointer (JSR $F7D7), sets the write lead cycle count ($AB) (20 cycles or other value depending on entry), waits for PLAY/RECORD (JSR $F838), exits if STOP pressed, disables interrupts (SEI), loads an interrupt enable constant and selects the tape-write leader vector index (LDX #$08). Control then falls into the shared tape read/write handler.
