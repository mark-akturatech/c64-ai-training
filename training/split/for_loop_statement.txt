# COMMODORE 64 - FOR <variable> = <start> TO <limit> [STEP <increment>]: loop counter construct. Explains behavior: initialization, NEXT increments (default STEP +1), comparison to limit to decide continuation (exceeding limit ends loop; if step negative, test reversed), loop executes at least once. Example program counting with FOR/NEXT and a note that a loop always executes at least once. Example start: 'FOR L = 100 TO 0 STEP -1'.

  FOR ... TO ... [STEP ...

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: FOR <variable> = <start> TO <limit> [ STEP <increment> ]

    Action: This is a special BASIC statement that lets you easily use a
  variable as a counter. You must specify certain parameters: the
  floating-point variable name, its starting value, the limit of the count,
  and how much to add during each cycle.

    Here is a simple BASIC program that counts from 1 to 10, PRINTing
  each number and ENDing when complete, and using no FOR statements:

    100 L = 1
    110 PRINT L
    120 L = 1 + 1
    130 IF L <= 10 THEN 110
    140 END

  Using the FOR statement, here is the same program:

    100 FOR L = 1 TO 10
    110 PRINT L
    120 NEXT L
    130 END

    As you can see, the program is shorter and easier to understand using
  the FOR statement.
    When the FOR statement is executed, several operations take place.
  The <start> value is placed in the <variable> being used in the
  counter. In the example above, a I is placed in L.
    When the NEXT statement is reached, the <increment> value is added to
  the <variable>. If a STEP was not included, the <increment> is set to
  + 1. The first time the program above hits line 120, 1 is added to L,
  so the new value of L is 2.
    Now the value in the <variable> is compared to the <limit>. If the
  <limit> has not been reached yet, the program G0es TO the line after
  the original FOR statement. In this case, the value of 2 in L is less
  than the limit of 10, so it GOes TO line 110.
    Eventually, the value of <limit> is exceeded by the <variable>. At
  that time, the loop is concluded and the program continues with the line
  following the NEXT statement. In our example, the value of L reaches
  11, which exceeds the limit of 10, and the program goes on with line
  130.
    When the value of <increment> is positive, the <variable> must
  exceed the <limit>, and when it is negative it must become less than
  the <limit>.
