# COMMODORE 64 - Implied addressing mode: instructions that act on implied registers or operations without explicit operands (e.g., PHA, PLA, PHP, PLP). Also establishes shorthand notation for registers used from here on: A (Accumulator), X (X register), Y (Y register), S (Stack pointer), P (Processor status).

    Up to this point, we have covered immediate, zero page, and absolute
  mode instructions. We have also covered, but have not really talked
  about, the "implied" mode. The implied mode means that information is
  implied by an instruction itself. In other words, what registers, flags,
  and memory the instruction is referring to. The examples we have seen are
  PHA, PLA, PHP, and PLP, which refer to stack processing and the
  accumulator and status registers, respectively.

  | NOTE: The X register will be referred to as X from now on, and        |
  | similarly A (accumulator), Y (Y index register), S (stack pointer),   |
  | and P (processor status).                                             |
