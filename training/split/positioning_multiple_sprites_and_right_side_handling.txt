# COMMODORE 64 - Demonstrates positioning multiple sprites (0,1,2) with different colors and pointers, using POKE loops to fill sprite data and POKE V+21 to enable multiple sprites. Discusses showing sprites beyond the 255th X position by setting appropriate bit in V+16 for the sprite (see RIGHT X row in chart) and then assigning new X (starting at 0 as 256th). Example shows POKE V+16,1:POKE V,24:POKE V+1,75 to place sprite 0 on the right side area.

  This POKE starts the X numbering over again from 0 at the 256th position
  (Example: POKE V+16,PEEK(V+16)OR 1 and POKE V,1 must be included to place
  sprite 0 at the 257th pixel across the screen.) To get back to the left
  side X positions you have to TURN OFF the control setting by typing
  POKE V+16,PEEK(V+16)AND 254.

  POSITIONING MULTIPLE SPRITES ON THE SCREEN

    Here's a program which defines THREE DIFFERENT SPRITES (0, 1 and 2) in
  different colors and places them in different positions on the screen:

start tok64 page160.prg
  10 print"{clear}":v=53248:fors=832to895:pokes,255:next
  20 form=2040to2042:pokem,13:next
  30 pokev+21,7
  40 pokev+39,1:pokev+40,7:pokev+41,8
  50 pokev,24:pokev+1,50
  60 pokev+2,12:pokev+3,229
  70 pokev+4,255:pokev+5,50
stop tok64

    For convenience, all 3 sprites have been defined as solid squares,
  getting their data from the same place. The important lesson here is how
  the 3 sprites are positioned. The white sprite 0 is at the top lefthand
  corner. The yellow sprite 1 is at the bottom lefthand corner but HALF the
  sprite is OFF THE SCREEN (remember, 24 is the leftmost X position in the
  viewing area... an X position less than 24 puts all or part of the sprite
  off the screen and we used an X position 12 here which put the sprite
  halfway off the screen). Finally, the orange sprite 2 is at the RIGHT X
  LIMIT (position 255)... but what if you want to display a sprite in the
  area to the RIGHT of X position 255?

  DISPLAYING A SPRITE BEYOND THE 255TH X-POSITION

    Displaying a sprite beyond the 255th X position requires a special POKE
  which SETS the most significant bit of the X position and starts over at
  the 256th pixel position across the screen. Here's how it works...
    First, you POKE V+16 with the number for the sprite you're using (check
  the "RIGHT X" row in the X-Y chart... we'll use sprite 0). Now we assign
  an X position, keeping in mind that the X counter starts over from 0 at
  the 256th position on the screen. Change line 50 to read as follows:
    50 POKE V+16,1:POKE V,24:POKE V+1,75

  This line POKEs V+ 16 with the number required to "open up" the right
  side of the screen... the new X position 24 for sprite 0 now begins 24
  pixels to the RIGHT of position 255. To check the right edge of the
  screen, change line 60 to:

    60 POKE V+16,1:POKE V,65:POKE V+1,75

    Some experimentation with the settings in the sprite chart will give
  you the settings you need to position and move sprites on the left and
  right sides of the screen. The section on "moving sprites" will also
  increase your understanding of how sprite positioning works.
