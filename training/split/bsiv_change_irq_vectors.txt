# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL ROM Disassembly (English, "CBM") - BSIV subroutine and table-driven IRQ vector changer. Uses X as selector (.X = 8 for write zeros, 10 for write data, 12 restore keyscan, 14 read data). Loads two bytes from a table (BSIT-8 + X) and stores them into the IRQ vector at $0314/$0315 (CINV/CINV+1), then RTS.

                                ; BSIV - SUBROUTINE TO CHANGE IRQ VECTORS
                                ;  ENTRYS - .X = 8 WRITE ZEROS TO TAPE
                                ;           .X = 10 WRITE DATA TO TAPE
                                ;           .X = 12 RESTORE TO KEYSCAN
                                ;           .X = 14 READ DATA FROM TAPE
