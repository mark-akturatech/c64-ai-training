# Kick Assembler - Describes shorthand for naming memory blocks while switching segments by placing a text string after .segment (e.g., .segment Code "My Code" is same as .segment Code then .memblock "My Code").

rts

text:

.segment Data "Static Text"
.text "hello world!"
.byte $ff

}

You will now get a memory map like this, when you use the -showmem’ option:
Code-segment:
$0900-$0906 Main
$0907-$0913 Color Setup
