CIA #1 Data Direction Registers A and B

These Data Direction Registers control the direction of data flow over
Data Ports A and B.  Each bit controls the direction of the data on
the corresponding bit of the port.  If teh bit of the Direction
Register is set to a 1, the corresponding Data Port bit will be used
for data output.  If the bit is set to a 0, the corresponding Data
Port bit will be used for data input.  For example, Bit 7 of Data
Direction Register A controls Bit 7 of Data Port A, and if that
direction bit is set to 0, Bit 7 of Data Port A will be used for data
input.  If the direction bit is set to 1, however, data Bit 7 on Port
A will be used for data output.

The default setting for Data Direction Register A is 255 (all
outputs), and for Data Direction Register B it is 0 (all inputs).
This corresponds to the setting used when reading the keyboard (the
keyboard column number is written to Data Port A, and the row number
is then read in Data Port B).
