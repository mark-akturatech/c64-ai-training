# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL ROM Disassembly (English, "CBM") - NLOAD entry: store verify flag (VERCK) and clear STATUS. Loads device number FA and validates it (disallow keyboard and screen loads). Branches to appropriate error handlers for bad device numbers, or to tape handling if FA indicates a tape device (carry set).
