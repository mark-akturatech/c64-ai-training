# MACHINE - STRING THING (and STRING THING V64): a simple machine-language utility POKEable from BASIC to substitute for INPUT#. Overcomes INPUT# limitations (80-character limit, comma/colon splitting, loss of leading spaces). STRING THING reads everything up to RETURN or EOF; it's pure BASIC that POKEs machine code into the cassette buffer and uses the first variable as an input buffer.

                                                                        :315:

  STRING THING     - BASIC, for PET/CBM
  STRING THING V64 - BASIC, for VIC-20, Commodore 64
  ]SAMPLE FILE     - for use with STRING THING

A simple machine language program, POKEable directly from BASIC, to
substitute for an INPUT# statement.

INPUT# has several limitations that sometimes make it awkward for use with
files:

  - No more than 80 characters may be read.
  - The comma or colon character will break up input.
  - Leading spaces will disappear.

STRING THING reads everything up to the next RETURN or end of file.  It is
pure BASIC, but POKEs machine language into the cassette buffer area.  It
finds the first variable and uses it as an input buffer.
