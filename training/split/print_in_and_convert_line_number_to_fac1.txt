# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Print the ' IN ' message and print the current line number: set up pointer to the literal ' IN ', JSR to print a null-terminated string, load the current line number bytes into X and A, store them as FAC1 mantissa bytes, set the FAC1 exponent (via JSR to the exponent setter) and call the FAC1->ASCII conversion routine, then JSR to print the resulting null-terminated string.

                                *** do " IN " line number message
.,BDC2 A9 71    LDA #$71        set " IN " pointer low byte

.,BDCB A6 39    LDX $39         get the current line number low byte

                                *** print XA as unsigned integer

.,BDD4 20 49 BC JSR $BC49       set exponent = X, clear mantissa 4 and 3 and normalise
                                FAC1
