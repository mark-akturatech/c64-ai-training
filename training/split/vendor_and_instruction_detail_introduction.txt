# 6502 Instruction Set - Vendor credit (MOS Technology) and the beginning of '6502 Instructions in Detail' section. Starts ADC instruction detailed opcode table and flags summary (A + M + C -> A, flags N Z C I D V) with addressing forms and opcodes/cycles listing for ADC. Begin AND instruction details following ADC.

           Like with "zero-page,Y" mode, the total instruction length is 2
           bytes, but there it takes an additional CPU cycles to resolve and
           index the 16-bit pointer. As with "absolute,X" mode, the effective
           address may overflow into the next page, in the case of which the
           execution uses an extra CPU cycle.
           These instructions are useful, wherever we want to perform lookups
           on varying bases addresses or whenever we want to loop over tables,
           the base address of which we have stored in the zero-page.
                                                                         6502 Instruction Set
            Mnemonic    Instruction         Lookup             Data
            LDA ($70),Y    B1 70    $0070: 43 35
                                                    + = $3553: 23
                                            Y: 10
                                                            A: 23
           Mnemonic Examples:
           LDA ($70),Y ... add the contents of the Y-register to the pointer provided in
                            "$0070" and "$0071" and load the contents of this address into A
           STA ($A2),Y ... store the contents of A in the location given by the pointer
                            in "$00A2" and "$00A3" plus the contents of the Y-register
           EOR ($BA),Y ... perform an exlusive OR of the contents of A and the address
                            given by the addition of Y to the pointer in "$00BA" and "$00BB"
           Relative Addressing (Conditional Branching)
           This final address mode is exlusive to conditional branch
           instructions, which branch in the execution path depending on the
           state of a given CPU flag. Here, the instruction provides only a
           relative offset, which is added to the contents of the program
           counter (PC) as it points to the immediate next instruction. The
           relative offset is a signed single byte value in two's complement
           encoding (giving a range of −128…+127), which allows for branching
           up to half a page forwards and backwards.
           On the one hand, this makes these instructions compact, fast and
           relocatable at the same time. On the other hand, we have to mind
           that our branch target is no farther away than half a memory page.
           Generally, an assembler will take care of this and we only have to
           provide the target address, not having to worry about relative
           addressing.
           These instructions are always of 2 bytes length and perform in 2 CPU
           cycles, if the branch is not taken (the condition resolving to
           'false'), and 3 cycles, if the branch is taken (when the condition
           is true). If a branch is taken and the target is on a different
           page, this adds another CPU cycle (4 in total).
              PC         Mnemonic    Instruction             Target
            $1000       BEQ $1005       F0 03
                                                Offset
            $1002
                                                +        PC: $1005
                  PC pointing to next instruction
           Mnemonic Examples:
           (Examples are provided in usual assembler format. Mind how these
           look much like instructions in absolute address mode.)
                                                                         6502 Instruction Set
            BEQ $1005 ... branch to location "$1005", if the zero flag is set.
                          if the current address is $1000, this will give an offset of $03.
            BCS $08C4 ... branch to location "$08C4", if the carry flag is set.
                          if the current address is $08D4, this will give an offset of $EE (−$12).
            BCC $084A ... branch to location "$084A", if the carry flag is clear.
