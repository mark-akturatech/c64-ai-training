# byRiclianll - Defines an unclosed file type (file-type byte begins with '*', e.g., *SEQ, *PRG) indicating the file was never properly closed. Lists common causes: (1) disk-full during save/write, (2) bad sector encountered during write, (3) file left open because the program forgot to CLOSE or the program was aborted (RUN/STOP or RUN/STOP+RESTORE), and (4) the program had a syntax error returning to immediate mode. References Chapter 8 for recovery procedures.


A  file  type  that  begins  with  a  *  is  unclosed:  *SEQ,  *PRG,  etc.  It  was  never  closed  proper- 
ly. This  can  happen  for  a  variety  of  reasons: 

1.  The  diskette  may  have  been  at  its  physical  capacity  and  a  disk-full  situation  occurred 
during  a  save  or  write  to  a  diskette. 

2.  A  bad  sector  may  have  been  encountered  during  a  write  to  a  diskette.

3.  The  file  may  have  been  left  open  following  a  write  operation  because  you  forgot  to 
CLOSE  the  file,  or  you  aborted  the  program  by  hitting  either  the  RUN/STOP  key 
or  the  RUN/STOP  and  the  RESTORE  keys. 

4.  Your  program  had  a  syntax  error  in  it  and  the  BASIC  interpreter  returned  you  to 
immediate  mode. 

(See  Chapter  8  about  how  to  recover  an  unclosed  file.)
