# COMMODORE 64 - Explanation of the DATA DIRECTION REGISTER (DDR) for the USER port at location 56579 ($DD03). Describes that each of the eight PORT lines has a corresponding DDR bit: 1 = output, 0 = input. Includes a bit-number/value example (bits 7..0 with VALUE: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0) and shows converting the bit pattern into a decimal value for use with PEEK/POKE (2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 = 56). Notes that PEEK/POKE require 0-255 decimal values.

    The DATA DIRECTION REGISTER has its location at 56579 ($DD03 hex). Each
  of the eight lines in the PORT has a BIT in the eight-bit DATA DIRECTION
  REGISTER (DDR) which controls whether that line will be an input or an
  output. If a bit in the DDR is a ONE, the corresponding line of the PORT
  will be an OUTPUT. If a bit in the DDR is a ZERO, the corresponding line
  of the PORT will be an INPUT. For example, if bit 3 of the DDR is set to
  1, then line 3 of the PORT will be an output. A further example:
    If the DDR is set like this:

                          BIT #: 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
                          VALUE: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0

  You can see that lines 5,4, and 3 will be outputs since those bits are
  ones. The rest of the lines will be inputs, since those lines are zeros.
    To PEEK or POKE the USER port, it is necessary to use both the DDR and
  the PORT itself.
    Remember that the PEEK and POKE statements want a number from 0-255.
  The numbers given in the example must be translated into decimal before
  they can be used. The value would be:

                     2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 = 32 + 16 + 8 = 56

  Notice that the bit # for the DDR is the same number that = 2 raised to
  a power to turn the bit value on.

                      (16 = 2^4=2*2*2*2, 8 = 2^3=2*2*2)
