# Contents - Explains the C64 standard text mode (40x25 = 1000 characters), where the screen text bytes are stored by default at $0400, and how the VIC's VIDBAS register ($D018) upper 4 bits select the text memory base (on $0400 boundaries). Also describes that each text byte indexes the character generator (256 possible patterns) and introduces the VIDBAS lower 4 bits as selecting the character-generator/graphics memory area.

STANDARD TEXT MODE 

When the Commodore 64 is first turned on, it 
powers up in its standard text mode. When in this 
mode, the screen is arranged as 40 characters by 
25 lines. This gives a total of 1000 characters that 
can be displayed on the screen at any one time. The 
character to display in each position can be found 
in the 1000 bytes of RAM starting at $0400. If you 
want, you can instruct the VIC chip to use a dif- 
ferent area of memory to find the text to be 
displayed. The upper four bits of the VIDBAS 
register ($D018) control where the VIC chip will 



24 



find the text. Text memory will always be found on 
$0400 boundaries. 

Each byte in the text memory area is used as 
an index into a character generator section of 
memory. Since a byte can have 256 values, each 
position on the screen can display one of 256 pat- 
terns. When the Commodore 64 is powered up, the 
graphics information that the text memory 



references is in the character generator ROM. The 
VIC chip can be instructed to use a different area 
of memory as the character generator by changing 
the lower four bits of the VIDBAS register ($D018). 
This section of memory will be referred to as 
graphics memory, as the information can be of any 
type of graphics, not necessarily text.
