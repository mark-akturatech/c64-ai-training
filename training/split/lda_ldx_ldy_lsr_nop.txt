# 6502 Instruction Set - LDA (load accumulator) opcode table (immediate, zpg, zpg,X, abs, abs,X/Y, (indirect,X), (indirect),Y). LDX and LDY instruction tables and addressing modes. LSR (logical shift right) details for accumulator and memory forms and opcodes. NOP instruction brief with opcode EA. ORA (logical OR with accumulator) entry begins at end of chunk.
