# byRiclianll - Introduction to DOS checksums: single-byte checksum (hashtotal) computed by XOR (EOR) of bytes to detect read errors for header and data blocks; difference from tape redundancy. Explains the EOR operation and notes that DOS EORs bytes prior to GCR conversion.

7.2  Checksums 


The  only  remaining  concern  we  have  at  this  time  is  how  we  compute  a  checksum.  Unhke 
tape  storage  where  a  program  file  is  recorded  twice  in  succession,  data  is  recorded  on 
diskette  only  once.  In  other  words,  there  is  no  cyclic  redundancy.  Checksum  comes  to 
the  rescue.  A  single  byte  checksum  or  hashtotal  is  used  by  the  DOS  to  determine  whether 
or  not  an  error  occurred  during  a  read  of  a  header  block  or  a  data  block.  A  checksum 
is  derived  by  Exclusive-ORing  (EOR)  bytes  together.  Two  bytes  are  EORed  together 
at  one  time  by  comparing  their  respective  bits.  The  four  possible  EOR  bit  combinations 
are  shown  in  the  following  truth  table. 

EOR  Truth  Table 


0  EOR  0  =  0 

0  EOR  1  =  1 

1  EOR  0  =  1 
1  EOR  1=0
