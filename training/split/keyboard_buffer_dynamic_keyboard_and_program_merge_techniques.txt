# ********* - Keyboard buffer / queue (KEYD, 631-640 / $277-$280): FIFO behavior, interrupt deposit of ASCII codes, 10-character capacity (limited by XMAX at $289), behavior when full, interaction with GET and INPUT, and clearing the buffer via POKE 198 ($C6). The dynamic keyboard technique: programmatically POKEing PETASCII characters and count into the keyboard buffer to simulate typing (examples: printing statements to be entered, homing cursor, executing END to cause automatic entry). Examples and uses: adding/modifying/deleting program lines at runtime, entering numbered DATA statements, merging/telnetting ASCII program files. Procedures to create ASCII program files (OPEN/CMD/LIST) for tape and disk are shown, plus a full example merge program (lines 60000–60180) that reads an ASCII file and injects it into the keyboard buffer; notes on saving before running and how to merge additional programs.

631-640       $277-$280      KEYD
Keyboard Buffer (Queue)

This buffer, sometimes also referred to as the keyboard queue, holds
the ASCII values of the characters entered from the keyboard.  The
interrupt routine which scans the keyboard deposits a character here
each time a key is pressed.  When BASIC sees that there are characters
waiting, it removes and prints them, one by one, in the order in which
they were entered.

This kind of a buffer is known as FIFO, for First In, First Out.  The
buffer will hold up to ten characters, allowing you to type faster
than the computer prints characters, without losing characters.  The
maximum number of characters this buffer can hold at one time is ten
(as determined by the value at 649 ($289)).  Characters entered after
the buffer is full will be ignored.

The commands GET and INPUT retrieve characters from this buffer.  If
one of these is executed while there are already characters waiting in
the buffer, those characters will be fetched as if they were part of
the data being input.  To prevent this from happening, you can clear
the buffer by POKEing a 0 into location 198 ($C6), which holds the
number of characters that are waiting in the buffer.

One of the most interesting and useful techniques for programming
Commodore computers is to have a program simulate direct entry of
commands from the keyboard.  This dynamic keyboard trick is achieved
by first POKEing PETASCII characters, usually cursor movement
characters and carriage returns, into the buffer, and setting location
198 ($C6) to show how many characters are waiting in the buffer.

Next, you clear the screen, and PRINT the statements that you wish to
have executed on the screen, carefully positioning them so that the
first statement to be entered is on the fourth line of the screen.

You then home the cursor and execute an END statement.  This causes
the keyboard buffer to be read, and the carriage returns to be
executed, thus entering the printed lines as if they had been typed in
immediate or direct mode.  The program can be continued by including a
GOTO statement in the last line entered.

Many interesting effects can be achieved using this method.  Examples
of a few of these are included below.  For example, program lines can
be added, modified, or deleted, while the program is running.  The
following example shows how this is done:

10 REM THIS LINE WILL BE DELETED
20 REM A NEW LINE 30 WILL BE CREATED
40 PRINT CHR$(147):PRINT:PRINT
50 PRINT "80 LIST":PRINT"30 REM THIS LINE WASN'T HERE BEFORE"
60 PRINT "10":PRINT "GOTO 80"CHR$(19)
70 FOR I=631 TO 634:POKE I,13:NEXT:POKE 198,4:END
80 REM THIS LINE WILL BE REPLACED

You can use this technique to enter numbered DATA statements
automatically, using values in memory.  These statements become a
permanent part of the program.

Another interesting application is taking ASCII program lines from a
tape data file, or sequential disk file, and having them entered
automatically.  This can be used for merging programs, or for
transferring programs between computers with a modem and a terminal
program.  To create the ASCII program file, you use CMD to direct a
LISTing to the desired device as follows:

For tape: OPEN 1,1,1,"ASCII":CMD 1:LIST
After the listing has ended: PRINT #1:CLOSE 1

For disk: OPEN 8,8,8,"ASCII,S,W":CMD 8:LIST
After the listing has ended: PRINT #8:CLOSE 8

This file can then be uploaded using a modem and appropriate terminal
software, entered by itself or merged with another program by using
the following program.  Be sure to save this program before you run
it, because it will erase itself when it is done.

60000 OPEN 1,8,8,"ASCII"
60010 POKE 152,1:B=0:GOSUB 60170
60020 GET #1,A$:IF A$=""THEN60020
60030 IF ST AND 64 THEN 60120
60040 IF A$=CHR$(13)AND B=0THEN60020
60050 PRINT A$;:B=1:IF A$=CHR$(34)THEN POKE 212,0
60060 IF A$<>CHR$(13) THEN 60020
60070 PRINT CHR$(5);"GOTO 60010";CHR$(5):PRINT:PRINT:POKE 198,0
60080 PRINT "RETURN=KEEP LINE    S=SKIP LINE":B=0
60090 GET A$:IF A$=""THEN 60090
60100 IF A$="S" THEN 60010
60110 GOTO 60180
60120 PRINT "END OF FILE--HIT RETURN TO FINISH MERGE"
60130 IF PEEK(197)<>1THEN60130
60140 A=60000
60150 GOSUB 60170:FOR I=A TO A+60 STEP10:PRINTI:NEXT
60160 PRINT "A="I":GOTO 60150":GOTO 60180
60170 PRINT CHR$(147):PRINT:PRINT:RETURN
60180 FOR I=631TO640:POKEI,13:NEXT:POKE198,10:PRINTCHR$(19);:END

If you wish to merge additional programs at the same time, when it
indicates that the file has ended, press the STOP key rather than
RETURN, enter the name of the new file in line 60000, and RUN 60000
