# - C64 RAM Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $0298 BITNUM: number of zero bits to add to a data character to pad it to the word length set by the RS-232 control register (referenced at $0293).

$0298        BITNUM  RS-232: Number of Bits Left to be Sent/Received
                     
                     This location is used to determine how many zero bits must be added to
                     the data character to pad its length out to the word length specified
                     in 659 ($0293).
