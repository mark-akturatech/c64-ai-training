# Contents - Use of Commodore 64 collision registers to detect sprite-to-sprite and sprite-to-background collisions (e.g., PAC-MAN hitting ghosts or pellets). Notes on potential difficulty in tracking which pellets have been eaten and the screen orientation difference (arcade monitors rotated 90 degrees) affecting layout.

Since the Commodore 64 maintains collision 
registers to determine collisions between sprites and 
between sprites and background, determining when 
PAC-MAN hits a ghost or power pellet should be 
no problem. The only part of the program that may 
be difficult is the part where it is determined which 
of the normal pellets PAC-MAN has eaten. For the 
most part, putting PAC-MAN on the Commodore 
64 would be a very direct translation. On the arcade 
game, the video monitor is rotated 90 degrees, 
which makes the maze taller than it is wide. This 
would be the only major discrepency between the 
arcade machine and a Commodore 64 translation.
