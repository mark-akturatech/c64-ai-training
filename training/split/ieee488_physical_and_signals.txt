# Commodore IEC Serial Bus Protocol Reference - pagetable.com - Physical connector and signal summary of IEEE-488 (PET/CBM): 24-pin connectors, DIO data lines (8), handshake lines NRFD/DAV/NDAC, control lines EOI/ATN/SRQ/REN/IFC. Also notes PET-specific defaults (REN grounded, SRQ unused).

================================================================================
PART 1: IEEE-488 (PET/CBM ORIGINAL PARALLEL BUS)
================================================================================

The PET uses a proprietary 24-pin edge connector, while standard IEEE-488
devices employ 24-pin micro ribbon connectors. These connectors feature male
and female sides on cables, enabling daisy-chaining.

Signal Lines and Protocol:

  Data and Control Lines:
    - Eight DIO (Data I/O) lines carry data bytes in parallel
    - Three handshake lines:
        NRFD (Not Ready For Data)
        DAV  (Data Valid)
        NDAC (No Data Accepted)
    - Control lines:
        EOI (End Or Identify)
        ATN (Attention)
        SRQ (Service Request)
        REN (Remote Enable)
        IFC (Interface Clear)
