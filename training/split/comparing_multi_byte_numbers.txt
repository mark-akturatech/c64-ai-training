# MACHINE - Comparing multi-byte unsigned numbers: subtract one number from the other (need not keep result) and inspect carry. If C set after subtraction, the minuend >= subtrahend; if C clear, minuend < subtrahend. CMP/CPX/CPY useful for single-byte compares.



Comparing Numbers
-----------------

If we have two unsigned numbers and wish to know which one is larger, we can
use the appropriate compare instruction--CMP, CPX, or CPY--and then check the
carry flag.  We've done this before.  If the numbers are more than one byte
long, however, it's not quite so easy.  We must then use a new technique.

The easiest way to go about such a comparison is to subtract one number from
the other.  You need not keep the result; all you care about is the carry
flag when the subtraction is complete.  If the C flag is set, the first
number (the one you are subtracting from) is greater than or equal to the
second number.  Why?  Because carry set indicated that the unsigned
subtraction was legal; we have subtracted the two numbers and have obtained a
positive (unsigned) result.  On the other hand, if the C flag ends up clear,
this would mean that the first number is less than the second.  The
subtraction couldn't take place correctly since the result--a negative
number--can't be represented in unsigned arithmetic.
