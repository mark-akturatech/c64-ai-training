# COMMODORE 64 - RUN [<line-number>]: starts program in memory. In direct mode, RUN implies CLR (clears variables) unless using CONT or GOTO. If line-number specified starts at that line. RUN within a program resumes and may produce UNDEF'D STATEMENT if specified line doesn't exist. Program stops on END, STOP, last line executed, or BASIC error. Examples.

  RUN

  TYPE: Command
  FORMAT: RUN [<line-number>]

    Action: The system command RUN is used to start the program currently
  in memory. The RUN command causes an implied CLR operation to be
  performed before starting the program. You can avoid the CLeaRing
  operation by using CONT or GOTO to restart a program instead of RUN. If
  a <line-number> is specified, your program will start on that line.
  Otherwise, the RUN command starts at first line of the program. The RUN
  command can also be used within a program. If the <line-number> you
  specify doesn't exist, the BASIC error message UNDEF'D STATEMENT occurs.
    A RUNning program stops and BASIC returns to direct mode when an END or
  STOP statement is reached, when the last line of the program is finished,
  or when a BASIC error occurs during execution.

  EXAMPLES of RUN Command:

    RUN           (Starts at first line of program)

    RUN 500       (Starts at line-number 500)
    RUN X         (Starts at line X, or UNDEF'D STATEMENT ERROR
                   if there is no line X)
