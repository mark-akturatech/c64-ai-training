# COMMODORE 64 - Worked example: a small machine-language program that prints the alphabet using KERNAL print routine. Introduces TXA (transfer X to A) and shows program listing (LDX #$41; TXA; JSR $FFD2; INX; CPX #$5B; BNE $1402; BRK) and how to run it (.G 1400). Advice to write and test programs in small parts and comment code.

    This program. will display the alphabet using a KERNAL routine. The
  only new instruction introduced here is TXA Transfer the contents of the
  X index register, into the Accumulator.

    .A 1400 LDX #$41     - X = CBM ASCII of "A"
    .A 1402 TXA          - A = X
    .A 1403 JSR $FFD2    - print character
    .A 1406 INX          - bump count
    .A 1407 CPX #$5B     - have we gone past "Z"?
    .A 1409 BNE $1402    - no, go back and do more
    .A 140B BRK          - yes, return to 64MON

    To see the Commodore 64 print the alphabet, type the familiar command:


    .G 1400


    The comments that are beside the program, explain the program flow and
  logic. If you are writing a program, write it on paper first, and then
  test it in small parts if possible.
