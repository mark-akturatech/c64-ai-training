# Contents - Illustrations and discussion of how filter cutoff frequency changes affect frequency amplitude for low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass filters (figures referenced). Visual explanation of filter effects on spectrum as cutoff is varied.

ways. 

Low pass filter. When the low pass filter is 
selected, all frequencies above the cutoff frequen- 
cy are attenuated at the rate of 12 dB/Octave. This 
filtering mode will generate a full sound. 

Band pass filter. The bandpass filter will at- 
tenuate all of the frequencies above and below the 
cutoff frequency at the rate of 6 dB/Octave. A band- 
pass filter produces thin sounds. 

High pass filter. All of the frequencies below 
the cutoff frequency will be attenuated at the rate 
of 12 dB/Octave when the highpass filter is selected. 
Tinny sounds can be generated when using this 
mode. Figures 8-5 through 8-7 show graphics fre-
