# ********* - Chapter 8 intro and Section 8.1: Overview of programming the disk controller (adding routines to disk controller memory), and BLOCK-EXECUTE command (PRINT#file#, "B-E:" channel; drive; track; block) which loads a block into the buffer and executes it starting at buffer address until RTS.




8. PROGRAMMING THE DISK CONTROLLER

The expert programmer can actually design routines that reside and
operate on the disk controller.  DOS routines can be added that come
from the diskette.  Routines can be added much the same way as the DOS
Support Program is "wedged" into your memory.

8.1 BLOCK-EXECUTE

This command will load a block from the diskette containing a machine
language routine, and begin executing it at location 0 in the buffer
until a RTS (ReTurn from Subroutine) command is encountered.

FORMAT FOR BLOCK-EXECUTE:

    PRINT#file#, "B-E:" channel; drive; track; block
