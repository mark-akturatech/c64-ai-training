# ********* - FACOV ($70): holds the low-order mantissa byte for FAC1 used when the true mantissa has more significant figures than fit in four bytes. These extra least-significant figures extend intermediate accuracy and are used for final rounding.


112           $70            FACOV
Low Order Mantissa Byte of Floating Point Accumulator #1 (For
Rounding)

If the mantissa of the floating point number has more significant
figures than can be held in four bytes, the least significant figures
are placed here.  They are used to extend the accuracy of intermediate
mathematical operations and to round to the final figure.
