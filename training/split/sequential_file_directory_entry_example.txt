# byRiclianll - Explains that 1541TEST/DEMO contains no sequential files, but the C-64 DISK BONUS PACK contains a sequential file named "DIRECTORY". Shows the directory listing location (track 18, sector 01) and presents the directory entry bytes (hex and ASCII) for the file as displayed in the directory. Notes that sequential files are marked with $81, that the first data block for "DIRECTORY" is stored on track 17 ($11) sector 1 ($01), and that the file length is two blocks. Prepares to show the starting data block contents.
