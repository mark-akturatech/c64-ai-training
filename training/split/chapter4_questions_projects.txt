# MACHINE - Questions and projects: write subtraction and conditional arithmetic programs; use LSR to test odd/even; practice input/output and arithmetic in ML routines.

                                                                         :69:

- If we wish to multiply by a value other than two, we may need to do more
  work but we can get there.

- As we might have expected, we may write subroutines in machine language and
  then call them from machine language.  It's a good way to organize your
  code.


Questions and Projects
----------------------

Write a program to subtract two single-digit numbers, similar to the one in
the above exercise.  You may continue to use the subroutine from the previous
chapter.

Write a program to input a single-digit number.  If the number is less than
five, double it and print the result.  If the number is five or over, divide
it by two (discarding any remainder) and print the result.  Try to produce a
neat output.

Write a program to input a single-digit number.  Print the word ODD or EVEN
behind the number, depending on whether it is odd or even.  Use the LSR
instruction followed by a BCC or BCS test to check for odd or even.

If you've been following the logic, you have developed quite a bit of
capability in machine language.  You can input, you can output, and you can
do quite a bit of arithmetic in between.
