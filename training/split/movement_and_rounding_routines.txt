# ********* - MOVFM (move five-byte FP from memory into FAC1), MOV2F (move FAC1 to memory), MOVFA (move FAC2 to FAC1), MOVAF (round and move FAC1 to FAC2), MOVEF (copy FAC1 to FAC2 without rounding), and ROUND (adjust rounding byte — may increment FAC1). Covers routines that move floating point values between memory and the two accumulators and rounding behavior.

48034         $BBA2          MOVFM
Move a Floating Point Number from Memory to FAC1

This routine loads FAC1 with the five-byte floating point number
pointed to by the address stored in the Accumulator (low byte) and the
.Y register (high byte).

48071         $BBC7          MOV2F
Move a Floating Point Number from FAC1 to Memory

This routine is used to move a number from the Floating Point
Accumulator (FAC1) to memory at either 92-96 ($5C-$60) or 87-91
($57-$5B), depending on the entry point to the routine.

48124         $BBFC          MOVFA
Move a Floating Point Number from FAC2 to FAC1

48140         $BC0C          MOVAF
Round and Move a Floating Point Number from FAC1 to FAC2

48143         $BC0F          MOVEF
Copy FAC1 to FAC2 Without Rounding

48155         $BC1B          ROUND
Round Accumulator #1 by Adjusting the Rounding Byte

If doubling the rounding byte at location 112 ($70) makes it greater
than 128, the value of FAC1 is increased by 1.
