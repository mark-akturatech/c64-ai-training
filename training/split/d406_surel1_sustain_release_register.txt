# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $D406 (54278) SUREL1 — Voice 1 Sustain/Release Register: bits4-7 select sustain level (0..15) representing volume held after decay; bits0-3 select release duration (0..15) with same timing table as decay. Explains usage and examples of values/time mapping.

$D406        SUREL1       Voice 1 Sustain/Release Control Register

                     0-3  Select release cycle duration (0-15)
                     4-7  Select sustain volume level (0-15)

                          Bits 4-7 select the volume level at which the note is sustained.
                          Following the decay cycle, the volume of the output of voice 1 will
                          remain at the selected sustain level as long as the gate bit of the
                          Control Register is set to 1.  The sustain values range from 0, which
                          chooses no volume, to 15, which sets the output of voice 1 equal to
                          the peak volume achieved during the attack cycle.

                          Bits 0-3 determine the length of the release cycle.  This phase, in
                          which the volume fades from the sustain level to near zero volume,
                          begins when the gate bit of the Control Register is set to 0 (while
                          leaving the waveform setting that was previously chosen).  The
                          duration of this decline in volume corresponds to the number (0-15)
                          selected in the same way as for the decay value:
