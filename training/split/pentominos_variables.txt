# MACHINE - PENTOMINOS program variables and utility note: includes an optional UTILITIES note (WFDis disassembler), and variables such as $033C (piece number), $033D-$033E (board size W1/W2), $033F (P1 pieces placed), $0340-$034B log U(..), $034C-$0357 T(..) piece rotations, $0358-$035C X(..) locations, $035D-$0361 Y(..), $0362-$0370 tables to place pieces, $037F-$039C board edge table, $039D-$03D8 B(..) board.

                                                                        :314:

This program makes use of tables, and is worth studying for that reason.  It
is also useful to examine the close relationship between the BASIC program
and its machine language equivalent, especially starting at line 2000 in
BASIC.

As with FACTORS, the machine language program is relocated by BASIC so that
it starts at hexadecimal 156D (with tables starting at $12FA) regardless of
where it was originally loaded.  Again, this is necessary for the VIC-20 and
proves to be convenient for study purposes on all machines--except the B-128
version, where this relocation does not happen.

Students wishing to disassemble PENTOMINOS will find the following
