# ********* - Describes RIPRTY ($AB), used to detect RS-232 transmission errors (parity) and to count tape leader length (used to detect end of leader).

171           $AB            RIPRTY
RS-232 Input Parity/Cassete Leader Counter

This location is used to help detect if data was lost during RS-232
transmission, or if a tape leader is completed.
