# 6502 Instruction Set - Rockwell R6500 family (R6500/11/12/15) additions: bit-manipulation instructions (BBR/BBS/RMB/SMB) similar to WDC; additional interrupts, registers, and I/O control registers accessed via reserved addresses (not impacting base instruction set). Lists Rockwell-specific BBR/BBS/RMB/SMB opcode tables (same format as W65C02), with notes on operand types and cycle counts.

                 SMB  Set Memory Bit ***
                      Similar to RMB, but sets the respective bit.
                      This is an entire family of eight instructions
                      in total, setting one of bits #0to #7, each.
                      Individual mnemonics designate the bit to be
                      set, as in SMBn, where n = 0..7.
                      The operand is always a zeropage address.

                 STP  Stop Mode
                      Stops and sets the signal on pin PHI2 to high.
                      A reset signal will "wake up" the processor quickly.

                 TRB  Test and Reset Memory Bit***
                      This instruction first ANDs the contents of the given
                      memory location with the contents of the accumulator (A)
                      and sets the Z flag accordingly to the result, much
                      like the BIT instruction. Then, the contents of the
                      memory location is ANDed with the compliment of the
                      mask in A, and then written back, thus clearing the
                      bit(s) set in A.
                      In other words, TRB clears the bits set in A in the
                      specified location and sets Z, if any of these bits
                      were set, otherwise resetting Z.
                                                                   6502 Instruction Set
