# byRiclianll - Interpretation and commentary for the preceding dumps: explains that bytes 0 and 1 are the track/sector link to the next block (here pointing to track $10 sector $0B), bytes 2 and 3 are the load address (here $0401), notes about this file being written on a PET, differences in BASIC start addresses on various machines, instructions to LOAD with relocation (LOAD "DIR",8), and a note about VERIFY failing because internal BASIC links changed when relocated. Includes the raw two-byte forward-link line that begins the forward chain.

Not  very  recognizable  is  it?  Remember  this  is  C64  internal  BASIC  not  a  BASIC  listing. 
Bytes  0  and  1  are  of  interest.  They  are  the  track  and  sector  link  that  point  to  the  next 
block  in  the  program  file.  In  this  case,  they  point  to  track  16  ($10),  sector  11  ($0B).  Since 
this  is  the  first  data  block  of  the  file,  bytes  2  and  3  are  also  important.  They  are  the 
load  address.  We  can  see  that  the  load  address  is  $0401  or  1025  decimal.  This  file  was 
written  on  a  PET.  (The  start  of  BASIC  memory  on  the  C64  is  at  $0801.  The  VIC-20 
begins  at  $1001,  $1201,  or  $0401  depending  ont  he  amount  of  external  memory.)  DIR 
will  require  a  straight  relocating  load,  i.e.,  LOAD  "DIR",8.  If  you  used  a  LOAD  "DIR", 
8,1  command,  the  program  would  be  loaded  into  the  screen  RAM  of  the  C64.  NOTE:  If 
you  load  this  program  properly,  you  will  NOT  be  able  to  get  it  to  VERIFY  correctly. 
The  reason  is  that  the  internal  BASIC  links  were  changed  when  the  program  was 
relocated.
