# ********* - CIA #2 Data Direction Registers (56578-56579 $DD02-$DD03) Bit mappings (0=input,1=output). Timer registers TI2ALO/TI2AHI/TI2BLO/TI2BHI at 56580-56583 $DD04-$DD07 mirror CIA#1 timer functionality; CIA#2 TOD registers at 56584-56587 $DD08-$DD0B (BCD format) behave like CIA#1 but OS doesn't use them. CI2SDR (56588 $DD0C) serial data port exists but OS does not use it. CI2ICR (56589 $DD0D) Interrupt Control Register mirrors CIA#1 functionality; FLAG line on CIA#2 is accessible via User Port and can cause interrupts for handshaking.

Location Range: 56580-56583 ($DD04-$DD07)
Timer A and B Low and High Bytes

These four timer registers are used to control Timers A and B.  For
details on the operation of these timers, see the entry for Location
Range 56324-56327 ($DC04-$DC07).

The 64 Operating System uses the CIA #2 Timers A and B mostly for
timing RS-232 send and receive operations.  Serial Bus timing uses CIA
#1 Timer B.

56580         $DD04          TI2ALO
Timer A (low byte)

56581         $DD05          TI2AHI
Timer A (high byte)

56582         $DD06          TI2BLO
Timer B (low byte)

56583         $DD07          TI2BHI
Timer B (high byte)

Location Range: 56584-56587 ($DD08-$DD0B)
Time of Day Clock

In addition to the two general purpose timers, the 6526 CIA chip has a
special purpose Time of Day Clock, which keeps time in a format that
humans can understand a little more easily than microseconds.  For
more information about this clock, see the entry for Location Range
56328-56331 ($DC08-$DC0B).  The 64's Operating system does not make
use of these registers.

56584         $DD08          TO2TEN
Time of Day Clock Tenths of Seconds

Bits 0-3:  Time of Day tenths of second digit (BCD)
Bits 4-7:  Unused

56585         $DD09          TO2SEC
Time of Day Clock Seconds

Bits 0-3:  Second digit of Time of Day seconds (BCD)
Bits 4-6:  First digit of Time of Day seconds (BCD)
Bit 7:  Unused

56586         $DD0A          TO2MIN
Time of Day Clock Minutes

Bits 0-3:  Second digit of Time of Day minutes (BCD)
Bits 4-6:  First digit of Time of Day minutes (BCD)
Bit 7:  Unused

56587         $DD0B          TO2HRS
Time of Day Clock Hours

Bits 0-3:  Second digit of Time of Day hours (BCD)
Bit 4:  First digit of Time of Day hours (BCD)
Bits 5-6:  Unused
Bit 7:  AM/PM flag (1=PM, 0=AM)

56588         $DD0C          CI2SDR
Serial Data Port

The CIA chip has an on-chip serial port, which allows you to send or
receive a byte of data one bit at a time, with the most significant
bit (Bit 7) being transferred first.  For more information about its
use, see the entry for location 56332 ($DC0C).  The 64's Operating
System does not use this facility.

56589         $DD0D          CI2ICR
Interrupt Control Register

Bit 0:  Read / did Timer A count down to 0?  (1=yes)
        Write/ enable or disable Timer A interrupt (1=enable, 0=disable)
Bit 1:  Read / did Timer B count down to 0?  (1=yes)
        Write/ enable or disable Timer B interrupt (1=enable, 0=disable)
Bit 2:  Read / did Time of Day Clock reach the alarm time?  (1=yes)
        Write/ enable or disable TOD clock alarm interrupt (1=enable,
        0=disable)
Bit 3:  Read / did the serial shift register finish a byte?  (1=yes)
        Write/ enable or disable serial shift register interrupt (1=enable,
        0=disable)
Bit 4:  Read / was a signal sent on the FLAG line?  (1=yes)
        Write/ enable or disable FLAG line interrupt (1=enable, 0=disable)
Bit 5:  Not used
Bit 6:  Not used
Bit 7:  Read / did any CIA #2 source cause an interrupt?  (1=yes)
        Write/ set or clear bits of this register (1=bits written with 1 will
        be set, 0=bits written with 1 will be cleared)
