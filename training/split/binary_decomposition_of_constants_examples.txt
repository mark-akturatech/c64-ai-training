# 6502 Multiplication and Division Algorithms - Source: llx.com - Explains how to determine which powers of two to combine by inspecting the binary representation of the constant. Provides examples: 3 = 11b (1x + 2x), 10 = 1010b (2x + 8x), and 25 = 11001b (1x + 8x + 16x). Includes annotated binary diagrams showing the contributions of each '1' bit.


So how do we figure out what powers of two we need to add to get the
answer?  Easy:  Just write the binary equivalent of the constant, and
look for the 1 bits.  The position of each 1 bit shows which powers of
two need to be added to get the answer.  For example,


3 (decimal) = 11 (binary)
              |+--  1
              +--- +2
                   --
                    3, i.e. 1x + 2x = 3x

10 (decimal) = 1010 (binary)
               | +--  2
               +---- +8
                     --
                     10, i.e. 2x + 8x = 10x

25 (decimal) = 11001 (binary)
               ||  +--   1
               |+-----   8
               +------ +16
                       ---
                        25, i.e. x + 8x + 16x = 25x.
