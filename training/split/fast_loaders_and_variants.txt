# Commodore IEC Serial Bus Protocol Reference - pagetable.com - Notes on fast loaders and protocol variants: JiffyDOS (1985) modifies both the computer KERNAL and drive DOS ROM for higher throughput by changing byte protocol; Fast Serial (C128, 1986) uses CIA hardware serial register requiring compatible drives; many software fast loaders upload custom drive code to improve speed. Explains fundamental IEC limitation: CPU must bit-bang bits and C64 VIC-II DMA steals cycles.

NOTES ON FAST LOADERS AND PROTOCOL VARIANTS
================================================================================

The slow speed of the standard IEC serial bus on the C64 (under 1 KB/sec)
led to numerous fast loader implementations:

  JiffyDOS (1985):
    Software modification for both C64 and drive. Replaces the serial bus
    routines in both the computer's KERNAL and the drive's DOS ROM. Achieves
    significantly higher throughput by using a different byte transfer protocol.

  Fast Serial (C128, 1986):
    Hardware enhancement using the CIA chip's serial port register for
    hardware-assisted byte transfer. Requires compatible drives (1571, 1581).
    Available only on the C128.

  Software Fast Loaders:
    Many commercial and public domain fast loaders exist that replace the
    serial bus timing with custom protocols, often achieving 5-10x speed
    improvements. These typically work by uploading custom code to the drive's
    RAM and using modified transfer protocols.

The fundamental limitation of the IEC bus is that it requires the CPU to
bit-bang each bit of every byte, and on the C64, the VIC-II chip regularly
steals CPU cycles for DMA, making precise timing difficult.
