# COMMODORE 64 - Examples of arithmetic operator usage: addition examples (2+2, A+B+C), subtraction (4-1, 4-(-2)), unary minus examples (-5, -9E4), multiplication examples (100*2, A*X1), division examples (10/2, A/B), and exponentiation examples (2^2, 3^-2, AB^CD).

    EXAMPLES:
                     2+2
                     A+B+C
                     X%+1
                     BR+10E-2

    SUBTRACTION (-): The minus sign (-) specifies that the operand on the
  right is subtracted from the operand on the left.

    EXAMPLES:
                     4-1
                     100-64
                     A-B
                     55-142

    The minus can also be used as a unary minus. That means that it is the
  minus sign in front of a negative number. This is equal to subtracting
  the number from zero (0).

    EXAMPLES:
                     -5
                     -9E4
                     -B
                     4-(-2) same as 4+2

    MULTIPLICATION (*): An asterisk (*) specifies that the operand on the
  left is multiplied by the operand on the right.

    EXAMPLES:
                     100*2
                     50*0
                     A*X1
                     R%*14

    DIVISION (/): The slash (/) specifies that the operand on the left is
  divided by the operand on the right.

    EXAMPLES:
                     10/2
                     6400/4
                     A/B
                     4E2/XR

    EXPONENTIATION     The up arrow (^) specifies that the operand on the
  left is raised to the power specified by the operand on the right (the
  exponent). If the operand on the right is a 2, the number on the left is
  squared; if the exponent is a 3, the number on the left is cubed, etc.
  The exponent can be any number so long as the result of the operation
  gives a valid floating-point number.

    EXAMPLES:
                     2^2        Equivalent to: 2*2
                     3^3        Equivalent to: 3*3*3
                     4^4        Equivalent to: 4*4*4*4
                     AB^CD
                     3^-2       Equivalent to: 1/3*1/3
