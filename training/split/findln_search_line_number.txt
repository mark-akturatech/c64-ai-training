Search for Line Number

This routine searches through the program text, trying to match the
two-byte integer line number that is stored in 20-21 ($14-$15).  If it
is found, 95-96 ($5F-$60) will be set as a pointer to the address of
the link field for that line, and the Carry flag will be set.  If it
is not found, the Carry flag will be cleared.
