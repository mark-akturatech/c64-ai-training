# COMMODORE 64 - CLOSE: close a single logical file when I/O operations on it are complete. Contains purpose, call address ($FFC3 / 65475), communication register (A—file number), preparatory notes, possible error returns (0,240 via READST), stack/register remarks, usage steps (load A with logical file number, JSR CLOSE) and example (LDA #15; JSR CLOSE).

  B-9. Function Name: CLOSE

    Purpose: Close a logical file
    Call address: $FFC3 (hex) 65475 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns: 0,240 (See READST)
    Stack requirements: 2+
    Registers affected: A, X, Y

    Description: This routine is used to close a logical file after all I/O
  operations have been completed on that file. This routine is called after
  the accumulator is loaded with the logical file number to be closed (the
  same number used when the file was opened using the OPEN routine).
