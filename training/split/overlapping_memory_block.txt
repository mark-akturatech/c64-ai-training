# Kick Assembler - Explains detection of overlaps when assembling segments. By default overlaps give errors; can allow with 'allowOverlap' parameter (useful for patching). Example shows .file [name="patched.prg", segments="Base,Patch", allowOverlap] with .segmentdef Base [prgFiles="data/base.prg"] and .segment Patch [] using *= to insert jumps/ldas. Explains how overlapping blocks are resolved by priority (latest added wins).

BasicUpstart

_start

Adds a memory block with a basic upstart program that points to the
given start address.

10.14. Intermediate segments
When segments are used in other directives than the .segment and .segmentdef directive its often done using
an intermediate segment. Memory blocks are passed on through an implicit created segment which gives you a lot
of the functionality explained in this chapter simply by using the same parameters.
E.g. This means that you can use the file directive like this:
.file [name="myfile.prg", segments="Code,Data", sidFiles="music.sid"]

The only parameter that is special for the file directive is 'name'. The rest is standard parameters for directives
using intermediate segments. For a complete list of intermediate parameters see the 'List of segment parameters'
section placed last in this chapter.

10.15. The .segmentout directive
The .segmentout directive places the bytes of an intermediate segment in the current memory block. This can be
used for reallocating code or data like with the .pseudopc directive. It is also good for outputting data in alternative
formats as shown in the 'quick examples' section.
Here is an example that execute some code in the zeropage:

start:
loop:
