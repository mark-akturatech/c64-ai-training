# Contents - Implied addressing: single-byte instructions where the CPU infers the operand register (e.g., TAX transfers A to X). These execute faster because no address calculation or memory fetch is required.

Implied Addressing 

Instructions that use implied addressing are on- 
ly one byte long. Instead of having to give an ad- 
dress in the instruction, the microprocessor decides 
on which one of its internal registers to use based 
on the instruction. For instance, the TAX instruc- 
tion will transfer the contents of the accumulator 



to the X register. This is known to the 

microprocessor without the need for any other ad- 
dresses. Because the microprocessor doesn't need 
to calculate or load an address when using implied 
addressing, these instructions execute faster than 
any other type of instruction.
