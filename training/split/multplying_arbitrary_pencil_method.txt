# 6502 Multiplication and Division Algorithms - Source: llx.com - High-level description of schoolbook multiplication (decimal example) converted to algorithm: initialize answer to 0, for each digit of multiplier remove rightmost digit, multiply multiplicand by that digit, add shifted result to the answer. Leads into binary version of the same idea.

Multplying Arbitrary Numbers
----------------------------------------


A reasonable way to multiply arbitrary numbers is to do it the way
you learned in school, with pencil and paper.  Consider an example:


654
 x 321
 -----
654
 1308
1962
------
209934


If the steps are written out as an algorithm, it goes something like
this:


  * Set the answer to 0.

  * Repeat as many times as there are digits in the bottom number:


  * Remove the rightmost digit of the bottom number.

  * Multiply the top number by the digit just removed.

  * Add the result to the answer, shifted one more place to the left
      each time.
