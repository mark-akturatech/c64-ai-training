# byRiclianll - Covers FDC error-code semantics and job ordering: an FDC error code of 1 (or 00/OK) indicates successful completion; any other nonzero value indicates an error. Notes the hierarchy used in the program listing: SEEK (find track) must precede READ of a sector. Also states that initialization (drive init) is not strictly necessary when working the job queue directly, though the example includes it as habit; direct access can be used for damaged or DOS-protected disks.


Error  handling  is  a  bit  out  of  the  ordinary  too  but  not  all  that  hard  to  comprehend  either. 
An  FDC  error  code  of  1  means  the  job  was  completed  successfully.  Any  other  number 
indicates  an  error. 

You  will  also  note  a  simple  hierarchy  of  jobs  in  the  program  hsting.  Before  we  can  read 
a  sector  Oine  220)  we  must  always  find  the  track  first  Oine  180).  Now  are  you  ready 
for  this  one?  Initialization  is  not  necessary  at  all  when  working  the  job  queue  directly. 
Lines  120-140  were  included  as  a  force  of  habit.  Applications  like  reading  damaged  or 
DOS  protected  diskettes  may  dictate  that  we  do  not  initialize.  Now  for  the  bad  news.
