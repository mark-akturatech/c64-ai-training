# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - General note: Voice 2 and Voice 3 registers correspond almost exactly to Voice 1 registers; difference: sync/ring-mod bits connect different oscillators (voice2 sync/ring uses oscillators 1 & 2; voice3 uses 2 & 3).

$D407-$D414               Voice 2 and Voice 3 Controls

                          The various control registers for these two voices correspond almost
                          exactly to those of voice 1.  The one exception is that the sync and
                          ring-modulation bits of voice 2 operate on Oscillators 1 and 2, while
                          the same bits of the Control Register for voice 3 uses Oscillators 2
                          and 3.
