# COMMODORE 64 - Introduces multi-color character mode: trades horizontal resolution for 4 color choices per dot (background #0, bg #1, bg #2, or character color). To enable multi-color character mode set bit 4 of VIC-II control register at 53270 ($D016) (POKE 53270,PEEK(53270)OR 16); to disable clear bit 4 (POKE 53270,PEEK(53270)AND239). Color memory bit 3 controls whether each character cell is multi-color (>=8) or high-resolution (<8).

  MULTI-COLOR MODE GRAPHICS

    Standard high-resolution graphics give you control of very small dots
  on the screen. Each dot in character memory can have 2 possible values,
  1 for on and 0 for off. When a dot is off, the color of the screen is
  used in the space reserved for that dot. If the dot is on, the dot is
  colored with the character color you have chosen for that screen posi-
  tion. When you're using standard high-resolution graphics, all the dots
  within each 8X8 character can either have background color or foreground
  color. In some ways this limits the color resolution within that space.
  For example, problems may occur when two different colored lines cross.
    Multi-color mode gives you a solution to this problem. Each dot in
  multi-color mode can be one of 4 colors: screen color (background color
  register #0), the color in background register #1, the color in back-
  ground color register #2, or character color. The only sacrifice is in
  the horizontal resolution, because each multi-color mode dot is twice as
  wide as a high-resolution dot. This minimal loss of resolution is more
  than compensated for by the extra abilities of multi-color mode.

  MULTI-COLOR MODE BIT

    To turn on multi-color character mode, set bit 4 of the VIC-II control
  register at 53270 ($D016) to a 1 by using the following POKE:

    POKE 53270,PEEK(53270)OR 16

    To turn off multi-color character mode, set bit 4 of location 53270 to
  a 0 by the following POKE:

    POKE 53270,PEEK(53270)AND 239

    Multi-color mode is set on or off for each space on the screen, so that
  multi-color graphics can be mixed with high-resolution (hi-res) graphics.
  This is controlled by bit 3 in color memory. Color memory begins at
  location 55296 ($D800 in HEX). If the number in color memory is less than
  8 (0-7) the corresponding space on the video screen will be standard
  hi-res, in the color (0-7) you've chosen. If the number located in color
  memory is greater or equal to 8 (from 8 to 15), then that space will be
  displayed in multi-color mode.

    By POKEing a number into color memory, you can change the color of the
  character in that position on the screen. POKEing a number from 0 to 7
  gives the normal character colors. POKEing a number between 8 and 15 puts
  the space into multi-color mode. In other words, turning BIT 3 ON in
  color memory, sets MULTI-COLOR MODE. Turning BIT 3 OFF in color memory,
