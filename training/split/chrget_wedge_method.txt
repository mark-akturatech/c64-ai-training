# COMMODORE 64 - Method 5: Replace CHRGET routine (used by BASIC to fetch characters/tokens) to implement new BASIC commands (a 'wedge'). New CHRGET examines text for special command prefix (e.g., '@'), handles user commands, otherwise passes control to normal CHRGET. Allows adding BASIC keywords with minimal performance penalty.

    5) The CHRGET routine is used by BASIC to get each character/token.
       This makes it simple to add new BASIC commands. Naturally, each new
       command must be executed by a user written machine language
       subroutine. A common way to use this method is to specify a
       character (@ for example) which will occur before any of the new
       commands. The new CHRGET routine will search for the special
       character. If none is present, control is passed to the normal BASIC
       CHRGET routine. If the special character is present, the new command
       is interpreted and executed by your machine language program. This
       minimizes the extra execution time added by the need to search for
       additional commands. This technique is often called a wedge.
