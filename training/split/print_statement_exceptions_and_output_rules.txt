# COMMODORE 64 - Continuation of PRINT behavior: the two exceptions (numeric items followed by an added space; positive numbers prefixed by a space), behavior of blanks between strings and numbers, effect of trailing commas/semicolons (continuing on same line) vs. no trailing punctuation (carriage-return/line-feed), and behavior when output exceeds 40 columns. Also commentary on the variety and complexity of PRINT.



    1) Numeric items are followed by an added space.
    2) Positive numbers have a space preceding them.

    When you use blanks or no punctuation between string constants or
  variable names it has the same effect as a semicolon. However, blanks
  between a string and a numeric item or between two numeric items will
  stop output without printing the second item.
    If a comma or a semicolon is at the end of the output-list, the next
  PRINT statement begins printing on the same line, and spaced accord-
  ingly. If no punctuation finishes the list, a carriage-return and a line-
  feed are printed at the end of the data. The next PRINT statement will
  begin on the next line. If your output is directed to the screen and the
  data printed is longer than 40 columns, the output is continued on the
  next screen line.
    There is no statement in BASIC with more variety than the PRINT
  statement. There are so many symbols, functions, and parameters
  associated with this statement that it might almost be considered as a
  language of its own within BASIC; a language specially designed for
  writing on the screen.
