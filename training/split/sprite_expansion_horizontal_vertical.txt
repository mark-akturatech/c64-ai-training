# COMMODORE 64 - Describes sprite expansion (magnification) in X and Y. To expand horizontally set bit N in register 53277 ($D01D) with POKE 53277,PEEK(53277)OR(2^SN); to clear use AND (255-2^SN). To expand vertically set bit N in register 53271 ($D017) with POKE 53271,PEEK(53271)OR(2^SN); to clear use AND (255-2^SN). Expanded sprites double dot width/height but don't change resolution — sprite simply appears larger.

  EXPANDED SPRITES

    The VIC-II chip has the ability to expand a sprite in the vertical
  direction, the horizontal direction, or both at once. When expanded, each
  dot in the sprite is twice as wide or twice as tall. Resolution doesn't
  actually increase... the sprite just gets bigger.
    To expand a sprite in the horizontal direction, the corresponding bit
  in the VIC-II control register at location 53277 ($D01D in HEX) must be
  turned ON (set to a 1). The following POKE expands a sprite in the X
  direction:

    POKE 53277,PEEK(53277)OR(2^SN)

  where SN is the sprite number from 0 to 7.

    To unexpand a sprite in the horizontal direction, the corresponding bit
  in the VIC-II control register at location 53277 ($D01D in HEX) must be
  turned OFF (set to a 0). The following POKE "unexpands" a sprite in the
  X direction:

    POKE 53277,PEEK(53277)AND (255-2^SN)

  where SN is the sprite number from 0 to 7.
    To expand a sprite in the vertical direction, the corresponding bit in
  the VIC-II control register at location 53271 ($D017 in HEX) must be
  turned ON (set to a 1). The following POKE expands a sprite in the Y
  direction:

    POKE 53271,PEEK(53271)OR(2^SN)

  where SN is the sprite number from 0 to 7.
