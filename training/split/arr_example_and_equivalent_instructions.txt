# NMOS 6510 - Concrete example and notes for ARR: shows 'ARR #$7F' (opcode bytes ;6B 7F), lists the equivalent instruction sequence 'AND #$7F / ROR A', and warns that flags differ between ARR and the equivalent sequence. Also lists test files that exercise ARR behavior (CPU/asap/cpu_decimal.prg, Lorenz-2.15/arrb.prg).

Example:
ARR #$7F

;6B 7F

Equivalent Instructions:
AND #$7F
ROR A

; flags are different with ARR, see the
; above table

Test code: CPU/asap/cpu_decimal.prg, Lorenz-2.15/arrb.prg
