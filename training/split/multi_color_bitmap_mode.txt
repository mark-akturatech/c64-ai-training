# COMMODORE 64 - Multi-color bit map mode (BMM = 1, MCM = 1): selected by setting MCM along with BMM. Uses same memory access as standard bitmap mode but interprets dot data as 2-bit pairs mapping to colors: 00 = Background #0 (register 33), 01 = upper nybble of video matrix pointer, 10 = lower nybble of video matrix pointer, 11 = video matrix color nybble (DB11-DB8). Notes that the color nybble is used in this mode, horizontal dot size is doubled resulting in 160×200 resolution, and up to three independently selected colors plus the background can appear in each 8×8 block.

  MULTI-COLOR BIT MAP MODE (BMM = MCM = 1)

    Multi-colored bit map mode is selected by setting the MCM bit in
  register 22 ($16) to a "1" in conjunction with the BMM bit. Multi-color
  mode uses the same memory access sequences as standard bit map mode, but
  interprets the dot data as follows:

        BIT PAIR      |                   DISPLAY COLOR
  --------------------+----------------------------------------------------
           00         |  Background #0 color (register 33 ($21))
           01         |  Upper nybble of video matrix pointer
           10         |  Lower nybble of video matrix pointer
           11         |  Video matrix color nybble

  Note that the color nybble (DB11-DB8) IS used for the multi-color bit map
  mode. Again, as two bits are used to select one dot color, the horizontal

  dot size is doubled, resulting in a screen resolution of 160H*200V.
  Utilizing multi-color bit map mode, three independently selected colors
  can be displayed in each 8*8 block in addition to the background color.
