# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Advice on learning 6502 machine language: get a tutorial and a reference (Programmer's Reference Guide), learn key instructions and addressing modes, then study C-64 memory map (Mapping the C-64).

Learning Machine Language
First of all, you need to learn 6502 assembly language. I'm not going to include a tutorial on assembler programming here. I'll just give a few examples and give pointers to some other good documents.

I'd suggest you do the following to learn assembler: get a tutorial, and try to grasp the general structure of it, learn some of the more important instructions, and then get a good reference, like ``Programmer's Reference Guide''. You shouldn't read the whole book, as most of it explains how to program the C-64 in BASIC. But the summary of the opcodes is nice, so that's a good reason to keep the book.

There's a pretty nice assembler tutorial in the first couple of issues of Commodore Hacking.

When you've learned some assembler, you need to know which memory addresses to poke values into to make interesting things happen. As the C-64 uses memory mapped I/O, you perform I/O operations just by putting values into memory locations, or reading from memory locations. What you need is a memory map, that tells you which addresses are special, and which ones are just RAM. ``Mapping the C-64'' is a nice and detailed memory map.

If you think you're really smart, you shouldn't even need a tutorial on assembler, all you need is a reference document and some examples. So let's look at some really simple examples.
