# byRiclianll - Explains bytes reserved for relative files and unused fields in a standard directory entry: bytes $15-$16 point to the first set of side sectors for relative (REL) files, $17 holds the record size for relative files, and the next four bytes are unused (null) for other file types.

The  next  three  bytes  are  unused  except  for  relative  file  entries.  For  a  relative  file  bytes 
$15  (21)  and  $16  (22)  point  to  the  first  set  of  side  sectors.  Byte  $17  (23)  gives  the  record 
size  with  which  the  relative  file  was  created.  This  special  file  type  will  be  examined  in 
detail  later. 


The  next  four  bytes  are  always  unused  and  therefore  null  ($00).
