# byRiclianll - Explains how Commodore varies the data clock rate per zone to pack more sectors on outer tracks. Lists divisors and clock rates: Zone 1 divisor 13 → 307,692 bits/sec (61,538.4 bits/rotation), Zone 2 divisor 14 → 285,714 bits/sec, Zone 3 divisor 15 → 266,667 bits/sec, Zone 4 divisor 16 → 250,000 bits/sec. Recording density varies across disk; formatted disk capacity and effective usable bytes are given (total storage vs usable after overhead).

clock  rate.  This  is  accomplished  by  using  a  high  speed  clock  and  dividing  the  clock  by 
N,  where  the  value  of  N  is  determined  by  the  zone.  The  table  below  summarizes  the 
clock  rates  for  each  zone.

This  scheme  provides  a  recording  density  that  varies  from  about  4000  bits/inch  on  the 
outer  tracks  to  almost  6000  bits/inch  on  the  inner  tracks. 

If  all  of  the  possible  bits  could  be  used  for  data  alone,  we  would  be  able  to  store  a  total 
of  2,027,676  bits  or  253,459  bytes  on  a  diskette.  Unfortunately,  not  all  of  these  bytes 
can  be  used  for  data.  The  total  storage  capacity  of  a  diskette  formatted  on  the  1541  is 
174,848  bytes.  The  need  for  space  to  store  a  directory  to  keep  track  of  the  location  of 
the  files  on  a  diskette  (see  Chapter  4)  further  reduces  us  to  an  effective  storage  capacity 
of  169,984  bytes  (256  bytes  *  664  sectors).
