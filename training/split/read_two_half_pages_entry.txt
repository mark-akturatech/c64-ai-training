# byRiclianll - Top-level entry that invokes the READIT subroutine to read a file in two 256-byte halves. Sequence: call READIT to read the first half, set (POINT) to point to the second half (store into POINT and MR+3), then call READIT again to read the second half. Ends with RTS to return control to BASIC.
