# CA65 Assembler - Command Line Options in Detail

Here is a description of all the command line options:



--bin-include-dir dir
Name a directory which is searched for binary include files. The option may be used more than once to specify more than one directory to search. The current directory is always searched first before considering any additional directories. See also the section about search paths.


--color
This option controls if the assembler will use colors when printing diagnostics. The default is "auto" which will enable colors if the output goes to a terminal (not to a file).


--cpu type
Set the default for the CPU type. The option takes a parameter, which may be one of

6502 - NMOS 6502 (all legal instructions)
6502X - NMOS 6502 with all undocumented instructions
6502DTV - the emulated CPU of the C64DTV device
65SC02 - first CMOS instruction set (no bit manipulation, no wai/stp)
65C02 - CMOS with Rockwell extensions
W65C02 - full CMOS instruction set (has bit manipulation and wai/stp)
65CE02 - CMOS with CSG extensions
4510 - the CPU of the Commodore C65
45GS02 - the CPU of the Commodore MEGA65
HuC6280 - the CPU of the PC engine
M740 - a Microcontroller by Mitsubishi
65816 - the CPU of the SNES, and the SCPU
sweet16 - an interpreter for a pseudo 16 bit CPU

--create-dep name
Tells the assembler to generate a file containing the dependency list for the assembled module in makefile syntax. The output is written to a file with the given name. The output does not include files passed via debug information to the assembler.


--create-full-dep name
Tells the assembler to generate a file containing the dependency list for the assembled module in makefile syntax. The output is written to a file with the given name. The output does include files passed via debug information to the assembler.

-d, --debug
Enables debug mode, something that should not be needed for mere mortals:-)


-D
This option allows you to define symbols on the command line. Without a value, the symbol is defined with the value zero. When giving a value, you may use the '$' prefix for hexadecimal symbols. Please note that for some operating systems, '$' has a special meaning, so you may have to quote the expression.


--feature name
Enable an emulation feature. This is identical as using .FEATURE in the source with two exceptions: Feature names must be lower case, and each feature must be specified by using a separate --feature option, comma separated lists are not allowed.

See the discussion of the .FEATURE command for a list of emulation features.


-g, --debug-info
When this option (or the equivalent control command .DEBUGINFO) is used, the assembler will add a section to the object file that contains all symbols (including local ones) together with the symbol values and source file positions. The linker will put these additional symbols into the VICE label file, so even local symbols can be seen in the VICE monitor.


-h, --help
Print the short option summary shown above.


-I dir, --include-dir dir
Name a directory which is searched for include files. The option may be used more than once to specify more than one directory to search. The current directory is always searched first before considering any additional directories. See also the section about search paths.


-i, --ignore-case
This option makes the assembler case insensitive on identifiers and labels. This option will override the default, but may itself be overridden by the .CASE control command.


-l name, --listing name
Generate an assembler listing with the given name. A listing file will never be generated in case of assembly errors.


--large-alignment
Disable warnings about a large combined alignment. See the discussion of the .ALIGN directive for further information.


--list-bytes n
Set the maximum number of bytes printed in the listing for one line of input. See the .LISTBYTES directive for more information. The value zero can be used to encode an unlimited number of printed bytes.
