# NMOS 6510 - Example demonstrating a fast 'noise' generator (LFSR-like) using RRA: initial seed setup in zero page, restoring accumulator and carry, performing RRA on the seed, EOR and ROR to produce a 'noise' value in A while preserving A and carry where needed. Includes brief code fragments and comments showing preservation/restoration of A and carry.

Example: noise LFSR

If you need a fast “noise” generator, something like this could work:
LDA
STA
LDA
CLC

#$e4 ; initial seed
zp1
#$01 ; initial seed

...
; restore accu and carry
RRA zp1
EOR #$01
ROR
; “noise” value in accu
; preserve accu and carry
...
