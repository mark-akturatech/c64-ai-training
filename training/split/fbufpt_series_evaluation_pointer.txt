# ********* - FBUFPT ($71-$72): pointer to a temporary table in free RAM used for series/formula evaluation. Also used for TI$ work area, string setup pointer, and array-size evaluation workspace. Notes that despite some documentation labeling it as a tape buffer pointer, BASIC ROM disassembly shows no reference for that purpose (tape buffer pointer is at location 178 ($B2)).


113-114       $71-$72        FBUFPT
Series Evaluation Pointer

This location points to the address of a temporary table of values
built in the free RAM area for the evaluation of formulas.  It is also
used for such various purposes as a TI$ work area, string setup
pointer, and work space for the evaluation of the size of an array.

Although this is labeled a pointer to the tape buffer in the
Programmer's Reference Guide, disassembly of the BASIC ROM reveals no
reference to this location for that purpose (see 178 ($B2) for pointer
to tape buffer).
