# MACHINE - Principles of addition on the 6502: start at low-order byte, clear carry with CLC before sequences, use ADC which includes incoming carry and sets C on unsigned overflow; check V for signed overflow. Examples: single-byte addition, adding two unsigned numbers at $0380+$0381 storing to $0382; two-byte addition using low byte then high byte with ADC and CLC at start; BCS for unsigned overflow and BVS for signed overflow.

We will concentrate on single-byte arithmetic principles here, touching on
multiple-byte numbers as a generalization of the same ideas.

- "subtraction_and_multi_byte_subtraction" which expands on subtraction uses inverted borrow (SEC before SBC), analogous multi-byte rules
