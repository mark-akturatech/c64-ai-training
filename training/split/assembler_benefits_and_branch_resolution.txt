# Contents - Explains basic benefits of using an assembler: it removes the need to memorize machine opcodes and automatically computes branch distances, making development of larger programs practical and less error-prone (includes a brief aside about hand-coding).

WHAT AN ASSEMBLER CAN DO FOR YOU 

An assembler relieves you from memorizing the 
actual machine codes for each of the instructions. 
It also calculates the distance from one instruction 
to another for those times when a branch must be 
taken from the main program. This is not a par- 
ticularly big deal for a short program (under 50 
lines), but as a program grows larger and more com- 
plex, the task of repeatedly doing these calculations 
by hand becomes unreasonable. (If you are the type 
of person who finds great enjoyment in hand coding 
machine language programs, let me apologize here 
for suggesting there is a better way. The rest of us 
will let the computer do the tedious jobs).
