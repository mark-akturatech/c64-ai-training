# byRiclianll - Switching to the clone disk and beginning the write phase (BASIC lines ~640–800). Tests C and branches if no data was read, prints the prompt to insert the clone disk and calls the user‑prompt subroutine, reopens the drive (OPEN15,8,15), reinitializes RW and RAM and POKE 252,34, then begins the SEEK loop for writing: FOR T = SRW TO ERW, NS calculation, sets JOB=176 and calls GOSUB 1190 (seek), error checks, updates RAM and W (write pointer), and finally GOTO 990 to jump into the write/sector‑write routine (not included in this chunk).
