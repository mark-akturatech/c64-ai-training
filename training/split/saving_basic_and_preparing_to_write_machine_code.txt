# MACHINE - Options for development workflow: save the BASIC program to tape/disk so BASIC and ML can be refined independently; for this example, the ML will be assembled directly into memory. Prepares the user to switch to the machine language monitor.

At this point, we could save the BASIC program to tape or disk and develop
the machine language program.  This would allow us to refine each of the two
parts independently.  For the sake of brevity--and because our example is an
easy one and won't need touching up--we'll write the machine code directly
into memory.
