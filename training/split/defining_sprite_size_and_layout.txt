# COMMODORE 64 - Explains sprite definition format: sprite is 24x21 dots (504 dots) requiring 63 bytes arranged as 21 rows of 3 bytes per row. Standard (hi-res) sprites use bit=1 for foreground color and 0 transparent. Multicolor sprites trade horizontal resolution (12 columns of bit-pairs) for up to 4 colors.

  possible to write a good quality game in BASIC!
    There are 8 sprites supported directly by the VIC-II chip. They are
  numbered from 0 to 7. Each of the sprites has it own definition location,
  position registers and color register, and has its own bits for enable
  and collision detection.


  DEFINING A SPRITE

    Sprites are defined like programmable characters are defined. However,
  since the size of the sprite is larger, more bytes are needed. A sprite
  is 24 by 21 dots, or 504 dots. This works out to 63 bytes (504/8 bits)

  needed to define a sprite. The 63 bytes are arranged in 21 rows of 3
  bytes each. A sprite definition looks like this.

                          BYTE 0  BYTE 1  BYTE 2
                          BYTE 3  BYTE 4  BYTE 5
                          BYTE 6  BYTE 7  BYTE 8
                            ..      ..      ..
                            ..      ..      ..
                            ..      ..      ..
                          BYTE 60 BYTE 61 BYTE 62

    Another way to view how a sprite is created is to take a look at the
  sprite definition block on the bit level. It would look something like
  Figure 3-2.
    In a standard (HI-RES) sprite, each bit set to I is displayed in that
  sprite's foreground color. Each bit set to 0 is transparent and will
  display whatever data is behind it. This is similar to a standard
  character.
    Multi-color sprites are similar to multi-color characters. Horizontal
  resolution is traded for extra color resolution. The resolution of the
  sprite becomes 12 horizontal dots by 21 vertical dots. Each dot in the
  sprite becomes twice as wide, but the number of colors displayable in the
  sprite is increased to 4.
