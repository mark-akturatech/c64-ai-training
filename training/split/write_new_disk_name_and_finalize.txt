# byRiclianll - BASIC code that writes the edited disk name back to the buffer and issues a WRITE job to the drive, then finalizes. Covers: sending an M-W (memory-write) to transfer the 16-byte NDN* into the drive buffer; setting JOB=144 (WRITE) and calling the job-queue subroutine (GOSUB 660) to perform the WRITE; polling the drive with command '10' and reading the returned EN*,EM*,ET*,ES* status; closing the command channel; printing a DONE message; and program END/cleanup (including alternative CLOSE/END labels at lines 630/640).

530  PRINT#15, "M-W"CHR*<144)CHR*(5)CHR*<1 
6)NDN* 

540  REM  WRITE 

550  J0B=144 

560  GOSUB  660 

570  PRINT#15, "10" 

580  INPUT#15,EN*,EM*,ET*,ES* 

590  CLOSE  15 

^>00  PR  I  NT  "  t  DOWN  >  DONE  !  " 

^>10  END 

^>20  REM  CLOSE 

630  CLOSE  15 

640  END
