# A Minimal C64 Datasette Program Loader - Subroutine get_byte: waits for a byte marker by calling get_pulse and checking for a 'long' marker (using threshold_medium_long). Detects end-of-data if marker's second pulse is short. Then reads 8 data bits by calling get_pulse twice per bit (first pulse ignored for data), assembling bits with ROR and using a canary bit technique to detect completion. Uses instructions: JSR, CMP, BCS, BCS, LDA, PHA, PLA, ROR, BCS, RTS.

get_byte Routine
----------------

    get_byte:
    ; wait for byte marker
        jsr get_pulse
        cmp #$ff-threshold_medium_long
        bcs get_byte    ;not long
        jsr get_pulse
        bcs b2          ;short = end of data
    ; get 8 bits
        lda #%01111111
    b1: pha
        jsr get_pulse   ;ignore first
        jsr get_pulse
        pla
        ror             ;shift in bit
        bcs b1          ;until canary bit
    b2: rts
