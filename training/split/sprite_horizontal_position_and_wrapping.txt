# COMMODORE 64 - Explains LINE 60: how POKEV,LX sets the horizontal (X) position of sprite 0 (LX 0–255), how LX wraps from 255 back to 0 due to the LX equation, and how POKEV+16,RX sets the 'right side' carry bit for positions beyond 256 (RX = 0 or 1). Covers usage of V and V+16 sprite position registers for horizontal placement and wrap behavior.

  LINE 60:

    POKEV,LX            You POKE V by itself with a value to set the Hori-
                        zontal (X) Position of sprite 0 on the screen. (See
                        SPRITEMAKING CHART on Page 176). As shown above,
                        the value of LX, which is the horizontal position
                        of the sprite, changes from 0 to 255 and when it
                        reaches 255 it automatically resets back to zero
                        because of the LX equation set up in line 55.

    POKEV+16,RX         POKEV+16 always turns on the "right side" of the
                        screen beyond position 256, and resets the
                        horizontal positioning coordinates to zero. RX is
                        either a 0 or a 1 based on the position of the
                        sprite as determined by the RX formula in line 55.
