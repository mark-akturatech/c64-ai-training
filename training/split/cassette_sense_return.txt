# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Reads the 6510 I/O port and tests the cassette sense line: loads a mask, BITs the port $01 and branches according to the bit to determine cassette switch state. Leaves flags accordingly and returns (intended to provide cassette sense in Z/Carry for callers).

                                *** return cassette sense in Zb
.,F82E A9 10    LDA #$10        set the mask for the cassette switch
.,F830 24 01    BIT $01         test the 6510 I/O port
.,F832 D0 02    BNE $F836       branch if cassette sense high
.,F834 24 01    BIT $01         test the 6510 I/O port
