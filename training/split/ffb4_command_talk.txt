# C64 KERNAL API (Lee Davison) - $FFB4 — Command serial bus device to TALK. Load accumulator with device number 4..30; routine converts number to talk address and transmits it on the serial bus so device will send data.

$FFB4          command serial bus device to TALK
               
               To use this routine the accumulator must first be loaded with a device number
               between 4 and 30. When called this routine converts this device number to a talk
               address. Then this data is transmitted as a command on the Serial bus.
