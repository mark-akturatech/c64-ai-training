# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - Directly stores a character to screen RAM and its colour to colour RAM. Saves the character in Y, initializes the blink timer (BLNCT), synchronises the colour pointer, then writes the character from (A) to ($D1),Y and colour from X to ($F3),Y.

                                *** PRINT TO SCREEN
                                The colour pointer is synchronised, and the character in
                                (A) directly stored in the screen RAM. The character
                                colour in (X) is stored at the equivalent point in the
                                colour RAM.
