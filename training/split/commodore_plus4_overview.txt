# MACHINE - Commodore PLUS/4 overview: uses 7501 CPU (6502-compatible), BASIC expanded, screen memory and BASIC RAM moved, color/sound implemented differently, built-in machine-language monitor with assemble/disassemble features, memory arrangement more sophisticated.



Commodore PLUS/4
----------------

Similar to the Commodore 64 in many ways.  The processor is a 7501, which has
the same instruction set as the 6502.  Screen memory and BASIC RAM have been
moved a little higher.  BASIC itself is greatly expanded.

Color and sound are implemented differently to the Commodore 64.

There's a built-in machine language monitor with expanded features, such as
assemble and disassemble.  This one is convenient for machine language
programmers.

The memory arrangement is more sophisticated than on previous machines;
large implementations may require insight into the machine's detailed
architecture.
