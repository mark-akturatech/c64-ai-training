# Commodore IEC Serial Bus Protocol Reference - pagetable.com - IEC (Standard Serial) Layer 1: electrical and connector details. Female 6-pin DIN connectors, pinout (SRQ, GND, ATN, CLK, DATA, RESET), and open-collector (inverted) logic behaviour (5V = logical 0, 0V = logical 1) with implications for multi-device sharing.

PART 4: STANDARD SERIAL (IEC) BUS - LAYER 1: ELECTRICAL
================================================================================

The Standard Serial bus serializes IEEE-488's 16 parallel signal lines down
to just 5 serial lines.

Connectors & Pinout:
  Female 6-pin DIN 45322 connectors on both computers and peripherals.
  Daisy-chainable design allowing multiple devices per bus.

Signal Lines (6 pins):
  Pin 1: SRQ   (Service Request) - largely unused
  Pin 2: GND   (Ground)
  Pin 3: ATN   (Attention) - command signaling
  Pin 4: CLK   (Clock) - sender-controlled handshake
  Pin 5: DATA  (Data) - bit transmission and receiver handshake
  Pin 6: RESET - bus reset capability

Open Collector Logic:
  All signal lines use inverted open-collector logic: 5V = logical 0,
  0V = logical 1. "When all participants write 0, the line will read back 0,
  but if any device writes 1, the bus will read back as 1." This allows
  multiple devices to safely share signal lines.

  Key implications:
    - Any device can pull a line to logical 1 (0V)
    - A line reads 0 only when ALL devices release it
    - This enables collective "ready" signaling (all must release DATA)
    - A single device can hold a line regardless of other devices
