# Sprite Multiplexing Techniques by Cadaver (Lasse Oorni) - Tips for reverse-engineering sprite multiplexers: search ML monitor for byte sequences like $01 $D0 (writes to first sprite Y) or other sprite-register writes; look near IRQ address for multiplexing code. Noting pattern: an indexed memory access whose result is used only as an index (not stored to sprite I/O) is likely the sprite order array; following references to it can lead to the sortroutine.

When you look at the indexed accesses made in the sprite display interrupt code,
you'll usually notice one memory access whose result doesn't go into any sprite
I/O register, but is used as an index (either in X or Y register) for accesses
into other sprite arrays. This is likely the sprite order array, and by looking
for memory references to it you'll find the sortroutine.

Good luck in your multiplexer experiments! Remember, when you get your
multiplexer running, stress-test it with abnormal amounts of sprites...

- "raster_interrupt_optimizations_and_unrolled_code" which expands on multiplexer code is often located near IRQ handlers
