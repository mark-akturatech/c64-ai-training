# byRiclianll - Explanation and interpretation of the preceding sector dump: byte 0 = $00 indicates no forward track (end of chain); byte 1 = $86 (decimal 134) is the byte count N; byte 134 is the last valid data byte in the file. Notes that the C64 status variable (ST) will be set to 64 after byte 134 has been read. Also documents that the remainder of the block (bytes $87–$FF) is padding — here recognizable and partly taken from the C-64 DISK BONUS PACK directory — and includes the printed fragment ". 80: 4E 36 34 2E 56 31 0D xx  N64.V1." as an example.

We  can  see  from  the  above  data  block  that  this  is  the  last  sector  in  the  chain.  Byte  0 
contains  a  zero  indicating  no  forward  track.  Byte  1  then  is  a  byte  count  ($86= 134).  Byte 
134  is  the  last  byte  in  our  data  file.  Recall  that  the  status  variable  (ST)  will  be  set  to 
64  on  the  C64  side  after  byte  134  has  been  read. 

.    80:    4E  36  34  2E  56  31   OD  xx  N64.V1.

The  remainder  of  the  block  has  been  padded  ($87— $FF).  The  padding  is  clearly 
recognizable  this  time  around.  It  has  no  rhyme  or  reason  but  it  is  still  interesting  to 
say  the  least.  A  portion  of  the  C-64  DISK  BONUS  PACK  directory  itself  was  used  to 
pad  the  remainder  of  the  data  block  in  question.
