# MACHINE - Accumulator addressing: shift/rotate instructions can operate on accumulator using syntax like ASL A. INC/DEC operate directly on memory and affect N and Z flags. When instructions modify memory, addressing mode differs from implied or accumulator.

No Address:  Accumulator Mode
-----------------------------

We have observed that the shift and rotate instructions, ASL, ROL, LSR, and
ROR, allow data manipulation in either the A register or directly in memory.
When we want to use the A register, or accumulator, you should note this fact
as you code your program.  For example, you would write ASL A.

Where accumulator mode addressing is used, it has the same characteristics as
implied addressing:  the whole instruction fits into one byte.

Where the shift/rotate instructions refer to a memory location, an address
will of course be needed.  These address modes will be described later.

Other than the shift and rotate instructions, there is one other set of
instructions that manipulates memory directly.  You may recall INX, INY, DEX,
and DEY increment or decrement an index register.

INC (increment memory) adds one to any memory location.  DEC (decrement
memory) subtracts one from any memory location.  Both instructions affect the
N and Z flags.

When an instruction modifies memory, the address mode is neither implied nor
accumulator.  Memory reference addressing will be discussed later.
