# COMMODORE 64 - Warning that BASIC variables can overlay the high-resolution screen memory; if more memory is needed, move BASIC's top down or move the bitmap area. This issue applies to BASIC only, not machine language.

  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | WARNING: BASIC variables can overlay your high-resolution screen. If  |
  | you need more memory space you must move the bottom of BASIC above the|
  | high-resolution screen area. Or, you must move your high-resolution   |
  | screen area. This problem will NOT occur in machine language. It ONLY |
  | happens when you're writing programs in BASIC.                        |
