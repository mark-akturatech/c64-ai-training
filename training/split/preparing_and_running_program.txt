# MACHINE - Preparation before running the swap program: initialize memory locations $0380/$0381 to known values (example: 11 and 99) via .M editing, then run the program with .G 033C. Notes that execution is extremely fast, BRK returns to MLM with B* display, and suggests checking register changes and memory to confirm the swap.

                                                                         :19:

If everything looks in order, you're ready to run your first machine language
program.


Preparation
-----------

There's one more thing that we need to do.  If we want to swap the contents
of addresses $0380 and $0381, we'd better put something into those two
locations so that we'll know that the swap has taken place correctly.

Display memory with .M 0380 0381 and set the resulting display so that the
values are

  .:0380 11 99 xx xx xx xx xx xx

Remember to press RETURN.  Now we may run our program; we start it up with

  .G 033C

The program runs so quickly that it seems instantaneous (the run time is less
that one fifty thousandth of a second).  The last instruction in our program
was BRK for break, and that sends us straight to the MLM with a display of B*
(for break, of course) plus all the registers.

Nothing seems to have changed.  But wait.  Look carefully at the register
display.  Can you explain the values you see in the AC and XR registers?  Can
you explain the PC value?

Now you may display the data values we planned to exchange.  Give the memory
display command .M 0380 0831--have the contents of the two locations changed?

They'd better have changed.  Because that's what the writing of our program
was all about.
