# COMMODORE 64 - Introduction to constants and the three recognized types in CBM BASIC: integer, floating-point and strings. Integer constants details: whole numbers, valid range (-32768..+32767), storage as two-byte binary, examples and note not to use commas inside numbers.

  INTEGER, FLOATING-POINT AND STRING CONSTANTS

    Constants are the data values that you put in your BASIC statements.
  BASIC uses these values to represent data during statement execution.
  CBM BASIC can recognize and manipulate three types of constants:

    1) INTEGER NUMBERS
    2) FLOATING-POINT NUMBERS
    3) STRINGS

    Integer constants are whole numbers (numbers without decimal points).
  Integer constants must be between -32768 and +32767. Integer constants
  do not have decimal points or commas between digits. If the plus (+) sign
  is left out, the constant is assumed to be a positive number. Zeros
  coming before a constant are ignored and shouldn't be used since they
  waste memory and slow down your program. However, they won't cause an
  error. Integers are stored in memory as two-byte binary numbers. Some
  examples of integer constants are:

                               -12
                              8765
                            -32768
                               +44
                                 0
                            -32767
