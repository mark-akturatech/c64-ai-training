# ********* - SQR (move FAC1 to FAC2, load 0.5 into FAC1 and fall through to exponentiation) and FPWRT (perform exponentiation: raise FAC2 to the power FAC1 and leave result in FAC1). Covers square-root operation entry and general power calculation called by UPARROW.

49009         $BF71          SQR
Perform SQR

This routine moves the contents of FAC1 to FAC2, moves the constant
0.5 to FAC1, and falls through to the exponentation routine.

49019         $BF7B          FPWRT
Performs Exponentation (Power Calculation Called for by UPARROW)

This routine raises the value in FAC2 to the power in FAC1 and leaves
the result in FAC1.
