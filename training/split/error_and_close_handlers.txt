# byRiclianll - Error and close handler routines used by various failure branches. Prints the returned EN*, EM*, ET*, ES* status codes, displays a FAILED message (with visual emphasis markers), closes the appropriate channel (15 or 2), and ends execution. Several labels handle different failure contexts (closing channel 15, closing channel 2, or reading final status and then closing).
