# ca65 Users Guide - Introduction to macros and the simplest form: macros without parameters. Explains that macros are token sequences replaced at expansion. Shows a simple .macro/.endmacro example (asr) and how macro expansion inserts the instructions into code.

12. Macros
12.1 Introduction
Macros may be thought of as "parametrized super instructions". Macros are sequences of tokens that have a name. If that name is used in the source file, the macro is "expanded", that is, it is replaced by the tokens that were specified when the macro was defined.

12.2 Macros without parameters
In its simplest form, a macro does not have parameters. Here's an example:


.macro  asr             ; Arithmetic shift right
        cmp     #$80    ; Put bit 7 into carry
        ror             ; Rotate right with carry
.endmacro
The macro above consists of two real instructions, that are inserted into the code, whenever the macro is expanded. Macro expansion is simply done by using the name, like this:


        lda     $2010
        asr
        sta     $2010
