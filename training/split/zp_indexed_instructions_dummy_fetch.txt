# NMOS 6510 - Zero-page indexed instruction behaviour: explains that ZP-indexed instructions perform a dummy fetch from the zero-page address before adding the index. Lists example instructions (ADC zp,X STY zp,X AND zp,X CMP zp,X EOR zp,X etc) and shows the per-cycle sequence including the dummy DO fetch and subsequent data read/write.
