# byRiclianll - BASIC STR$ helper (lines 1290–1320) and marker for machine-code area. STR$ formats track (T) and sector (S) as two-character strings using RIGHT$ and LEN manipulation, then RETURN. Followed by a REM marker indicating the upcoming machine-code block at $C000.


1290  REM  STR*(T,S> 

1300  T*=R I GHT* ( " 0 " +R I 6HT* ( STR* ( T ) , LEN ( ST 
R*(T) )-l) ,2) 

1310  S*=RIGHT*("0"+RIGHT*(STR*(S) ,LEN(ST 
R*(S) )-l) ,2) 
1320  RETURN 
1330  REM  *C000
