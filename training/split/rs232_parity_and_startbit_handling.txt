# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Handles RS-232 receiver bit processing and parity/start-bit management. Examines flags (B5,B6), shifts temporary receiver bit storage ($A7), compares with the RS232 parity byte ($BD) and sets/clears carry/zero as needed. Computes nibble ($AA) counts, decrements counters, sets buffer start conditions, and may call the routine to copy the I/O start address to the buffer (JSR $FB8E). Sets serial status bits (via JSR $FE1C) to indicate short-block or parity conditions and branches to the common interrupt-restore exit where appropriate.

Additional information can be found by searching:
- "store_character_entry_and_initial_timing" which expands on This logic is reached from the entry/timing checks when serial-status bits select the RS232 path
- "buffer_copy_and_load_store" which expands on When a byte or start-of-buffer is accepted this code calls FB8E and then control flows into buffer-copy/load handling
