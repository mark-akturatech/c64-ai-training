# byRiclianll - Shows the decision to chain on from track 16, sector 11 to track 16, sector 02 and provides the 'TRACK 16 - SECTOR 02' header with its byte/ASCII dump lines (.00:, .08:, .10:). Includes brief commentary that again nothing much of interest appears and prepares to chain to the subsequent block (track 16, sector 12).

Nothing  much  of  interest  here.  Let's  chain  to  track  16  ($10),  sector  02  ($02)  and  take 
a  look  at  the  start  of  the  next  block. 


TRACK   16  -  SECTOR  02 

.    00:    10  OC  B2  22  22  3A  99  22   " " : . "
