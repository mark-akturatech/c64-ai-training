# ML for C64 - Appendix J: Relative Files, Direct Access

                      many things can do this, it's usually necessary to
                      identify the specific source of the interrupt.
Kernal: (2) Commodore's operating system.
Label, symbolic address: (8) A name identifying a memory location.
Latch: (7) A flag that "locks in."
Load: (1) To bring information from memory into the processor.  A load
          operation is a copying activity; the information still remains in
          memory.
Logical file number: (8) The identity of a file as used by the programmer.
Logical operator: (3) An operation that affects individual bits within a
                      byte:  AND, ORA, and EOR.
Logical shift or rotate: (4) A shift that does not preserve the sign of a
                             signed number.
Machine code: (1) Instructions written in machine language.
Machine language: (1) The set of commands that allow you to give instructions
                      to the processor.

                                                                        :320:

Machine language monitor: (1) A program that allows communication with the
                              computer in a manner convenient for machine
                              language programming.
Memory: (1) The storage used by a computer; every location is identified by
            an address.
Memory mapped: (1) Circuits that can be reached by the use of a memory
                   address, even though they are not used for storage or
                   memory purposes.
Memory page: (5) A set of 256 locations in memory, all of whose addresses
                 have the same "high byte."
Microcomputer: (1) A computer system containing a microprocessor, memory, and
                   input/output circuits.  A computer built using microchips.
Microprocessor: (1) The central logic of a microcomputer, containing logic
                    and arithmetic.  A processor built on a microchip.
Monitor: (1) A program that allows the user to communicate with the computer.
             Alternatively, a video screen device.
Non-maskable interrupt, NMI: (7) A type of interrupt that cannot be disabled.
Non-symbolic assembler: (2) An assembler in which actual addresses must be
                            used.
Object code: (1) The machine language program that will run in the computer.
Octothorpe: (2) Sometimes called a numbers sign, a pounds sign, a hash mark.
                The "#" symbol.
Operand: (1) The part of an instruction following the op code that usually
             signals where in memory the operation is to take place.
Operating system: (1) A set of programs with the computer that takes care of
                      general work such as input/output, timing, and so on.
Operation code, op code: (1) The part of an instruction that says what to do.
Overflow: (3) Condition caused by an arithmetic operation generating a result
              that is too big to fit in the space provided.
Pointer: (6) An address held in memory, usually in two bytes.
Processor status word, status register: (3) A processor register that holds
                                            status flags.
Pull: (7) To take something from the stack.
Push: (7) To put something on the stack.
Random access memory, RAM: (1) The part of a computer's memory where
                               information can be stored and recalled.
Read: (1) To obtain information from a device.
Read only memory, ROM: (1) The part of a computer's memory where fixed
                           information has been stored.  New information
                           cannot be stored in a ROM; it is preprogrammed.

                                                                        :321:

Register: (1) Location within a processor where information can be held
              temporarily.
Screen editing: (1) The ability to change the screen of a computer and cause
                    a corresponding change in memory.
Screen memory: (2) The part of a computer holding the information displayed
                   on the screen.  Changing screen memory will change the
                   screen; reading screen memory will reveal what is on the
                   screen.
Selected: (1) A chip or device that has been signaled to participate in a
              data transfer.  If the chip or device has not been selected, it
              will ignore data operations.
Self-modifying: (7) A type of program that changes itself as it runs.  Rare,
                    and not always considered good programming practice.
Signed number: (3) A number that holds a value that may be either positive or
                   negative.
Source code: (1) Instructions written in assembly language; usually, the
                 first code written by the programmer before performing an
                 assembly.
Stack: (7) A temporary, or "scratch pad," set of memory locations.
Status register, processor status word: (3) Within the processor, a register
                                            that holds status flags.
Store: (1) To transfer information from the processor to memory.  The store
           operation is a copying activity:  the information still remains in
           the processor.
Subroutine: (2) A set of instructions that can be called up by another
                program.
Symbolic address, label: (7) A name identifying a memory location.
Symbolic assembler: (2) An assembler in which symbolic addresses may be used.
                        This is more powerful than a non-symbolic assembler.
Testable flag: (3) A flag that can be tested by means of a conditional
                   branch instruction.
Two's complement: (3) A method of representing negative numbers.  With single
                      byte numbers, -1 would be represented by $FF.
Unsigned number: (3) A number that cannot have a negative value.
Write: (1) To send information to a device.
Zero page: (5) The lowest 256 locations in memory.  Locations whose addresses
               begin with hexadecimal $00.

                                                                        :322:
