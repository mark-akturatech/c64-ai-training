# NMOS 6510 - Undocumented immediate-mode NOPs (DOP / SKB): opcodes $80, $82, $C2, $E2, $89. Each shown as 'NOP #imm' with action 'Fetch #imm', size = 2 bytes, cycles = 2. Includes a note that some sources incorrectly claim $82/$C2/$E2 may JAM; authors conclude they behave as no-ops on the vast majority of machines and advise caution.

Note: One of the “classic” sources claims that NOP opcodes $82, $C2, $E2 may be JAMs. Since
neither looking at the way these opcodes are decoded can back this up, nor any other sources
corroborate this, it is probably plain wrong, or at least must be true only on very few machines. On
all others, these opcodes always perform 'no operation'. It is perhaps a good idea to avoid using
them anyway.
