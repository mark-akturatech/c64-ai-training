# ca65 Users Guide - Special SWEET16 mode: pseudo 16-bit interpreter semantics (R0..R15 registers reserved, '@' as indirect addressing, no interpreter/code stubs provided). Notes about how macros and character translation behave in this mode.

sweet16 mode
SWEET 16 is an interpreter for a pseudo 16 bit CPU written by Steve Wozniak for the Apple ][ machines. It is available in the Apple ][ ROM. ca65 can generate code for this pseudo CPU when switched into sweet16 mode. The following is special in sweet16 mode:


The '@' character denotes indirect addressing and is no longer available for cheap local labels. If you need cheap local labels, you will have to switch to another lead character using the .LOCALCHAR command.
Registers are specified using R0 .. R15. In sweet16 mode, these identifiers are reserved words.
Please note that the assembler does neither supply the interpreter needed for SWEET 16 code, nor the zero page locations needed for the SWEET 16 registers, nor does it call the interpreter. All this must be done by your program. Apple ][ programmers do probably know how to use sweet16 mode.
