# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Manages copying received bytes into the receive buffer memory and related load/store bookkeeping. Checks flag $B5 and ORs status into the serial-status byte (JSR $FE1C) when needed. Calls the read/write-pointer check (JSR $FCD1) to detect buffer-end and branches to pointer-wrap/exit if necessary. Uses $A7 as a temporary receiver-bit counter; if loading, sets up Y=0 and compares the received RS232 byte ($BD) with the buffer byte at ($AC),Y. If loading a new byte, sets up X and $9E index and writes the incoming bytes to $0100+X (storing $AD and $AC), increments X, and stores the updated index back to $9E before jumping to the further completion/verify stage.
