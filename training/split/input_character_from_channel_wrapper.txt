# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Wrapper at $FFCF that JMPs ($0324) to input a character from the current input channel (CHRIN). For keyboard input it handles line editing and buffering into BASIC input buffer; returns character in A.

                                *** input character from channel
                                this routine will get a byte of data from the channel already set up as the input
                                channel by the CHKIN routine, $FFC6.
                                
                                If CHKIN, $FFC6, has not been used to define another input channel the data is
                                expected to be from the keyboard. the data byte is returned in the accumulator. the
                                channel remains open after the call.
                                
                                input from the keyboard is handled in a special way. first, the cursor is turned on
                                and it will blink until a carriage return is typed on the keyboard. all characters
                                on the logical line, up to 80 characters, will be stored in the BASIC input buffer.
                                then the characters can be returned one at a time by calling this routine once for
                                each character. when the carriage return is returned the entire line has been
                                processed. the next time this routine is called the whole process begins again.
