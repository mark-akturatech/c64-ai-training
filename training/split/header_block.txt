# Datassette Encoding - Format of the 192-byte header block (fields and header types): Byte 1 = Header Type; Bytes 2-3 = Start address (low/high); Bytes 4-5 = End address (low/high); Bytes 6-21 = 16-byte filename (displayed); Bytes 22-192 = 171 bytes of filename area not displayed (padded with spaces $20). Header type values: $01 relocatable BASIC; $02 data block for sequential ASCII file; $03 non-relocatable program (machine language); $04 ASCII file header; $05 End-of-tape marker (EOT). Filenames shorter than 16 characters are space-padded (ASCII $20).
