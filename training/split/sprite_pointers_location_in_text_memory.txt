# Contents - Location of the 8 sprite pointers: VIC reads the eight sprite pointers from the last eight bytes of the 1K of text memory, at an offset of $03F8 from the text base address. Since only 1000 of 1024 text bytes are used visually, sprite pointers don't interfere with screen characters. Example: default text base $0400 -> first sprite pointer at $07F8.


The VIC chip will read the eight sprite pointers 
from the last eight bytes of the IK of text memory, 



30 



an offset of $03F8 from the text base address. Since 
only 1000 out of 1024 bytes of text memory are 
used to display characters on the screen, the sprite 
pointers will not interfere with screen graphics. For 
example, since the default setting of the text 
memory is at $0400, the first sprite pointer will be 
$07F8.
