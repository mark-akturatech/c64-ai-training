# COMMODORE 64 - How to PRINT symbols like $ next to numeric values: put $ inside quotes or store it in a string variable (Z$="$") and PRINT Z$A. Explanation why $ must be printed as a string, not directly attached to numeric variable names.

~


    Now let's say that you wanted a dollar sign ($) in front of the number
  represented by variable C. The $ must be PRINTed inside quotes and in
  front of variable C. To add the $ to your program hit the <RUN/STOP>
  and <RESTORE> keys. Now type in line 40 as follows:

    40 PRINT"$" C

  Now hit <RETURN>, type RUN and hit <RETURN> again.
  The dollar sign goes in quotes because the variable C only represents
  a number and can't contain a $. If the number represented by C was
  100 then the Commodore 64 screen would display $ 100. But, if you
  tried to PRINT $C without using the quotes, you would get a ?SYNTAX
  ERROR message.
    One last tip about $$$: You can create a variable that represents a
  dollar sign which you can then substitute for the $ when you want to use
  it with numeric variables. For example:

    10 Z$="$"

  Now whenever you need a dollar sign you can use the string variable
  Z$. Try this:

    10 Z$="$": INPUT A
    20 PRINT Z$A

  line 10 defines the $ as a string variable called Z$, and then INPUTs a
  number called A. line 20 PRINTs Z$ ($) next to A (number).
    You'll probably find that it's easier to assign certain characters,
  like dollar signs, to a string variable than to type "$" every time you
  want to calculate dollars or other items which require "" like %.
