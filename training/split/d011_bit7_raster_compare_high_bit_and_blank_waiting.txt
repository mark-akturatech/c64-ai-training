# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - D011 Bit 7: High bit (bit 8) of the Raster Compare register ($D012). Note about testing this bit using the Negative flag (BPL/BMI) in machine language to wait for vertical blank (example: LOOP LDA $D011 / BPL LOOP) and advice to move sprites during vertical blanking to avoid wobble. BASIC WAIT 53265,128 is the equivalent but often too slow.

                          Bit 7.  Bit 7 of this register is the high-order bit (Bit 8) of the
                          Raster Compare register at 53266 ($D012).  Even though it is located
                          here, it functions as part of that register (see the description below
                          for more information on the Raster Compare register).

                          Machine language programmers should note that its position here at Bit
                          7 allows testing this bit with the Negative flag.  Since scan lines
                          above number 256 are all off the screen, this provides an easy way to
                          delay changing the graphics display until the scan is in the vertical
                          blanking interval and the display is no longer being drawn:

                              LOOP  LDA $D011
                                    BPL LOOP

                          Sprites should always be moved when the raster is scanning off-screen,
                          because if they are moved while they are being scanned, their shapes
                          will waver slightly.

                          The BASIC equivalent of the program fragment above is the statement
                          WAIT 53265,128, but BASIC is usually not fast enough to execute the
                          next statement while still in the blanking interval.
