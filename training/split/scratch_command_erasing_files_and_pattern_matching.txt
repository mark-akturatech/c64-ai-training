# ********* - Section 4.5: SCRATCH command to delete files (PRINT#15,"S:name") and support for pattern matching/wildcards to delete multiple files at once; note about checking the error channel for the number of files scratched.



4.5 SCRATCH

This command allows you to erase unwanted files and programs from the
disk, which then makes the blocks available for new information.  You
can erase programs one at a time or in groups by using pattem matching
and or wild cards.

FORMAT FOR SCRATCH COMMAND

   PRINT# 15, "SCRATCH:name"

or abbreviated as

   PRINT# 15, "S:name"

If you check the error channel after a scratch operation (see below),
the number usually reserved for the track number now tells you how
many files were scratched.  For example, if your directory contains
the programs KNOW and GNAW, and you use the command PRINT# 15,
"S:?N?W", you will scratch both programs.  If the directory contains
TEST, TRAIN, TRUCK, and TAIL, and you command the disk to PRINT# 15,
"S:T*", you will erase all four of these programs.
