# COMMODORE 64 - DEF FN <name>(<variable>) = <expression>: defines a user function (FN prefix + name) that can be used later; saves space by defining a formula once. Function name is FN plus a 1-2 character identifier. DEF must be executed once; using FN before DEF causes UNDEF'D FUNCTION error. Examples of DEF FN and usage.




  DEF FN

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: DEF FN <name> ( <variable> ) = <expression>

    Action: This sets up a user-defined function that can be used later in
  the program. The function can consist of any mathematical formula. User-
  defined functions save space in programs where a long formula is used in
  several places. The formula need only be specified once, in the
  definition statement, and then it is abbreviated as a function name. It
  must be executed once, but any subsequent executions are ignored.
    The function name is the letters FN followed by any variable name. This
  can be 1 or 2 characters, the first being a letter and the second a
  letter or digit.

  EXAMPLES of DEF FN Statement:

    10 DEF FN A(X)=X+7
    20 DEF FN AA(X)=Y*Z
    30 DEF FN A9(Q) = INT(RND(1)*Q+1)

    The function is called later in the program by using the function name
  with a variable in parentheses. This function name is used like any other
  variable, and its value is automatically calculated,

  EXAMPLES of FN Use:

    40 PRINT FN A(9)
    50 R=FN AA(9)
    60 G=G+FN A9(10)

    In line 50 above, the number 9 inside the parentheses does not affect
  the outcome of the function, because the function definition in line 20
  doesn't use the variable in the parentheses. The result is Y times Z,
  regardless of the value of X. In the other two functions, the value in
  parentheses does affect the result.
