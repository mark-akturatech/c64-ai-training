# COMMODORE 64 - Sprite-to-sprite collisions are flagged in VIC-II register 53278 ($D01E). Each sprite has a bit that gets set to 1 if that sprite is involved in any sprite-sprite collision. Bits remain set until read (PEEK), after which the register is auto-cleared. Note: collisions can occur even when sprites are off-screen.


    One of the more interesting aspects of the VIC-II chip is its collision
  detection abilities. Collisions can be detected between sprites, or be-
  tween sprites and background data. A collision occurs when a non-zero
  part of a sprite overlaps a non-zero portion of another sprite or char-
  acters on the screen.

  SPRITE TO SPRITE COLLISIONS

    Sprite to sprite collisions are recognized by the computer, or flagged,
  in the sprite to sprite collision register at location 53278 ($D01E in
  HEX) in the VIC-II chip control register. Each sprite has a bit in this
  register. If that bit is a 1, then that sprite is involved in a
  collision. The bits in this register will remain set until read (PEEKed).
  Once read, the register is automatically cleared, so it is a good idea to
  save the value in a variable until you are finished with it.
