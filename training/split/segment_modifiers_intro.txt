# Kick Assembler - Introduces segment modifiers: functions that take memory blocks and output modified blocks (e.g., packers/crunchers). Explains built-in 'BasicUpstart' modifier that adds a $0801 basic upstart block to jump to a start address, controlled via the 'modify' parameter with modifier arguments prefixed by underscore (e.g., .segment Code [start=$8000, modify="BasicUpstart", _start=$8000]). Users can write modifiers as plug-ins.

// Main code
BasicUpstart2(start)
sei
ldx #0
lda zpCode,x
sta zpStart,x
inx
cpx #zpCodeSize
bne loop
jmp zpStart

zpCode: .segmentout [segments="ZeroPage_Code"]
.label zpCodeSize = *-zpCode
// Zeropage code
.segment ZeroPage_Code [start=$10]
zpStart:
inc $d020
jmp *-3
