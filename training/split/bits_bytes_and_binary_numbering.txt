# ********* - Explains bits and bytes: a byte is eight bits, combinations increase exponentially with each bit (examples for 1–3 bits), eight bits produce 256 combinations representing numbers 0–255. Compares binary (base 2) to decimal (base 10) and lists bit positions and their weights: Bit0=1 through Bit7=128.


Bits and Bytes

Each byte is make up of eight binary digits called bits.  These bits
are the computer's smallest unit of information.  They can contain
only the number one or the number zero, but when combined, they can be
used to form any number needed.  To see how that is possible, let's
look at a single bit.

A single bit can only be a one or a zero.  But if two bits are
combined the number increases.

00,01,10,11

That makes four possible combinations.  And if a third bit is added:

000,001,010,011,100,101,110,111

When eight bits are put together, the number of combinations increases
to 256.  These eight bits are called a byte and can be used to
represent the numbers from 0 to 255.

This system of numbering is known as binary (or base two).  It works
much like the decimal (base ten) system.  In the base ten numbering
system, the rightmost digit is known as the one's place, and holds a
number from 0 to 9.  The next place to the left is known as then ten's
place, and also holds a number from 0 to 9, which represents the
number of times the one's place has been used in counting (the number
of tens).

In the binary system, there is a one's place, then a two's place, a
four's place, etc.  The bits are counted from right to left, starting
with Bit 0.  Here are the values of each bit:

Bit 0 = 1
Bit 1 = 2
Bit 2 = 4
Bit 3 = 8
Bit 4 = 16
Bit 5 = 32
Bit 6 = 64
Bit 7 = 128
