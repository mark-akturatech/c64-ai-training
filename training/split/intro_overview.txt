  COMMODORE 64 APPLICATIONS GUIDE

    When you first thought about buying a computer you probably asked
  yourself, "Now that I can afford to buy a computer, what can I do with
  it once I get one?"
    The great thing about your COMMODORE 64 is that you can make it do what
  YOU want it to do! You can make it calculate and keep track of home and
  business budget needs. You can use it for word processing. You can make
  it play arcade-style action games. You can make it sing. You can even
  create your own animated cartoons, and more. The best part of owning a
  COMMODORE 64 is that even if it did only one of the things listed below
  it would be well worth the price you paid for it. But the 64 is a
  complete computer and it does do EVERYTHING listed and then some!
