  ATN

  TYPE: Function-Numeric
  FORMAT: ATN(<number>)

    Action: This mathematical function returns the arctangent of the
  number. The result is the angle (in radians) whose tangent is the number
  given. The result is always in the range -pi/2 to +pi/2.

  EXAMPLES of ATN Function:

    10 PRINT ATN(0)
    20 X = ATN(J)*180/ {pi} : REM CONVERT TO DEGREES
