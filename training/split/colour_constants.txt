Special Features

14.5. Making 3D Calculations
To make it easy to to make 3D Calculations, Kick Assembler supports vector and matrix values.
Vector values are used to hold 3D vectors. They are created by the Vector function that takes x, y and z as
argument:
.var v1 = Vector(1,2,3)
.var v2 = Vector(0,0,2)

You can access the coordinates of the vector by its get functions and do the most common vector operations
by the assigned functions. Here are some examples:
.var v1PlusV2 = v1+v2
.print "V1 scaled by 10 is " +
.var dotProduct = v1*v2

(v1*10)

Here is a list of vector functions and operators:
