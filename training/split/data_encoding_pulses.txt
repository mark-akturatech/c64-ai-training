# Analyzing C64 tape loaders - Explains that C64 cassette data is encoded as square-wave pulses. Defines three standard CBM pulse periods/frequencies: long (≈672µs, 1488Hz), medium (≈512µs, 1953Hz), short (≈352µs, 2840Hz). Notes that data bits are encoded using medium+short pulses and explains that pulse names refer to the period.






==== Data Encoding ====

Each bit of data or program sent to the C2N is encoded by the operating system using audio frequencies: that means square waves with a 50% duty cycle, often referred to as //pulses// (this is also the term I'll often be using moving forward).\\
A sequence of bits is therefore encoded as a sequence of square waves on tape, back-to-back.

The standard Commodore encoding method uses three distinct pulses:

  * "long pulses" with a frequency of 1488 Hz (period = 672 microseconds about),
  * "medium pulses" at 1953 Hz (period = 512 microseconds about),
  * "short pulses" at 2840 Hz (period = 352 microseconds about).

It is evident that each name refers to the period (period = 1/frequency) of the square wave rather than to its frequency.\\
Data bits are encoded by a couple of pulses (medium and short pulses are used). The structure of this loader is discussed in the [[loaders:ROM_Loader|CBM Loader]] page. You may give it a look when done with the following paragraph about Tap format. The software details of CBM loader are discussed in Nick Hampshire's book mentioned above.
