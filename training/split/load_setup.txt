# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - LOAD: LOAD RAM entry (vectored from $ffd5). Stores relocated load address (MEMUSS) in $C3/$C4 via STX/STY and jumps to the ILOAD vector ($0330). Sets VERCK ($93) flag for load/verify and clears STATUS ($90). Checks FA ($BA) for illegal devices (keyboard or screen => I/O error #9).

                                *** LOAD: LOAD RAM
                                The kernal routine LOAD ($ffd5) is vectored here. If a
                                relocated load is desired, then the start address is set
                                in MEMUSS. The load/verify flag is set, and the I/O status
                                word is reset. A test is done on the device number, less
                                than 3 results in illegal device number.
