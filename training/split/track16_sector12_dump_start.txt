# byRiclianll - Beginning of the listing for 'TRACK 16 - SECTOR 12': a short lead-in remark ('Again, nothing much of interest.'), the sector header, and the start of the byte dump for this sector (lines labeled 00: and following byte values). This chunk contains the initial fragment of the sector's raw bytes shown at the end of the original oversized chunk.

Again,  nothing  much  of  interest.  Chain  to  track  16  ($10),  sector  12  ($0C).
