# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Entry to the KERNAL 'store character' routine. Calls new tape-byte setup (JSR $FB97), clears the byte-received flag ($9C), sets max byte timing (LDX #$DA) and invokes timing setup (JSR $F8E2). Loads the copies count ($BE) and, if non-zero, saves temporary receiver-input-bit storage ($A7). Tests serial-status bits ($AA) and branches into short-block/copies handling or early-exit paths. Sets short-block status and jumps to the common interrupt restore/exit when appropriate.
