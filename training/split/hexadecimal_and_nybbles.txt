# ********* - Introduces the hexadecimal (base 16) numbering system: digits 0–9 and A–F (A=10 … F=15). Explains that two hex digits represent one byte (16*16=256 combinations) and that each hex digit maps to four bits (a 'nybble'). Notes the convention in the book of prefixing hexadecimal numbers with a dollar sign ($).

Hexadecimal

One other numbering system that is used in speaking about computers is
the hexadecimal (base 16) system.  Each hexadecimal digit can count a
number from 0 to 15.  Since the highest numeric digit is 9, the
alphabet must be used:  A=10, B=11, and so on up to F=15.  With just
two digits, 256 combinations are possible (16*16).  That means that
each byte can be represented by just two hexadecimal digits, each of
which stands for four bits of memory.  These four- bit units are
smaller than a byte, so they are known as nybbles.

Since programmers often find that hexadecimal numbers are easier to
use than binary or decimal numbers, many numbers in this book are
given in both decimal and hexadecimal format.  A dollar sign ($) has
been placed in front of each hexadecimal number.
