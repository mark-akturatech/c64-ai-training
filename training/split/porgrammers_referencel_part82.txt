  pins 3 and 4. Both capacitors should be the some value. Normal operation
  of the Filter over the audio range (approximately 30 Hz-12 kHz) is
  accomplished with a value of 2200 pF for C1 and C2. Polystyrene
  capacitors are preferred and in complex polyphonic systems, where many
  SID chips must track each other, matched capacitors are recommended.
    The frequency range of the Filter can be tailored to specific applica-
  tions by the choice of capacitor values. For example, a low-cost game may
  not require full high-frequency response. In this case, larger values
  for C1 and C2 could be chosen to provide more control over the bass
  frequencies of the Filter. The maximum Cutoff Frequency of the Filter is
  given by:

                             FCmax = 2.6E-5/C

  Where C is the capacitor value. The range of the Filter extends 9 octaves
  below the maximum Cutoff Frequency.

  RES (Pin 5)

    This TTL-level input is the reset control for SID. When brought low for
  at least ten 02 cycles, all internal registers are reset to zero and the
  audio output is silenced. This pin is normally connected to the reset
  line of the microprocessor or a power-on-clear circuit.

  02 (Pin 6)

    This TTL-Level input is the master clock for SID. All oscillator
  frequencies and envelope rates are referenced to this clock. 02 also
  controls data transfers between SID and the microprocessor. Data can only
  be transferred when (02 is high. Essentially, (02 acts as a high-active
  chip select as far as data transfers are concerned. This pin is normally
  connected to the system clock, with a nominal operating frequency of 1.0
  MHz.

  R/W  (Pin 7)

    This TTL-level input controls the direction of data transfers between
  SID and the microprocessor. If the chip select conditions have been met,
  a high on this line allows the microprocessor to Read data from the
  selected SID register and a low allows the microprocessor to Write data
  into the selected SID register. This pin is normally connected to the
  system Read/Write line.

  CS (Pin 8)

    This TTL-Level input is a low active chip select which controls data
  transfers between SID and the microprocessor. CS must be low for any
  transfer. A Read from the selected SID register can only occur if CS is
  low, 02 is high and R/W is high. A Write to the selected SID register can
  only occur if CS is low, (02 is high and R/W is low. This pin is normally
  connected to address decoding circuitry, allowing SID to reside in the
  memory map of a system.

  A0-A4 (Pins 9-13)

    These TTL-Level inputs are used to select one of the 29 SID registers.
  Although enough addresses are provided to select 1 of 32 registers, the
  remaining three register locations are not used. A Write to any of these
  three locations is ignored and a Read returns invalid data. These pins
  are normally connected to the corresponding address lines of the micro-
  processor so that SID may be addressed in the same manner as memory.

  GND (Pin 14)

    For best results, the ground line between SID and the power supply
  should be separate from ground lines to other digital circuitry. This
  will minimize digital noise at the audio output.
                                                           APPENDIX O   471

  D0-D7 (Pins 15-22)

    These bidirectional lines are used to transfer data between SID and the
  microprocessor. They are TTL compatible in the input mode and capable of
  driving 2 TTL loads in the output mode. The data buffers are usually in
  the high-impedance off state. During a Write operation, the data buffers
  remain in the off (input) state and the microprocessor supplies data to
  SID over these lines. During a Read operation, the data buffers turn on
  and SID supplies data to the microprocessor over these lines. The pins
  are normally connected to the corresponding data lines of the micro-
  processor.

  POTX,POTY (Pins 24,23)

    These pins are inputs to the A/D converters used to digitize the posi-
  tion of potentiometers. The conversion process is based on the time con-
  stant of a capacitor tied from the POT pin to ground, charged by a
  potentiometer tied from the POT pin to +5 volts. The component values are
  determined by:

                                RC = 4.7E-4

  Where R is the maximum resistance of the pot and C is the capacitor.
    The larger the capacitor, the smaller the POT value jitter. The recom-
  mended values for R and C are 470 komhs and 1000 pF. Note that a separate
  pot and cap are required for each POT pin.

  VCC (Pin 25)

    As with the GND line, a separate +5 VDC line should be run between SID
  Vcc and the power supply in order to minimize noise. A bypass capacitor
  should be located close to the pin.

  EXT IN (Pin 26)

    This analog input allows external audio signals to be mixed with the
  audio output of SID or processed through the Filter. Typical sources in-
  clude voice, guitar, and organ. The input impedance of this pin is on the
  order of 100 kohms. Any signal applied directly to the pin should ride at
  a DC level of 6 volts and should not exceed 3 volts p-p. In order to pre-



  472   APPENDIX O

  vent any interference caused by DC level differences, external signals
  should be AC-coupled to EXT IN by an electrolytic capacitor in the 1-10
  uF range. As the direct audio path (FILTEX=0) has unity gain, EXT IN can
  be used to mix outputs of many SID chips by daisy-chaining. The number of
  chips that can be chained in this manner is determined by the amount of
  noise and distortion allowable at the final output. Note that the output
  Volume control will affect not only the three SID voices, but also any
  external inputs.

  AUDIO OUT (Pin 27)

    This open-source buffer is the final audio output of SID, comprised of
  the three SID voices, the Filter and any external input. The output level
  is set by the output Volume control and reaches a maximum of 2 volts p-p
  at a DC level of 6 volts. A source resistor from AUDIO OUT to ground is
  required for proper operation. The recommended resistance is 1 kohm for
  a standard output impedance.
    As the output of SID rides at a 6-volt DC level, it should be AC-
  coupled to any audio amplifier with an electrolytic capacitor in the 1-10
  uF range.

  VDD (Pin 28)

    As with Vcc, a separate +12 VDC line should be run to SID VDD and a
  bypass capacitor should be used.
