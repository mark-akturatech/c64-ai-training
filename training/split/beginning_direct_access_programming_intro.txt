# byRiclianll - Beginning section to direct-access programming: transitions from chapter 2 housekeeping to the specialized direct-access commands recognized by the 1541; prepares reader for a list of the commands and their functions.


As  you  grow  with  your  1541,  the  need  for  routines  of  this  nature  will  become  increas- 
ingly apparent,  if  it  isn't  already.  This  chapter  illustrates  the  use  of  direct-access  com- 
mands in  simple  programs.  A  basic  understanding  of  the  function  of  these  commands 
is  necessary  to  appreciate  the  routines  found  in  subsequent  chapters  and  Appendix  C.
