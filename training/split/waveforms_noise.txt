# SID 6581/8580 Sound Interface Device - Programming Guide - Noise waveform: pseudo-random noise via 23-bit LFSR, LFSR shift rate controlled by frequency register (higher frequency = brighter noise), used for percussion/effects. Warning: selecting noise with other waveforms can lock LFSR; fix by writing TEST then desired waveform.

5.4 NOISE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Produces pseudo-random noise via a 23-bit LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Reg.)
  - The frequency register controls the shift rate of the LFSR
  - Higher frequency = faster shift rate = brighter noise
  - Lower frequency = slower shift rate = more rumbling noise
  - Used for percussion, explosions, wind, and other sound effects
  - WARNING: Selecting noise simultaneously with another waveform can lock
    the noise LFSR, producing silence. Reset by writing 0 then the desired
    waveform to the control register.
