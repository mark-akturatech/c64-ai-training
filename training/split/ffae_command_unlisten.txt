# C64 KERNAL API (Lee Davison) - $FFAE — Command serial bus to UNLISTEN. Transmits UNLISTEN to command devices to stop receiving data. Used after finishing data transmission; only affects devices previously commanded to LISTEN. Also used to clear output listeners on the bus.

$FFAE          command serial bus to UNLISTEN
               
               This routine commands all devices on the serial bus to stop receiving data from
               the computer. Calling this routine results in an UNLISTEN command being transmitted
               on the serial bus. Only devices previously commanded to listen will be affected.
               
               This routine is normally used after the computer is finished sending data to
               external devices. Sending the UNLISTEN will command the listening devices to get
               off the serial bus so it can be used for other purposes.
