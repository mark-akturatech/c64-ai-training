# COMMODORE 64 - Arithmetic expressions produce integer or floating-point results. Operators: + (addition), - (subtraction and unary minus), * (multiplication), / (division), ^ (exponentiation). Integers converted to floating-point during operations; results converted back to integers if assigned to integer variables.

  ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS

    An arithmetic operator defines an arithmetic operation which is per-
  formed on the two operands on either side of the operator. Arithmetic
  operations are performed using floating-point numbers. Integers are
  converted to floating-point numbers before an arithmetic operation is
  performed. The result is converted back to an integer if it is assigned
  to an integer variable name.

    ADDITION (+): The plus sign (+) specifies that the operand on the
  right is added to the operand on the left.
