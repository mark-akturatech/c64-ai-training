# MACHINE - Commodore 64: 'The Great Zero-Page Hunt' summary. Lists zero-page locations typically available for user programs ($FC-$FF, $22-$2A, $4E-$53, $57-$60) and warns about critical OS/BASIC zero-page locations that must not be modified (detailed ranges such as $13, $16-$18, $2B-$38, $53-$54, etc.).

Commodore 64
============


The Great Zero-Page Hunt
------------------------

Locations $FC to $FF are available.  Locations $22 to $2A, $4E to $53, and
$57 to $60 are work areas available for temporary use.

Most zero-page locations may be copied to another part of memory so that
their original contents can be restored after use.  The programmer should
take great care, however, in modifying the following locations, which are
critical within the operating system or BASIC:  $13, $16 to $18, $2B to $38,
$3A, $53 to $54, $68, $73 to $8A, $90 to $9A, $A0 to $A2, $B8 to $BA, $C5 to
$F4.
