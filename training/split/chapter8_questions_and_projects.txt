# MACHINE - Challenge exercises: count occurrences of 'S' or RETURN ($0D) in a sequential file using machine language; write programs to print repeated messages to printer; create machine-language equivalents of PRINT# to send DOS commands (e.g., scratch a file); write a typewriter utility program with delete handling.


Questions and Projects
----------------------

Write a program to read a sequential file and count the number of times the
letter "S" (hex 41) appears in the file.  Use a BASIC PEEK to print the
value.  You may assume that "A" will not appear more than 255 times.

                                                                        :146:

Rewrite the above to count the number of occurrences of the RETURN character
($0D) in a sequential file.  Allow for up to 65535 appearances.  Can you
attach a meaning to this count?

Write a program to print HAPPY NEW YEAR to the printer ten times.

If you own a disk system, you know that you can scratch a program named JUNK
by using the sequence:

  OPEN 15,8,15:PRINT#15,"S0:JUNK"

Convert the PRINT# statement to machine language a write a program to scratch
JUNK.  Careful:  don't scratch a program that you will need.

Write a "typewriter" program to read a line of text from the keyboard and
then transfer it to the printer.  It will be a more useful program if you
show what is being typed on the screen and if you write extra code to honor
the DELETE key.

                                                                        :147:
