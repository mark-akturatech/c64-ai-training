# The MOS 6567/6569 video controller (VIC-II) and its application in the Commodore 64 - Purpose and scope of the document: summary of VIC-II (MOS 6567/6569) examination, intended audience (C64 programmers, emulator authors), basis of investigations and contributors (Marko Mäkelä, Andreas Boose, Pasi Ojala, Wolfgang Lorenz, Christian Bauer).

1. Introduction
---------------

This paper is an attempt to summarize the results of various people's
examinations of the graphics chip "6567/6569 Video Interface Controller
(VIC-II)" (simply called "VIC" in the following) used in the legendary
Commodore 64, and to provide a complete reference to its specified and
unspecified properties. It is primarily intended for C64 programmers and
authors of C64 emulators, but should also be interesting to "outsiders"
interested in hardware design and programming and hacking a computer up to
the last bits. For this purpose, some general information (e.g. the C64
memory map) already known to experienced C64 programmers has been included
as well.

The description of the unspecified properties is based on tests done by
Marko M�kel�, Andreas Boose, Pasi Ojala, Wolfgang Lorenz and myself (not to
mention numerous others) during the last years. It also covers internal
registers and workings of the VIC. As no schematics of the VIC are
available it can of course only be speculative, but in all cases a model
has been chosen that explains the observed phenomena with the minimally
required circuitry. E.g. for the video matrix counter (VC), a model with
two simple counters was given preference to a more elaborate one with a +40
adder.

Although some measurements have been done with an oscilloscope directly on
the chip, most insights are based on test programs on the C64 and by
comparing them with the implementation in single cycle emulations like
"Frodo SC".
