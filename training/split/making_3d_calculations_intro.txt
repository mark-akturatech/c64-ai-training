# Kick Assembler - Introduces vector and matrix values to help with 3D calculations. Vector created with Vector(x,y,z). Examples: .var v1 = Vector(1,2,3) .var v2 = Vector(0,0,2). Vectors support arithmetic operators and functions (getX,getY,getZ, +, -, scaling, dot product, cross product X()).

Vector(1,2,3)/2

Divides each coordinate by a factor
and returns the result.

X(v)

Vector(0,1,0).X(Vector(1,0,0))

Returns the cross product between
two vectors.

The matrix value represents a 4x4 matrix. You create it by using the Matrix function, or one of the other
constructor functions described later. You access the entries of the matrix by using its get and set functions:
.var matrix = Matrix()
// Creates an identity matrix
.eval matrix.set(2,3,100)
.print "Matrix.get(2,3)=" + matrix.get(2,3)
.print "The entire matrix=" + matrix

In 3d graphics matrixes are usually used to describe a transformation of a vector space. That can be to move
