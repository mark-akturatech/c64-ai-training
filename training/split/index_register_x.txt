# Architecture of 6502 Microprocessor - Index Register X (8 bits). Typically used as a counter or memory offset; supports compare, increment, and decrement operations. Uniquely among index registers, X can be used to read or change a copy of the stack pointer.

Index Register X	8 bits		X

Usually used to hold counters or offsets for accessing memory.  Contents can be compared with memory locations and incremented and decremented.

Unlike other registers (including the Y register), can be used to get a copy of the stack pointer or change its value.
