# NMOS 6510 - Examples: using DCP when low byte is in accumulator to set carry and perform multi-byte decrement. Also showing how DCP can simulate addressing modes for DEC that the legal ISA lacks (DCP abs,y, DCP (zp),y, DCP (zp,x)).

DCP abs, y
; like DEC abs, y
DCP (zp), y
; like DEC (zp), y
DCP (zp, x)
; like DEC (zp, x)
; N,Z,C were set as with additional CMP

ISC (ISB, INS)
Type: Combination of two operations with the same addressing mode (Sub-instructions: INC, SBC)
Opc.

Mnemonic
