# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - MEMBOT: Read/Set bottom of memory (vectored from $ff9c). If carry set reads MEMSTR ($0281/$0282) into X/Y; if carry clear stores X/Y into MEMSTR via STX/STY. Handles BCC/LDX/LDY/STX/STY/RTS.

                                *** MEMBOT: READ/SET BOTTOM OF MEMORY
                                The KERNAL routine MEMBOT ($ff9c) jumps to this routine.
                                If carry is set on entry, the bottom of memory address
                                will be loaded into (X/Y). If carry is clear on entry, the
                                bottom of memory will set according to the contents in
                                (X/Y)
