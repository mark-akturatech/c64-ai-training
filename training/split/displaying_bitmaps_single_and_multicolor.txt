# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Displaying bitmaps: hires vs multicolour differences. Single-colour hires uses screen RAM upper/lower nybbles for two colours; multicolour uses colour RAM. Example: set $D011=$3B, $D016=$08 for single-colour, $D018 appropriately for screen and bitmap addresses.

Displaying Bitmaps
Displaying a single-colour bitmap is just like displaying a multi-colour bitmap, except that you don't use colour-RAM. Why? Because all you need is a background colour and a foreground colour, and you can use the good old screen RAM for that. For each byte in the screen RAM, you set the upper nybble to one colour value, and the lower nybble to another value (or the same value, but then you won't see anything of the bitmap).

The last paragraph might sound a bit cryptic, but just try it out. Get yourself a nice hires bitmap (use some utility to create one, it should output a file that is 33 blocks long). Load that bitmap to some $2000 aligned address (like $2000), set $d011 to $3b, $d016 to $08 (single colour mode) and $d018 to $18. Then you can start poking values into $0400 etc., to see what happens.

Does that sound too simple? It is simple.
