# COMMODORE 64 - SYNC (Bit 1): When set, synchronizes the fundamental frequency of Oscillator 1 to Oscillator 3 (Hard Sync). Explains sonic effect — Oscillator 1 produces harmonic structures at Oscillator 3's frequency when varied relative to Oscillator 3. Requirements: Oscillator 3 must have a non-zero frequency (preferably lower than Oscillator 1); other Voice 3 parameters do not affect sync.

    SYNC (Bit 1): The SYNC bit, when set to a one, synchronizes the
  fundamental frequency of Oscillator 1 with the fundamental frequency of
  Oscillator 3, producing "Hard Sync" effects.
    Varying the frequency of Oscillator 1 with respect to Oscillator 3 pro-
  duces a wide range of complex harmonic structures from Voice I at the
  frequency of Oscillator 3. In order for sync to occur, Oscillator 3 must
  be set to some frequency other than zero but preferably lower than the
  frequency of Oscillator 1. No other parameters of Voice 3 have any effect
  on sync.
