# COMMODORE 64 - Method 4: Change hardware IRQ vector to run custom interrupt handler every 1/60s. Useful for concurrent tasks; must usually chain to normal IRQ handler unless handling CIA. Replacement interrupt must end with RTI. WARNING: Always disable interrupts before changing IRQ vector.

    4) The HARDWARE INTERRUPT (IRQ) VECTOR can be changed. Every 1/60th of
       a second, the operating system transfers control to the routine
       specified by this vector. The KERNAL normally uses this for timing,
       keyboard scanning, etc. If this technique is used, you should always
       transfer control to the normal IRQ handling routine, unless the
       replacement routine is prepared to handle the CIA chip. (REMEMBER to
       end the routine with an RTI (ReTurn from Interrupt) if the CIA is
       handled by the routine).
         This method is useful for tasks which must happen concurrently
       with a BASIC program, but has the drawback of being more difficult.
