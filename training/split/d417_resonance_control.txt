# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $D417 (54295) RESON — Filter Resonance Control Register: bits 0-3 route voices/external input through the filter (bit0 voice1, bit1 voice2, bit2 voice3, bit3 external), bits 4-7 control resonance 0..15 (0=no resonance, 15=max).

$D417        RESON        Filter Resonance Control Register

                     0    Filter the output of voice 1?  1=yes
                     1    Filter the output of voice 2?  1=yes
                     2    Filter the output of voice 3?  1=yes
                     3    Filter the output from the external input?  1=yes
                     4-7  Select filter resonance 0-15

                          Bits 0-3 are used to control which of the voices will be altered by
                          the filters.  If one of these bits is set to 1, the corresponding
                          voice will be processed through the filter, and its harmonic content
                          will be changed accordingly.  If the bit is set to 0, the voice will
                          pass directly to the audio output.  Note that there is also a
                          provision for processing an external audio signal which is brought
                          through pin 5 of the Audio/Video Port.

                          Bits 4-7 control the resonance of the filter.  By placing a number
                          from 0 to 15 in these four bits, you may peak the volume of those
                          frequencies nearest the cutoff.  This creates an even sharper
                          filtering effect.  A setting of 0 causes no resonance, while a setting
                          of 15 gives maximum resonance.
