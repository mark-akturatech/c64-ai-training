# COMMODORE 64 - RETURN: used to exit a subroutine entered with GOSUB. Execution resumes at the next executable statement after the corresponding GOSUB. Notes on nesting: each GOSUB must match at least one RETURN. Example showing GOSUB/RETURN usage.

  RETURN

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: RETURN

    Action: The RETURN statement is used to exit from a subroutine called
  for by a GOSUB statement. RETURN restarts the rest of your program at
  the next executable statement following the GOSUB. If you are nesting
  subroutines, each GOSUB must be paired with at least one RETURN
  statement. A subroutine can contain any number of RETURN statements,
  but the first one encountered will exit the subroutine.

  EXAMPLE of RETURN Statement:

    10 PRINT"THIS IS THE PROGRAM"
    20 GOSUB 1000
    30 PRINT"PROGRAM CONTINUES"
    40 GOSUB 1000
    50 PRINT"MORE PROGRAM"
    60 END
    1000 PRINT"THIS IS THE GOSUB":RETURN
