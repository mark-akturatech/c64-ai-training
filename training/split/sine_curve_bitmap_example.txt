# COMMODORE 64 - BASIC example that uses the bitmap addressing formula to plot a sine curve across the screen: FOR X=0 TO 319 STEP .5 with Y=INT(90+80*SIN(X/10)), computes CH, RO, LN, BY, BI and POKEs the byte to set the bit: POKEBY,PEEK(BY)OR(2^BI). Sets a flag POKE 1024,16 and enters infinite loop afterwards.

    Let's add these calculations to the program. In the following example,
  the COMMODORE 64 will plot a sine curve:

  50 FORX=0TO319STEP.5:REM WAVE WILL FILL THE SCREEN
  60 Y=INT(90+80*SIN(X/10))
  70 CH=INT(X/8)
  80 RO=INT(Y/8)
  85 LN=YAND7
  90 BY=BASE+RO*320+8*CH+LN
  100 BI=7-(XAND7)
  110 POKEBY,PEEK(BY)OR(2^BI)
  120 NEXTX
  125 POKE1024,16
  130 GOTO130
