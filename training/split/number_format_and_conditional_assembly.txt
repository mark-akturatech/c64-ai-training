# ca65 Users Guide - Number formats accepted by ca65: hex with leading '$' or trailing 'h', binary with '%', decimal bare number; no octal or floats. Conditional assembly caveat: tokens in unassembled branches still tokenized so directives must be syntactically valid.

4.2 Number format
For literal values, the assembler accepts the widely used number formats: A preceding '$' or a trailing 'h' denotes a hex value, a preceding '%' denotes a binary value, and a bare number is interpreted as a decimal. There are currently no octal values and no floats.

4.3 Conditional assembly
Please note that when using the conditional directives (.IF and friends), the input must consist of valid assembler tokens, even in .IF branches that are not assembled. The reason for this behaviour is that the assembler must still be able to detect the ending tokens (like .ENDIF), so conversion of the input stream into tokens still takes place. As a consequence conditional assembly directives may not be used to prevent normal text (used as a comment or similar) from being assembled.
