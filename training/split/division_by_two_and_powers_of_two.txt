# 6502 Multiplication and Division Algorithms - Source: llx.com - Division by 2: use LSR for single-byte, and for two-byte use LSR NUMHI then ROR NUMLO to shift right across two bytes. Remainder returned in the carry flag. For higher powers of two, repeat shifts; remainder bits are the bits shifted into carry (lowest bit shifted out is lowest remainder bit, etc.). Notes that dividing by non-power-of-two constants is harder and often general division is preferable if remainder needed.

Division
----------------------------------------


Passing over the trivial case of dividing by 1, the easiest number to
divide by is 2:


LSR NUM


Or, for two-byte numbers:


LSR NUMHI
        ROR NUMLO


This replaces the original number with the result, and leaves the
remainder in the carry flag.


As with multiplication, dividing by higher powers of two is simply a
matter of repeating the above.  The remainder can be found by saving
the bits shifted off into the carry flag - the first bit shifted out is
the lowest bit of the remainder, the second bit shifted is the
next-to-lowest bit of the remainder, and so on.


Unfortunately, dividing by constants that are not powers of two is
harder than multiplying by them - hard enough that it's often easiest
just to go for the general divide-anything-by-anything routine,
especially if you need the remainder.
