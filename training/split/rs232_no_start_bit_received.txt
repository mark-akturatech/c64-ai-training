# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Handler executed when no RS-232 start bit was detected. Checks the current data bit and, if still idle, loops to the routine that sets up to receive the next RS-232 bit. If a start bit is detected it jumps to flag the start and set parity.

                                *** no RS232 start bit received
.,EF90 A5 A7    LDA $A7         get the RS232 received data bit
.,EF92 D0 EA    BNE $EF7E       if ?? go setup to receive an RS232 bit and return
.,EF94 4C D3 E4 JMP $E4D3       flag the RS232 start bit and set the parity
