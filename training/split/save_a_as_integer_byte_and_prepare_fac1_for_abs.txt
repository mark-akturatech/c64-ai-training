# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Save A as integer byte and prepare FAC1 for ABS/normalisation: store the sign/indicator into FAC1 mantissa1 ($62), clear mantissa bytes 2 and 3, set exponent to $88, complement mantissa1 and rotate sign into carry, clear mantissa 3 and 4, store exponent, clear rounding byte and sign bit, then jump to the ABS+normalise routine.

Additional information can be found by searching:
- "perform_sgn" which expands on uses the sign result saved in A to create an integer byte
- "abs_fac1" which expands on clears the sign bit and returns; this code prepares FAC1 then jumps to ABS+normalise
