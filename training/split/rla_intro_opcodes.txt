# NMOS 6510 - RLA (also shown as RLN) undocumented opcode introduction and opcode table header. States the type (combination of ROL then AND), lists sub-instructions (ROL, AND), and begins the opcode table with entries such as $27 -> RLA zp and $37. Shows the function line ({addr} = rol {addr}) and the start of the size/cycle table header.
