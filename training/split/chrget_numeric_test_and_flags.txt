# MACHINE - Shows pseudocode of CHRGOT: LDA $xxxx; CMP #$3A; BCS EXIT (colon test); CMP #$20; BEQ CHRGET (skip spaces). Demonstrates an odd but correct test sequence using SEC; SBC #$30; SEC; SBC #$D0 which leaves A unchanged but sets C if < $30 and Z if zero—achieving the numeric test and setting flags as required. Exit via RTS.


  3.  If we find a numeric, we wish the C flag to be clear; if we do not find
      a numeric, we wish the C flag to be set.


  CHRGOT  LDA $xxxx
          CMP #$3A
          BCS EXIT

If the character is a colon ($3A), we'll leave the subroutine with the Z flag
set.  That's one of our objectives.  Here's part of another one:  if the
character is $3A or higher, it can't possibly be an ASCII numeric--numerics
are in the range of $30 to $39.

          CMP #$20
          BEQ CHRGET

If the character is a space, we go back and get another character.

                                                                        :124:

The following code looks rather strange, but it's correct.  After the two
subtractions, the A register will be back where it started:

          SEC
          SBC #$30
          SEC
          SBC #$D0

After this, the A register is not changed; but the C flag will be set if the
number is less than $30, which means that it is not an ASCII numeric.
Additionally, the Z flag will be set if A contains a binary zero.  We have
met all of our objectives and may now return:

  EXIT    RTS
