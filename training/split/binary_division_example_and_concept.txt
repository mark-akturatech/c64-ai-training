# 6502 Multiplication and Division Algorithms - Source: llx.com - Binary long division example showing repetitive trial-subtractions where each step subtracts either 0 or the divisor. Demonstrates easier branching because only two subtractions possible. Explains the high-level code approach: shift dividend bits into a work area, attempt subtraction with the divisor; if subtraction succeeds record a 1 in quotient and keep remainder, otherwise record 0 and discard subtraction result.

Binary division works exactly the same way, as long as you use the
rules for binary digits instead of decimal digits.  For example:


10101
    _________
101 ) 1101101
     -101
     ----
        11
        -0
        --
        111
       -101
       ----
         100
          -0
         ---
         1001
         -101
         ----
          100


Note how much easier this is than the decimal version, mostly because
there are only two possible numbers to subtract:  0 or the divisor.
