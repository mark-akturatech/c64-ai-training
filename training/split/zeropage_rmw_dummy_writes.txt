# NMOS 6510 - Zeropage (R-M-W) instruction timing: lists ASL/DEC/INC/ISC/LSR/ROL/ROR/RRA etc on zero page and shows the per-cycle sequence (opcode fetch, PC+1, absolute low, read old data, dummy write of old data, final write of new data). Notes unmodified original is written back during dummy write.


ISC abs, x

Read/Write

1

PC

Opcode fetch

R

2

PC + 1

Absolute Address Low

R

3

PC + 2

Absolute Address High

R

4 (*1) < AAH, AAL + X >

Byte at target address before high byte was corrected R

5

AA + X

Old Data

R

6 (*2) AA + X

Old Data

W

7

New Data

W

AA + X

(*1) Dummy fetch from target address before the high byte was incremented
(*2) Unmodified data is written back to the target address
