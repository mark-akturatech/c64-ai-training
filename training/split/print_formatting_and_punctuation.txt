# COMMODORE 64 - How PRINT punctuation affects output: semicolon suppresses RETURN and no space; comma separates into columns (4 columns of 10 chars each on C64) and can suppress RETURN if last; quote marks delimit literal text; RETURN code moves to next logical line; logical lines may span screen lines and link via line link table.

    When working with one character set, individual lines can be PRINTed
  in the opposite character set. When in upper case with graphics, the
  cursor down character (CHR$(17)) switches the characters to the upper
  and lower case set. When in upper and lower case, the cursor up char-
  acter (CHR$(145)) allows upper case and graphics characters to be
  PRINTed.
    Other special functions in the printer are controlled through character
  codes. All these codes are simply PRINTed just like any other character.
