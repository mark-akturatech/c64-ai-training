# MACHINE - Detailed explanation of the EOR (exclusive OR) instruction applied to A, with a truth table showing how EOR masks flip bits when the mask bit is 1 and leave them unchanged when mask bit is 0. Example showing inversion of bits 4,5,6 of $C7 with EOR #$70 (01110000b) producing the resulting value.

EOR--Exclusive OR to A
----------------------

For each bit in the A register, EOR performs the following action:


Original A Bit    Mask     Resulting A Bit
------------------------------------------
      0            0             0
      1            0             1
      0            1             1
      1            1             0


Examine the upper half of this table.  When the mask is zero, the original
bit in A is left unchanged.  Examine the lower half.  When the mask is one,
the original bit is inverted; zero becomes one and one becomes zero.  Hence,
EOR can selectively flip bits over.

Example:  Invert bits 4, 5, and 6 in the following value:  $C7

  Original value:      11000111
  Mask:            EOR 01110000 (hex 70)
                   ------------
  Result:              10110111
                        ^^^

                                                                         :50:

Note that the bits marked have been flipped to the opposite value, while all
the other bits remain unchanged.
