# COMMODORE 64 - POKE <location>,<value>: writes a one-byte (0–255) value to a memory location or I/O register (location 0–65535). Usage for data storage, graphics, sound, loading assembly, and changing OS parameters. References mention full memory map in an appendix. Examples include POKE 1024,1 to display an 'A', updating sprite pointer with POKE 2040, and other generic examples.

  POKE

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: POKE <location>,<value>

  Action: The POKE statement is used to write a one-byte (8-bits) binary
  value into a given memory location or input/output register. The
  <location> is an arithmetic expression which must equal a value in the
  range of 0 to 65535. The <value> is an expression which can be reduced to
  an integer value of 0 to 255. If either value is out of its respective
  range, the BASIC error message ?ILLEGAL QUANTITY occurs.
    The POKE statement and PEEK statement (which is a built-in function
  that looks at a memory location) are useful for data storage, controlling
  graphics displays or sound generation, loading assembly language sub-
  routines, and passing arguments and results to and from assembly language
  subroutines. In addition, Operating System parameters can be examined
  using PEEK statements or changed and manipulated using POKE statements.
  A complete memory map of useful locations is given in Appendix G.
