# byRiclianll - Ask the user to confirm the new load address, then split the entered 4-character hex string into its high and low two-character halves. For each half (HD*), calls the hex->decimal subroutine (GOSUB 1060) to convert the two-character hex string into a numeric byte (assigning to LOW and HIGH). Checks a TME flag set by the converter to detect invalid hex digits and aborts if necessary.
