# MACHINE - Introduces the Commodore 'kernal' ROM routines: persistent system subroutines present on all Commodore machines; brief background on the term 'kernal' and that details are in the reference manuals.


Prewritten Subroutines
----------------------

A number of useful subroutines are permanently stored in the ROM memory of
the computer.  All Commodore machines have a standard set of subroutines that
may be called up by your programs.  They are always at the same addresses,
and perform in about the same way regardless of which Commodore machine is
used:  PET, CBM, Commodore 64, PLUS/4, or VIC-20.  These routines are called
the kernal subroutines.  Details on them can be found in the appropriate
Commodore reference manuals, but we'll give usage information here.

The original meaning of the term kernal seems to be lost in legend.  It was
originally an acronym, standing for something like "Keyboard Entry Read,
Network and Link."  Today, it's just the label we apply to the operating
system that makes screen, keyboard, other input/output and control mechanisms
work together.  To describe this central control system, we might choose to
correct the spelling so as to get the English word, "kernel."  For now, we'll
use Commodore's word.
