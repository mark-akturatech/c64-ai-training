# COMMODORE 64 - Indexing concept: creating an actual address by adding an index register (X or Y) to a base address (e.g., LDA $9000,X yields $9000 + X). Describes absolute indexed, zero page indexed, indirect indexed and indexed indirect variants and general mnemonic syntax with ,X or ,Y.

  INDEXING

    Indexing plays an extremely important part in the running of the 6510
  microprocessor. It can be defined as "creating an actual address from a
  base address plus the contents of either the X or Y index registers."
    For example, if X contains $05, and the microprocessor executes an LDA
  instruction in the "absolute X indexed mode" with base address (e.g.,
  $9000), then the actual location that is loaded into the A register is
  $9000 + $05 = $9005. The mnemonic format of an absolute indexed
  instruction is the same as an absolute instruction except a ",X" or ",Y"
  denoting the index is added to the address.

  EXAMPLE:

    LDA $9000,X

    There are absolute indexed, zero page indexed, indirect indexed, and
  indexed indirect modes of addressing available on the 6510
  microprocessor.
