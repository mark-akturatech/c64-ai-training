# MACHINE - 6520 Interrupt Request Lines (/IRQA, /IRQB): active low lines that interrupt the microprocessor. Each request line has two interrupt flag bits (bits 6 and 7 in CRA/CRB) that can cause the request line to go low; these flags can be masked/disabled by corresponding control bits to allow the CPU to enable/disable interrupts from each CA/CB input.

Interrupt Request Line (/IRQA, /IRQB)
-------------------------------------

The active low Interrupt Request lines (/IRQA and /IRQB) act to interrupt the
microprocessor either directly or through external interrupt priority
circuitry.

Each Interrupt Request line has two interrupt flag bits which can cause the
Interrupt Request line to go low.  These flags are bits 6 and 7 in the two
Control Registers.  These flags act as the link between the peripheral
interrupt signals and the microprocessor interrupt inputs.  Each flag has a
corresponding interrupt disable bit which allow the processor to enable or
disable the interrupt from each of the four interrupt inputs (CA1, CA2, CB1,
CB2).

The four interrupt flags are set by active transitions of the signal on the
interrupt input (CA1, CA2, CB1, CB2).  Controlling this active transition is
discussed in the next section.
