5. Conclusion

This was a quite short and not very in-depth rant. I hope, however, that it
shed light on some things about multidirectional scrolling and making a "game
world". These things are among the most complicated things in C64 games, only
3D worlds come to mind as more complex. I pretty much worship C64 games
containing such elements (provided that they're also playable otherwise) and
therefore I've dedicated most of my C64-related energy into making such
games myself.
