# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - General strategies to optimize 6502 code: reduce cycles per computation, consult opcode cycle tables, and use techniques like removing unnecessary instructions, substituting faster instruction sequences, loop unrolling, zero page usage and lookup tables.

How to Optimize Computations
So, how do you optimize computations written in 6502 machine code? There are lots of different ways, and I'm no expert, but I'll share some simple tricks, and hopefully you can use them and invent your own techniques for making your code run faster.

The basis of optimizing a computation is of course to decrease the time it takes, ie. decrease the number of machine cycles that each computation takes. Each instruction takes a few cycles to execute. You'll need a table with the timing for the different instructions.
