# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Sprite multiplexer principle: change Y coordinates (and optionally pointers) while sprite is being displayed so the sprite reappears lower on the screen, enabling reuse of hardware sprites. New Y must be at least $15 greater than previous to be visible. Pointer changes must be timed carefully to avoid mid-draw corruption.

Sprite Multiplexer
The principle of sprite multiplexers is very simple, but it can be a hassle to get a working implementation sometimes. What you do is that you change the Y coordinates of the sprites while they're being displayed, and as soon as the sprite is finished, it'll get the new Y coordinate, which is a couple of lines below. Note that the new Y coordinate has to be at least $15 greater than the previous value, or it won't be displayed at all the second time.

It gets even cooler if you change the sprite pointers too, but that has to be done at exactly the right time, because you can change the sprite data in the middle of a sprite's display, and then it'll just look weird, unless you really know what you're doing (it can be used for some advanced effects).

Use a sine table for the Y values, and find our where you have to change the coordinates.
