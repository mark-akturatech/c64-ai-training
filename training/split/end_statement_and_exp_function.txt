# COMMODORE 64 - END: terminates program execution and shows READY (vs STOP which shows BREAK IN LINE). Recommended to end programs with END. EXP(<number>): numeric function returning e^number where e = 2.71828183; values > 88.0296919 cause overflow. Examples for both END and EXP included.

  END

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: END

    Action: This finishes a program's execution and displays the READY
  message, returning control to the person operating the computer. There
  may be any number of END statements within a program. While it is not
  necessary to include any END statements at all, it is recommended that
  a program does conclude with one, rather than just running out of lines.
    The END statement is similar to the STOP statement. The only difference
  is that STOP causes the computer to display the message BREAK IN LINE XX
  and END just displays READY. Both statements allow the computer to resume
  execution by typing the CONT command.

  EXAMPLES of END Statement:

    10 PRINT"DO YOU REALLY WANT TO RUN THIS PROGRAM"
    20 INPUT A$
    30 IF A$ = "NO" THEN END
    40 REM REST OF PROGRAM . . .
    999 END
