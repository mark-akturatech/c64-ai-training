# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - KERNAL vector table ($0314 onward). Provides default vector addresses for many KERNAL services: IRQ ($0314), BRK ($0316), NMI ($0318), OPEN ($031A), CLOSE ($031C), CHKIN ($031E), CHKOUT ($0320), CLRCHN ($0322), CHRIN ($0324), CHROUT ($0326), STOP key scan ($0328), GETIN ($032A), CLRCHNALL ($032C), user function ($032E), LOAD ($0330), SAVE ($0332). Includes explanatory notes on $032E legacy behavior.

                                Vector to user defined command, currently points to BRK.
                                This appears to be a holdover from PET days, when the built-in machine language monitor
                                would jump through the $032E vector when it encountered a command that it did not
                                understand, allowing the user to add new commands to the monitor.
                                Although this vector is initialized to point to the routine called by STOP/RESTORE and
                                the BRK interrupt, and is updated by the kernal vector routine at $FD57, it no longer
                                has any function.
