# byRiclianll - Breakdown of the first four directory entries from the 1541TEST/DEMO disk (track 18, sector 01): shows raw bytes for each directory entry (entry 1..4), the decoded file type ($82 = PRG), start track/sector, filename, and file length in blocks. Entries include 'HOW TO USE', 'HOW PART TWO', 'VIC-20 WEDGE', 'C-64 WEDGE'.

To  be  sure  you  understand  the  file  entries  work  let's  break  out  the  first  sector  of  the 
test/demo  directory  to  show  each  file  entry.  Remember  that  bytes  0  and  1  of  each  entry 
are  unused  with  the  exception  of  the  first  entry.  Here  they  represent  a  forward  track 
and  sector  chain  and  have  nothing  to  do  with  that  file  in  particular.
