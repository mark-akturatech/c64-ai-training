# The MOS 6567/6569 video controller (VIC-II) and its application in the Commodore 64 - DEN (Display Enable) bit ($D011 bit 4) controls text/bitmap graphics on/off and affects Bad Lines and vertical border flip-flop reset input. DEN must have been set at least one cycle in raster line $30 for Bad Line Conditions to occur. Clearing DEN prevents Bad Lines and makes screen display border color only; it also disables vertical border flip-flop reset.

3.10. Display Enable
--------------------

The DEN bit (Display Enable, register $d011, bit 4) serves for switching on
and off the text/bitmap graphics. It is normally set. The bit affects two
functions of the VIC: The Bad Lines and the vertical border unit.

 - A Bad Line Condition can only occur if the DEN bit has been set for at
   least one cycle somewhere in raster line $30 (see section 3.5.).
 - If the DEN bit is cleared, the reset input of the vertical border flip
   flop is deactivated (see section 3.9.). Then the upper/lower border is
   not turned off.

So clearing the DEN bit will normally prevent Bad Lines (and thus c- and
g-accesses) from occuring and make the whole screen display the border
color.
