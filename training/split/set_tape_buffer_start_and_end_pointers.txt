# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Sets the I/O start pointer (C1/C2) and the tape buffer end pointer (AE/AF) based on the tape buffer start pointer and a fixed buffer length. Calls the get_tape_buffer_start_pointer helper (JSR $F7D0), copies X/A to C1, adds buffer-length low and high bytes to compute AE/AF, and saves the index Y to $9F.
