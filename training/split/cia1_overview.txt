# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $DC00-$DC0F — CIA #1 (6526) overview: addresses 56320-56335. CIA #1 handles joystick controllers, paddle fire buttons, keyboard matrix scanning, two timers, serial port, and interrupts. Timers used for keyboard scan (1/60s) and tape I/O timing; describes general CIA role.

$DC00-$DC0F               Complex Interface Adapter (CIA) #1 Registers

                          Locations 56320-56335 ($DC00-$DC0F) are used to communicate with the
                          Complex Interface Adapter chip #1 (CIA #1).  This chip is a successor
                          to the earlier VIA and PIA devices used on the VIC-20 and PET.  This
                          chip functions the same way as the VIA and PIA:  It allows the 6510
                          microprocessor to communicate with peripheral input and output
                          devices.  The specific devices that CIA #1 reads data from and sends
                          data to are the joystick controllers, the paddle fire buttons, and the
                          keyboard.

                          In addition to its two data ports, CIA #1 has two timers, each of
                          which can count an interval from a millionth of a second to a
                          fifteenth of a second.  Or the timers can be hooked together to count
                          much longer intervals.  CIA #1 has an interrupt line which is
                          connected to the 6510 IRQ line.  These two timers can be used to
                          generate interrupts at specified intervals (such as the 1/60 second
                          interrupt used for keyboard scanning, or the more complexly timed
                          interrupts that drive the tape read and write routines).  As you will
                          see below, the CIA chip has a host of other features to aid in
                          Input/Output functions.
