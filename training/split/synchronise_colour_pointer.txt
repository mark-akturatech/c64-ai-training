# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - Derives and writes the pointer to colour RAM based on the current screen line address in $D1/$D2. Copies low byte $D1 to $F3, masks and ORs the high byte $D2 with $D8 and stores it in $F4 so subsequent operations access the correct $D800 colour RAM area.

                                *** SYNCHRONISE COLOUR POINTER
                                The pointer to the colour RAM is set up according to the
                                current screen line address. This is done by reading the
                                current screen line address and modifying it to colour RAM
                                pointers and write it to USER at $f3/$f4
.,EA24 A5 D1    LDA $D1         copy screen line low byte
.,EA26 85 F3    STA $F3         to colour RAM low byte
.,EA28 A5 D2    LDA $D2         read'n modify the hi byte
