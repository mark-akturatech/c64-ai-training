# byRiclianll - Header and per-sector label rows for a padding hex dump used in the example. Contains the legend line (.  BO:  XX  XM  FF) followed by labeled rows for offsets BO, B8, CO, C8, DO, D8, EO, E8, FO, F8; each row shows three marker slots (values such as 00 or OO) that summarize how padding bytes are classified at those offsets.

.  BO:  XX  XM  FF 

.  B8:  00  00  OO 

.  CO:  00  00  00 

.  C8:  OO  OO  00 

.  DO:  00  OO  OO 

.  D8:  00  OO  OO 

.  EO:  00  OO  00 

.  E8:  OO  OO  00 

.  FO:  00  OO  00 

.  F8:  00  OO  OO
