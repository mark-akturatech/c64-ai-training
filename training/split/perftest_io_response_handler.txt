# ********* - I/O response display and failure handler (label at 1840): prints the prepared command/status text (cc$), performs INPUT#1,en,em$,et,es to read the drive's status bytes and error messages, prints a compact status line showing error code and messages, returns immediately if en<2 (success/OK range); on error prints 'unit is failing' and 'performance test', then saves ti$, calls the 'continue?' prompt routine (GOSUB 1750) to let the operator choose, restores ti$ and returns. Centralized handling for device replies used by format/open/write/read/track commands.
