# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $D015 (53269) SPENA — Sprite Display Enable Register: bits 0-7 enable sprites 0-7 respectively (1=on). To display a sprite, set this bit, make sure sprite data/pointer is non-zero, set color register, and set position within visible ranges.


$D015        SPENA        Sprite Enable Register

                     0    Enable Sprite 0 (1=sprite is on, 0=sprite is off)
                     1    Enable Sprite 1 (1=sprite is on, 0=sprite is off)
                     2    Enable Sprite 2 (1=sprite is on, 0=sprite is off)
                     3    Enable Sprite 3 (1=sprite is on, 0=sprite is off)
                     4    Enable Sprite 4 (1=sprite is on, 0=sprite is off)
                     5    Enable Sprite 5 (1=sprite is on, 0=sprite is off)
                     6    Enable Sprite 6 (1=sprite is on, 0=sprite is off)
                     7    Enable Sprite 7 (1=sprite is on, 0=sprite is off)

                          In order for any sprite to be displayed, the corresponding bit in this
                          register must be set to 1 (the default for this location is 0).  Of
                          course, just setting this bit along will not guarantee that a sprite
                          will be shown on the screen.  The Sprite Data Pointer must indicate a
                          data area that holds some values other than 0.  The Sprite Color
                          Register must also contain a value other than that of the background
                          color.  In addition, the Sprite Horizontal and Vertical Position
                          Registers must be set for positions that lie within the visible screen
                          range in order for a sprite to appear on screen.
