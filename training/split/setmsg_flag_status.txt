# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - SETMSG: Flag status (vectored from $ff90). Stores A into MSGFLG ($9D) and merges I/O STATUS ($90) into STATUS by ORA $90 and STA $90. Also supports entry point $FE1C where A stored in STATUS. Controls whether KERNAL prints messages.

                                *** SETMSG: FLAG STATUS
                                The KERNAL routine SETMSG ($ff90) jumps to this routine.
                                On entry, the value in (A) is stored in MSGFLG, then the
                                I/O status is placed in (A). If routine is entered at
                                $fe1c the contents in (A) will be stored in STATUS.
