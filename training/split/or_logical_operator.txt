# COMMODORE 64 - OR operator: performs bitwise OR when used in calculations (operands converted to 16-bit signed two's-complement) and acts as logical OR in comparisons (compound Boolean expression true if either operand true). Example showing bitwise OR on integers and explanation of resulting bit patterns.

  OR

  TYPE: Logical Operator
  FORMAT: <operand> OR <operand>


  Action: Just as the relational operators can be used to make decisions
  regarding program flow, logical operators can connect two or more re-
  lations and return a true or false value which can then be used in a
  decision. When used in calculations, the logical OR gives you a bit
  result of I if the corresponding bit of either or both operands is 1.
  This will produce an integer as a result depending on the values of the
  operands. When used in comparisons the logical OR operator is also used
  to link two expressions into a single compound expression. If either of
  the expressions are true, the combined expression value is true (-1). In
  the first example below if AA is equal to BB OR if XX is 20, the
  expression is true.
    Logical operators work by converting their operands to 16-bit, signed,
  two's complement integers in the range of -32768 to +32767. If the
  operands are not in the range an error message results. Each bit of the
  result is determined by the corresponding bits in the two operands.



  EXAMPLES of OR Operator:


    100 IF (AA=BB) OR (XX=20) THEN...

    230 KK%=64 OR 32: PRINT KK%         (You typed this with a bit
                                         value of 1000000 for 64
                                         and 100000 for 32)

    96                                  (The computer responded with
                                         bit value 1100000.
                                         1100000=96.)
