# Contents - Relative addressing used by branch instructions: operand is a signed one-byte offset from current instruction allowing branches in range -127 to +127 bytes. Assemblers compute offsets when using labels.

Relative Addressing 

All of the branching instructions in the 6510 use 
the relative addressing mode. In this mode, instead 
of specifying an address for the destination of the 
branch, an offset from the current instruction to the 
destination of the branch it specifies in the operand. 
The offset is a one byte value. This gives a branch 
instruction the ability to branch over a range of 
+ 127 bytes to — 127 bytes. Normally, you will use 
a label as the destination of the branch when writing 
your program, and the assembler will calculate the 
offset.
