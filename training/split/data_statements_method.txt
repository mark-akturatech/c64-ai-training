# COMMODORE 64 - Method: Enter machine code via BASIC DATA statements, READ into variables and POKE into memory. Easiest method but uses more memory and is slow to load, suitable for small routines. Example shows BASIC loop reading DATA and POKEing bytes into memory with a DATA line containing bytes.

  EXAMPLE:

  10 RESTORE:FORX=1T09:READA:POKE12*4096+X,A:NEXT
  .
  BASIC PROGRAM
  .
  1000 DATA 161,1,204,204,204,204,204,204,96
