# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - D016 Bit 3: cover up first and last columns with border enabling 40-column (1) or 38-column (0) text display; cosmetic aid for coarse scrolling (hides characters moved into view).

                          Bit 3.  Bit 3 of this register allows you to cover up the first and
                          last columns of the screen display with the border.  Since the viewers
                          cannot see the characters there, they will not be able to see you
                          insert a new character on the end of the line when you do coarse
                          scrolling (see explanation of Bits 0-2 above).

                          Setting this bit to 1 enables the normal 40-column display, while
                          resetting it to 0 changes the display to 38 columns.  This is a purely
                          cosmetic aid, and it is not necessary to change the screen to the
                          smaller size to use the scrolling feature.
