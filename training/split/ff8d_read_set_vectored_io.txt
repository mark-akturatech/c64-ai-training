# C64 KERNAL API (Lee Davison) - $FF8D — Read/Set vectored I/O. Manages system vector jump addresses stored in RAM. With carry=1 it stores current RAM vector contents into a user list pointed to by X/Y; with carry=0 it copies a user list from X/Y back into the system RAM vectors. Usage caution: read vectors, modify desired entries, then write back.

$FF8D          read/set vectored I/O
               
               This routine manages all system vector jump addresses stored in RAM. Calling this
               routine with the carry bit set will store the current contents of the RAM vectors
               in a list pointed to by the X and Y registers. When this routine is called with
               the carry bit clear, the user list pointed to by the X and Y registers is copied
               to the system RAM vectors.
               
               NOTE: This routine requires caution in its use. The best way to use it is to first
               read the entire vector contents into the user area, alter the desired vectors and
               then copy the contents back to the system vectors.
