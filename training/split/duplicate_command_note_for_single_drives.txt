# ********* - Section 4.8: DUPLICATE command description — legacy command for copying entire disks on dual-drive systems (4040); no function on single-drive 1541.



4.8 DUPLICATE

This command is a hangover from the operating systems that were
contained on the dual drives like the 4040. It was used to copy entire
diskettes from one drive to another, but has no function on a single
disk drive.
