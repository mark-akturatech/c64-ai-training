# byRiclianll - Explains the elements shown at the top of the directory and the structure of each directory entry: the leading drive number (a holdover from dual-drive systems), the diskette name (padded to 16 characters — padding defined), the two-character disk ID (cosmetic, often the original formatting ID), and the DOS version/format indicator (e.g., '2A', another legacy holdover). Also enumerates the three fields present in each directory entry: 1) number of blocks/sectors the file occupies, 2) the file name, and 3) the file type.

The  0  refers  to  which  drive  was  accessed.  This  is  a  holdover  from  the  4040  dual  drive 
system.  Next  you  see  the  diskette  name  —  1541TEST/DEMO.  In  the  event  that  the 
diskette  name  is  less  than  16  characters  in  length,  blank  spaces  are  appended  to  the 
end  of  the  name.  This  forced  spacing  is  known  as  padding.  Following  the  name  of  the 
diskette  is  the  disk  ID  —  ZX  in  this  instance.  These  two  characters  are  generally  (but 
not  always)  the  unique  alphanumeric  characters  under  which  the  diskette  in  question 
was  formatted  originally.  The  diskette  name  and  ID  are  cosmetic  in  nature  and  appear 
in  the  directory  for  your  reference  purposes  only.  The  2A  indicates  the  DOS  version 
and  format,  4040  in  this  instance  —  again  a  holdover.  Next  we  see  the  active  file  entries 
on  the  diskette  itself.  Each  directory  entry  has  three  fields: 

1.  The  number  of  blocks/sectors  the  given  file  occupies. 

2.  The  file  name. 

3.  The  file  type.
