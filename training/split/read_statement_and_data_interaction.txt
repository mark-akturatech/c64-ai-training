# COMMODORE 64 - READ <variables>: reads values from DATA statements into variables. Types must match or ?SYNTAX ERROR (reported at DATA line). READs traverse DATA list in order; exceeding DATA elements yields ?OUT OF DATA. If fewer variables specified than DATA elements, next READ resumes at following element. Example usages and relationship to RESTORE.

  READ

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: READ <variable>[,<variable>]...

    Action: The READ statement is used to fill variable names from con-
  stants in DATA statements. The data actually read must agree with the
  variable types specified or the BASIC error message ?SYNTAX ERROR will
  result.(*) Variables in the DATA input-list must be separated by commas.
    A single READ statement can access one or more DATA statements,
  which will be accessed in order (see DATA), or several READ statements
  can access the same DATA statement. If more READ statements are executed
  than the number of elements in DATA statements(s) in the program, the

  BASIC error message ?OUT OF DATA is printed. If the number of variables
  specified is fewer than the number of elements in the DATA statement(s),
  subsequent READ statements will continue reading at the next data
  element. (See RESTORE.)

  EXAMPLES of READ Statement:

    110 READ A,B,C$
    120 DATA 1,2,HELLO

    100 FOR X=1 TO 10: READ A(X):NEXT

    200 DATA 3.08, 5.19, 3.12, 3.98, 4.24
    210 DATA 5.08, 5.55, 4.00, 3.16, 3.37

    (Fills array items (line 1) in order of constants shown (line 5))

    1 READ CITY$,STATE$,ZIP
    5 DATA DENVER,COLORADO, 80211
