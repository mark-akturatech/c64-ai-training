# byRiclianll - Notes on record sizing and record #2: In the sequential portion of a relative file the record length is constant (150 bytes in this example). Record number 2 begins at byte 152 ($98) and extends into the next data block; two reads are required to fetch the entire record. The first 104 bytes are found in the current block; the remaining 46 bytes are in the next block (TRACK 17 - SECTOR 14).


In  the  sequential  data  file  portion  of  a  relative  file,  the  record  length  (record  size)  is 
constant.  In  this  case,  the  records  are  all  150  bytes  long.  Record  number  2  begins  at 
byte  152  ($98)  and  will  extend  on  into  the  next  data  block.  Two  reads  would  be  required 
to  fetch  the  entire  contents  of  this  record.  The  first  104  bytes  of  the  record  will  be  found 
here,  but  the  remaining  46  are  in  the  next  block  of  the  file.  Here  they  are.
