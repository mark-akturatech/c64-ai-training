# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Closing notes: encourages experimentation and combining basic effects; suggests there may still be undiscovered VIC tricks but less likely.

The Rest
The rest you'll have to figure our yourself, or read about in other places. Of course, as I've suggested above, variations of these basic effects can be made, and combining two or more of them can give very nice results. You have to be a bit creative to make interesting demos.

Of course, there might also be VIC tricks that haven't been discovered yet, although it's getting less and less likely.
