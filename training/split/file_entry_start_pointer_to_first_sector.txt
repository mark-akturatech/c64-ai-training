# byRiclianll - Explains bytes 2 and 3 in a directory file entry: a pointer (track, sector) to the first sector of that file on disk. Demonstrates how these two bytes are interpreted to find where the file's first block resides.

Enough  esoterica  for  now.  Let's  get  back  to  our  example: 

The  next  two  bytes  in  the  file  entry  are  a  pointer  to  where  the  first  sector  of  that  par- 
ticular file  is  stored  on  the  diskette.
