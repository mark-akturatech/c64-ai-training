# Kick Assembler - Explains that placing a label in front of a .for or .while loop creates a label-scope array so inner loop labels are accessible from outside or between loops. Example: .for (var i=0; i<20; i++) { lda #i sta loop2[i].color+1 } loop2: color: and another .for to clear colors.

understand everything in the following examples, but it helps to know where we are heading before going into
the details.
If you want to have one section of you code output to another file you can assemble it into a segment and write
that segment to a file like this:
.segment File1 [outPrg="MyFile.prg"]
*=$1000
lda #00
... more code ...
.segment Default

If you want to patch a file you can load the file into a Base segment, put a Patch segment on top of it with the
modifications and write the result to a file. Since the Patch is on top it will overwrite the base:
.file [name="Out.prg", segments="Base,Patch", allowOverlap]
.segment Base [prgFiles="basefile.prg"]
