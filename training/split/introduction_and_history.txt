# Architecture of 6502 Microprocessor - Overview of the MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor, its era (late 1970s) and notable systems that used it (Apple II, BBC Model B, Acorn Electron, Atari 800, Commodore 64, Vic 20, PET). Notes the simple instruction set and low cost.

The 6502 microprocessor was manufactured by MOS Technology in the late 1970’s, and was the main processor in a variety of early microcomputers, such as the Apple II, BBC Model B, Acorn Electron, Atari 800 and the Commodore 64, Vic 20 and PET models.

It had a relatively simple instruction set by modern standards, which made it cheap to produce.
