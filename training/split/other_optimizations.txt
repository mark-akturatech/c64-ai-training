# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Generic optimization advice: unroll loops, remove unnecessary instructions, use tables and zero page; always look for smarter data/layout changes to simplify computation.

Other Optimizations
The above techniques are just meant as examples of how to optimize code. The general idea should be pretty clear by now: do everything you can to make your code faster. Read through it and try to find ways to make it faster. Use tables, unroll loops, remove crap that's not necessary.
