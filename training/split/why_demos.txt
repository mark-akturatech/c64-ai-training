# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - Arguments for coding demos: fun, learning low-level programming, control of hardware, use of interrupts, and learning fundamentals such as pointers and efficient coding.

Why Demos?
It's pretty obvious why you'd want to program demos; because it's fun. You get all the usual advantages of doing programming, that you're learning about programming and that it's fun. You also get the added advantage that the resulting programs are cool and nice to look at (if you're good at it). And of course, demos is more fun than most other things you can program.

Another good thing about programming demos is that you'll learn about many different aspects of the computer, at a very low level. To get good performance (which is very important in demos), you need to write efficient code, and the only way to do that is to bang directly on the hardware (on the C-64, anyway). You don't use any kind of libraries or abstractions when you program demos, you do it all the hard way. So you need to understand how you make graphics appear on the screen, music to be heard from the speakers and how to load stuff from disk.

You also need to use interrupts, which is something you really need to know about if you're ever going to write an operating system. It is also one of the things that is considered to be difficult to understand. Don't let that scare you, though, it's a pretty easy principle to understand, and as soon as you've gotten it to work once, you can probably do it much more easily the next time.

All in all, in coding demos you learn how a computer works at a very fundamental level, and understanding that makes lots of other things in programming easier. I'll just take one example: novice C programmers often have lots of problems with pointers. Well, if you've written some machine code programs you know what pointers are and that they're not dangerous1.
