I/O Ports (PRA, PRB, DDRA, DDRB)
--------------------------------

Ports A and B each consist of an 8-bit Peripheral Data Register (PR) and an
8-bit Data Direction Register (DDR).  If a bit in the DDR is set to a one,
the corresponding bit in the PR is an output; if a DDR bit is set to a zero,
the corresponding PR bit is defined as an input.  On a READ, the PR reflects
the information present on the actual port pins (PA0-PA1, PB0-PB7) for both
input and output bits.  Port A and Port B have passive pull-up devices as
well as active pull-ups, providing both CMOS and TTL compatibility.  Both
ports have two TTL load drive capability.  In addition to normal I/O
operation, PB6 and PB7 also provide timer output functions.

                                                                        :271:

Handshaking
-----------

Handshaking on data transfers can be accomplished using the /PC output pin
and the /FLAG input pin.  /PC will go low for one cycle following a read or
write of Port B.  This signal can be used to indicate "data ready" at Port B
or "data accepted" from Port B.  Handshaking on 16-bit data transfers (using
both Port A and Port B) is possible by always reading or writing Port A
first.  /FLAG is a negative edge sensitive input which can be used for
receiving the /PC output from another 6526, or as a general purpose interrupt
input.  Any negative transition of /FLAG will set the /FLAG interrupt bit.

Interval Timers (Timer A, Timer B)
----------------------------------

Each interval timer consists of a 16-bit read-only Timer Counter and a 16-bit
write-only Timer Latch.  Data written to the timer are latched in the Timer
latch, while data read from the timer are the present contents of the Time
Counter.  The timers can be used independently or linked for extended
operations.  The various timer modes allow generation of long time delays,
variable width pulses, pulse trains and variable frequency waveforms.
Utilizing the CNT input, the timers can count external pulses or measure
frequency, pulse width and delay times of external signals.  Each timer has
an associated control register, providing independent control of the
following functions:


Start/Stop
----------

A control bit allows the time to be started or stopped by the microprocessor
at any time.


PB On/Off
---------

A control bit allows the timer output to appear on a Port B output line (PB6
for Timer A and PB7 for Timer B).  This function overrides the DDRB control
bit and forces the appropriate PB line to an output.


Toggle/Pulse
------------

A control bit selects the output applied to Port B.  On every timer underflow
the output can either toggle or generate a single positive pulse of one cycle
duration.  The Toggle output is set high whenever the timer is started and is
set low by /RES.

                                                                        :272:

One-Shot/Continuous
-------------------

A control bit selects either timer mode.  In one-shot mode, the timer will
count down from the latched value to zero, generate an interrupt, reload the
latched value, then stop.  In continuous mode, the timer will count from the
latched value to zero, generate an interrupt, reload the latched value and
repeat the procedure continuously.


Force Load
----------

A strobe bit allows the timer latch to be loaded into the timer counter at
any time, whether the timer is running or not.


Input Mode
----------

Control bits allow selection of the clock used to decrement the timer.  Timer
A can count phi2 clock pulses or external pulses applied to the CNT pin.
Timer B can count phi2 pulses, external CNT pulses, Timer A underflow pulses
or Timer A underflow pulses while the CNT pin is held high.

The timer latch is loaded into the timer on any timer underflow, on a force
load or following a write to the high byte of the prescaler while the timer
is stopped.  If the timer is running, a write to the high byte will load the
timer latch, but not reload the counter.

Time of Day Clock (TOD)
-----------------------

The TOD clock is a special purpose timer for real-time applications.  TOD
consists of a 24-hour (AM/PM) clock with 1/10th second resolution.  It is
organized into 4 register:  10ths of seconds, Seconds, Minutes and Hours.
The AM/PM flag is in the MSB of the Hours register for easy bit testing.
Each register reads out in BCD format to simplify conversion for driving
displays, etc.  The clock requires an external 60Hz or 50Hz (programmable)
TTL level input on the TOD pin for accurate timekeeping.  In addition to
time-keeping, a programmable Alarm is provided for generating an interrupt at
a desired time.  The Alarm registers are located at the same addresses as the
corresponding TOD registers.  Access to the Alarm is governed by a Control
Register Bit.  The Alarm is write-only; any read of a TOD address will read
time regardless of the state of the Alarm access bit.


A specific sequence of events must be followed for proper setting and reading
of TOD.  TOD is automatically stopped whenever a write to the Hours register
occurs.  The clock will not start again until after a write to the 10ths of
seconds register.  This assures TOD will always start at the desired time.
Since a carry from one stage to the next can occur at any time with respect
to a read operation, a latching function is included to keep all Time Of Day
information constant during a read sequence.  All four TOD registers latch on
a read of Hours and remain latched until after a read of 10ths of seconds.
The TOD clock continues to count when the output registers are latched.  If
only one register is to be read, there is no carry problem and the register
can be read "on the fly," provided that any read of Hours is followed by a
read of 10ths of seconds to disable the latching.

Serial Port (SDR)

The serial port is a buffered, 8-bit synchronous shift register system.  A
control bit selects input or output mode.  In input mode, data on the SP pin
is shifted into the shift register on the rising edge of the signal applied
to the CNT pin.  After 8 CNT pulses, the data in the shift register is dumped
into the Serial Data Register and an interrupt is generated.  In the output
mode, Timer A is used for the baud rate generator.  Data is shifted out on
the SP pin at 1/2 the underflow rate of Timer A.  The maximum baud rate
possible is phi2 divided by 4, but the maximum useable baud rate will be
determined by line loading and the speed at which the receiver responds to
input data.  Transmission will start following a write to the Serial Data
Register (provided Timer A is running and in continuous mode).  The clock
signal derived from Timer A appears as an output on the CNT pin.  The data in
the Serial Data Register will be loaded into the shift register then shifted
out to the SP pin when a CNT pulse occurs.  Data shifted out becomes valid on
the falling edge of CNT and remains valid until the next falling edge.  After
8 CNT pulses, an interrupt is generated to indicate more data can be sent.
If the Serial Data Register was loaded with new information prior to this
interrupt, the new data will automatically be loaded into the shift register
and transmission will continue.  If the microprocessor stays one byte ahead
of the shift register, transmission will be continuous.  If no further data
is to be transmitted, after the 8th CNT pulse, CNT will return high and SP
will remain at the level of the last data bit transmitted.  SDR data is
shifted out MSB first and serial input data should also appear in this
format.

The bi-directional capability of the Serial Port and CNT clock allows many
6526 devices to be connected to a common serial communication bus on which
one 6526 acts as a master, sourcing data and shift clock, while all other
6526 chips act as slaves.  Both CNT and SP outputs are open drain to allow
such a common bus.  Protocol for master/slave selection can be transmitted
over the serial bus, or via dedicated handshaking lines.

Interrupt Control (ICR)
-----------------------

There are five sources of interrupts on the 6526:  underflow from Timer A,
underflow from Timer B, TOD Alarm, Serial Port full/empty and /FLAG.  A
single register provides masking and interrupt information.  The Interrupt
Control Register consists of a write-only Mask register and a read-only Data
register.  Any interrupt which is enabled by the MASK register will set the
IR bit (MSB) of the Data register and bring the /IRQ pin low.  In a
multi-chip system, the IR bit can be polled to detect which chip has
generated an interrupt request.  The interrupt Data register is cleared and
the /IRQ line returns high following a read of the Data register.  Since each
interrupt sets an interrupt bit regardless of the MASK, and each interrupt
bit can be selectively masked to prevent the generation of a processor
interrupt, it is possible to intermix polled interrupts with true interrupts.
However, polling the IR bit will cause the Data register to clear, therefore,
it is up to the user to preserve the information contained in the Data
register if any polled interrupts were present.

The Mask register provides convenient control of individual mask bits.  When
writing to the Mask register, if bit 7 (SET, /CLEAR) of the data written is
a zero, any mask bit written with a one will be cleared, while those mask
bits written with a zero will be unaffected.  If bit 7 of the data written is
a one, any mask bit written with a one will be set, while those mask bits
written with a zero will be unaffected.  In order for an interrupt flag to
set IR and generate an Interrupt Request, the corresponding Mask bit must be
set.
