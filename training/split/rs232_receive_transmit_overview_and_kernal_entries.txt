# COMMODORE 64 - RS-232 receive/transmit behavior: receive buffer overflow behavior and advice to use machine language for high-speed data; BASIC syntax recommendations (GET# preferred, INPUT# not recommended); KERNAL entry points for RS-232 I/O: CHKIN ($FFC6), GETIN ($FFE4), CHRIN ($FFCF), CHKOUT ($FFC9), CHROUT ($FFD2), CLOSE ($FFC3). Notes about buffer sizes (receive buffer behavior, output buffer 255 chars) and system recovery (<RUN/STOP> + <RESTORE> warm start).


  KERNAL ENTRIES:

    CHKIN ($FFC6)-See Memory Map for more information on entry and exit
  conditions.
    GETIN ($FFE4)-See Memory Map for more information on entry and exit
  conditions.
    CHRIN ($FFCF)-See Memory Map for more information on entry and exit
  conditions.

  | NOTES:                                                                |
  |   If the word length is less than 8 bits, all unused bit(s) will be   |
  | assigned a value of zero.                                             |
  |   If a GET# does not find any data in the buffer, the character "" (a |
  | null) is returned.                                                    |
  |   If INPUT# is used, then the system will hang in a waiting condition |
  | until a non-null character and a following carriage return is         |
  | received. Therefore, if the Clear To Send (CTS) or Data Set Ready     |
  | (DSR) line(s) disappear during character INPUT#, the system will hang |
  | in a RESTORE-only state. This is why the INPUT# and CHRIN routines are|
  | NOT recommended.                                                      |
  |   The routine CHKIN handles the x-line handshake which follows the EIA|
  | standard (August 1979) for RS-232-C interfaces. (The Request To Send  |
  | (RTS), CTS, and Received line signal (DCD) lines are implemented with |
  | the Commodore 64 computer defined as the Data Terminal device.)       |

  SENDING DATA TO AN RS-232 CHANNEL

    When sending data, the output buffer can hold 255 characters before a
  full buffer hold-off occurs. The system will wait in the CHROUT routine
  until transmission is allowed or the <RUN/STOP> and <RESTORE> keys are
  used to recover the system through a WARM START.


  BASIC SYNTAX:

    CMD lfn-acts same as in the BASIC specifications.
    PRINT#lfn,<variable list>


  KERNAL ENTRIES:

    CHKOUT ($FFC9)-See Memory Map for more information on entry and exit
  conditions.
    CHROUT ($FFD2)-See Memory Map for more information on entry conditions.

  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | IMPORTANT NOTES: There is no carriage-return delay built into the     |
  | output channel. This means that a normal RS-232 printer cannot        |
  | correctly print, unless some form of hold-off (asking the Commodore 64|
  | to wait) or internal buffering is implemented by the printer. The     |
  | hold-off can easily be implemented in your program. If a CTS (x-line) |
  | handshake is implemented, the Commodore 64 buffer will fill, and then |
  | hold-off more output until transmission is allowed by the RS-232      |
  | device. X-line handshaking is a handshake routine that uses multi-    |
  | lines for receiving and transmitting data.                            |
  |   The routine CHKOUT handles the x-line handshake, which follows the  |
  | EIA standard (August 1979) for RS-232-C interfaces. The RTS, CTS, and |
  | DCD lines are implemented with the Commodore 64 defined as the Data   |
  | Terminal Device.                                                      |

  CLOSING AN RS-232 DATA CHANNEL

    Closing an RS-232 file discards all data in the buffers at the time of
  execution (whether or not it had been transmitted or printed out), stops
  all RS-232 transmitting and receiving, sets the RTS and transmitted data
  (Sout) lines high, and removes both RS-232 buffers.


  BASIC SYNTAX:

    CLOSE lfn


  KERNAL ENTRY:

    CLOSE ($FFC3)-See Memory Map for more information on entry and exit
  conditions.

  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | NOTE: Care should be taken to ensure all data is transmitted before   |
  | closing the channel. A way to check this from BASIC is:               |
  |                                                                       |
  | 100 SS=ST: IF(SS=0 OR SS=8) THEN 100                                  |
  | 110 CLOSE lfn                                                         |
