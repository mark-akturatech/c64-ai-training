# ********* - RNDX ($8B-$8F) seed value for the RND function (five-byte float seed explained), initial ROM seed bytes, behavior of RND(X) depending on sign of X: X=0 uses hardware timers seed; positive X returns next in pseudorandom sequence; negative X scrambles seed from X. Typical usage patterns for seeding (RND(-TI), RND(-RND(0))) and notes on pseudorandom determinism.

RND Function Seed Value

This location holds the five-byte floating point value returned by the
RND function.  It is initially set to a seed value copied from ROM
(the five bytes are 128, 79, 199, 82, 88--$80, $4F, $C7, $52, $58).

When the function RND(X) is called, the numeric value of X does not
affect the number returned, but its sign does.  If X is equal to 0,
RND generates a seed value from chip-level hardware timers.  If X is a
positive number, RND(X) will return the next number in an arithmetic
sequence.  This sequence continues for such a long time without
repeating itself, and gives such an even distribution of numbers, that
it can be considered random.  If X is negative, the seed value is
changed to a number that corresponds to a scrambled floating point
representation of the number X itself.

Given a particular seed value, the same pseudorandom series of numbers
will always be returned.  This can be handy for debugging purposes,
but not where you wish to have truly random numbers.

The traditional Commodore method of selecting a random seed is by
using the expression RND(-TI), mostly because RND(0) didn't function
correctly on early PETs.  While the RND(0) form doesn't really work
right on the 64 either (see location 57495 ($E097)), the expression
RND(-RND(0)) may produce a more random seed value.
