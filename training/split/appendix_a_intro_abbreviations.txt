# COMMODORE 64 - APPENDIX A title and introductory explanation of Commodore 64 BASIC keyword abbreviations: how abbreviations are formed (first one or two letters plus the shifted next letter), the special case of PRINT as '?', and the note that abbreviations used in program lines will LIST in full form.



  APPENDIX A

  ABBREVIATIONS FOR BASIC KEYWORDS

    As a time-saver when typing in programs and commands, Commodore 64
  BASIC allows the user to abbreviate most keywords. The abbreviation for
  PRINT is a question mark. The abbreviations for other words are made by
  typing the first one or two letters of the word, followed by the SHIFTed
  next letter of the word. If the abbreviations are used in a program line,
  the keyword will LIST in the full form.
