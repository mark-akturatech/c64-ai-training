# ********* - Section 4.2: NEW command to format a disk (creates timing/block markers, directory and BAM) or to clear directory of an already formatted disk; command syntax (PRINT#15,"NEW:name,id" or abbreviations) and the meaning of disk name and ID characters.

4.2 NEW

This command is necessary when using a diskette for the first time.
The NEW command erases the entire diskette, it puts timing and block
markers on the diskette and creates the directory and BAM.  The NEW
command can also be used to clear out the directory of an already-
formatted diskette.  This is faster than re-formatting the whole disk.

FORMAT FOR THE NEW COMMAND TO FORMAT DISK:

   PRINT#15, "NEW:name,id"

or abbreviated as

   PRINT#15, "N:name,id"

FORMAT FOR THE NEW COMMAND TO CLEAR DIRECTORY:

   PRINT#15, "N:name"

The name goes in the directory as the name of the entire disk.  This
only appears when the directory is listed.  The ID code is any 2
characters, and they are placed not only on the directory but on every
block throughout the diskette.  That way, if you carelessly replace
diskettes while writing data, the drive will know by checking the ID
that something is wrong.
