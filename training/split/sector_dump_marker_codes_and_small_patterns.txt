# byRiclianll - A block of the sector dump dominated by short marker-like tokens and small non-zero patterns. Contains alternating two-letter tokens such as 'OU', 'UU', 'UO', 'nn' and short runs of 00 bytes. Illustrates the interleaving of compact marker codes (possible metadata or DOS markers) with zero bytes in the dump's mid-region.
