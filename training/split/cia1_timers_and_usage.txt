# Analyzing C64 tape loaders - Details CIA #1 timers: Data ports, Timer A/B low/high byte registers ($DC04-$DC07), difference between read (counter) and write (latch) behavior. Explains timer count rate equals CPU cycles (≈1,022,730 NTSC or 985,250 PAL), TIME = LATCH/CLOCK_SPEED. Describes Timer A/B behavior at underflow: set bits in interrupt control register, optional port B output on bits 6/7, one-shot vs continuous modes, and linking timers to form a 32-bit timer.

CIA #1 Data Ports A and B

Data Port B can be used as an output by either Timer A or B. It is possible to set a mode in which the timers do not cause an interrupt when they run down (see the descriptions of Control Registers A and B at 56334-5 ($DC0E-F)). Instead, they cause the output on Bit 6 or 7 of Data Port B to change. Timer A can be set either to pulse the output of Bit 6 for one machine cycle, or to toggle that bit from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1. Timer B can use Bit 7 of this register for the same purpose.

These four timer registers (two for each timer) have different functions depending on whether you are reading from them or writing to them. When you read from these registers, you get the present value of the Timer Counter (which counts down from its initial value to 0). When you write data to these registers, it is stored in the Timer Latch, and from there it can be used to load the Timer Counter using the Force Load bit of Control Register A or B (see 56334-5 ($DC0E-F) below).

These interval timers can hold a 16-bit number from 0 to 65535, in normal 6510 low-byte, high-byte format (VALUE=LOW BYTE+256*HIGH BYTE). Once the Timer Counter is set to an initial value, and the timer is started, the timer will count down one number every microprocessor clock cycle. Since the clock speed of the 64 (using the American NTSC television standard) is 1,022,730 cycles per second, every count takes approximately a millionth of a second. The formula for calculating the amount of time it will take for the timer to count down from its latch value to 0 is:

TIME=LATCH VALUE/CLOCK SPEED

where LATCH VALUE is the value written to the low and high timer registers (LATCH VALUE=TIMER LOW+256*TIMER HIGH), and CLOCK SPEED is 1,022,370 cycles per second for American (NTSC) standard television monitors, or 985,250 for European (PAL) monitors.

When Timer Counter A or B gets to 0, it will set Bit 0 or 1 in the Interrupt Control Register at 56333 ($DC0D). If the timer interrupt has been enabled (see 56333 ($DC0D)), an IRQ will take place, and the high bit of the Interrupt Control Register will be set to 1. Alternately, if the Port B output bit is set, the timer will write data to Bit 6 or 7 of Port B. After the timer gets to 0, it will reload the Timer Latch Value, and either stop or count down again, depending on whether it is in one-shot or continuous mode (determined by Bit 3 of the Control Register).

Although usually a timer will be used to count the microprocessor cycles, Timer A can count either the microprocessor clock cycles or external pulses on the CTN line, which is connected to pin 4 of the User Port.

Timer B is even more versatile. In addition to these two sources, Timer B can count the number of times that Timer A goes to 0. By setting Timer A to count the microprocessor clock, and setting Timer B to count the number of times that Timer A zeros, you effectively link the two timers into one 32-bit timer that can count up to 70 minutes with accuracy within 1/15 second.

In the 64, CIA #1 Timer A is used to generate the interrupt which drives the routine for reading the keyboard and updating the software clock. Both Timers A and B are also used for the timing of the routines that read and write tape data. Normally, Timer A is set for continuous operation, and latched with a value of 149 in the low byte and 66 in the high byte, for a total Latch Value of 17045. This means that it is set to count to 0 every 17045/1022730 seconds, or approximately 1/60 second.

For tape reads and writes, the tape routines take over the IRQ vectors. Even though the tape write routines use the on-chip I/O port at location 1 for the actual data output to the cassette, reading and writing to the cassette uses both CIA #1 Timer A and Timer B for timing the I/O routines.
