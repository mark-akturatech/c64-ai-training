# ********* - CIA #2 Data Port Register A (56576 $DD00) and Data Port B (56577 $DD01) bit definitions: Bits 0-1 bank select, Bit2 RS-232 Sout (User Port pin M), Bit3 Serial Bus ATN, Bit4 Serial Bus clock out, Bit5 Serial Bus data out, Bit6 serial bus clock in, Bit7 serial bus data in. CI2PRB maps RS-232 SIN/RTS/DTR/RI/DCD/PB5/CTS/DSR and Timer outputs on Bits 6-7. Default Data Direction Register A = 63 (all outputs except bits 6-7), DDR B default = 0 (all inputs); RS-232 open changes Port B bits 1-2 to outputs.

PET at location 43 ($2B).

CIA #2 Data Direction Registers A and B

These Data Direction registers control the direction of data flow over
Data Ports A and B.  For more details on the operation of these
registers, see the entry for the CIA #1 Data Direction Registers at
56322 ($DC02).

The default setting for Data Direction Register A is 63 (all bits
except 6 and 7 are outputs), and for Data Direction Register B the
default setting is 0 (all inputs).  Bits 1 and 2 of Port B are changed
to output when the RS-232 device is opened.
