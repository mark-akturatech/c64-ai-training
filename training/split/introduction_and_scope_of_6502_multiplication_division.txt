# 6502 Multiplication and Division Algorithms - Source: llx.com - Overview of multiplying/dividing on the 6502; focus on clarity over speed; emphasizes unsigned integer routines with brief note about signed integers later; introduces that fractional/FP is out of scope.

Multiplying and Dividing on the 6502
============================================================


Introduction
----------------------------------------


One of the more common questions asked by new 6502 programmers
seems to be, "Hey...there's no multiply instruction!  How do I multiply
on the 6502?"  This article presents some answers to this question,
and as a bonus, answers to the companion question, "How do I divide on
the 6502?"


Of course the methods shown below are not the only ways to multiply
and divide, nor even the fastest.  They are, however, probably the
easiest ways to understand.


Most of the routines below are for unsigned integers, since these are
the easiest kinds of numbers to work with.  Extending them to signed
integers is discussed briefly near the end.  (The next logical step, numbers
with fractional parts, would require a whole new article.)
