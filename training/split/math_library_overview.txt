# Kick Assembler - Introduction to Kick Assembler's Math Library: states that it is built on Java's Math library (so nearly all Java math constants and functions are available) and notes that the only non-Java math function provided is mod (modulo).


4.8. The Math Library
Kick Assembler's math library is built upon the Java math library. This means that nearly every constant and
command in Java's math library is available in Kick Assembler. Here is a list of available constants and commands.
For further explanation consult the Java documentation at Suns homepage. The only non Java math library function
is mod (modulo).

Additional information can be found by searching:
- "math_constants" which expands on Lists the available math constants (PI, E) with values.
- "math_functions_basic" which expands on Begins the list of math functions (abs, acos, asin, atan, atan2, cbrt, ceil, cos, cosh, exp, expm1).
- "math_functions_extended" which expands on Continues the list of math functions (floor, hypot, IEEEremainder, log*, max/min, mod, pow).
