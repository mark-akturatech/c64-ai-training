# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - General introduction to interrupts: what an interrupt is, how the CPU temporarily stops the main program to run an interrupt routine and then returns to the main program.

                          This register is used to enable an IRQ request to occur when one of
                          the VIC-II chip interrupt conditions is met.  In order to understand
                          what that means, and how these interrupts can extend the range of
                          options available to a programmer, you must first understand what an
                          interrupt is.

                          An interrupt is a signal given to the microprocessor (the brains of
                          the computer) that tells it to stop executing its machine language
                          program (for example, BASIC), and to work on another program for a
                          short time, perhaps only a fraction of a second.  After finishing the
                          interrupt program, the computer goes back to executing the main
                          program, just as if there had never been a detour.
