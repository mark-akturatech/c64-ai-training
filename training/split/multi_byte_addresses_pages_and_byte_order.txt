# ********* - Describes how two bytes are used to represent larger numbers/addresses (256*256=65536 combinations), the concept of pages (256-byte units, page numbering starting at 0), and byte-ordering for two-byte addresses (LSB/LSB-first and MSB), with the typical computation: address = LSB + 256 * MSB. Notes which part is stored at the lower/higher memory location.

If all the bits are added together (128+64+32+16+4+2+1), they total
255, which is the maximum value of one byte.  What if you need to
count higher than 255?  Use two bytes.

By using a second bytere to count the number of 255's, 65536
combinations are possible (256*256).  This is the same number as the
bytes of memory in the Commodore 64.  Therefore, any byte can be
addressed by a number using a maximum of two bytes.

When discussing large, even units of memory, the second byte, the
number of 256's, is often used alone.  These units are known as pages.
Page 0 starts at location zero (0*256), Page 1 starts at location 256
(1*256), etc.

You may see thn terms low-byte, high-byte order or LSB (Least
Significant Byte), MSB (Most Significant Byte) order, mentioned later
in this book.  That refers to the way in which the Commodore 64
usually deals with a two-byte address.  The byte of the address that
represents the number of 256's (MSB) is usually stored higher in
memory than the part that stores the leftover value from 0 to 255
(LSB).  Therefore, to find the address, you must add the LSB to
256*MSB.
