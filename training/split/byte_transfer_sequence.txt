# Commodore IEC Serial Bus Protocol Reference - pagetable.com - IEC Layer 2: Basic byte transmission sequence. Sender controls CLK, receivers control DATA. Steps include sender releasing/controlling CLK, placing bits LSB-first on DATA, 60 µs minimum data-valid holds, receivers pulling DATA to acknowledge, repeated per bit and per byte.

================================================================================
PART 4: STANDARD SERIAL (IEC) BUS - LAYER 2: BYTE TRANSFER PROTOCOL
================================================================================

The sender controls CLK exclusively; receivers control DATA between bytes.

Basic Byte Transmission Sequence:
  1. Sender releases CLK to signal "ready to send"
  2. Receivers release DATA when ready to receive
  3. Sender pulls CLK (indicates data on DATA line is NOT yet valid)
  4. Sender places bit on DATA line (LSB first)
  5. Sender releases CLK (data valid) - held minimum 60 microseconds
  6. Sender pulls CLK again (data no longer valid) - held minimum 60 microseconds
  7. Steps 4-6 repeat for all 8 bits (LSB first)
  8. Receivers pull DATA to signal busy/acknowledge
  9. Sequence repeats for next byte or transmission ends
