# NMOS 6510 - Overview of seven 'unstable' undocumented opcodes: distinctions between opcodes that are truly unpredictable (magic-constant group) and those with predictable but unexpected results. Advises on preconditions to use them safely, and lists two main instability sources for the 'unstable address high byte' group (page-boundary/index crossing AND RDY/ DMA causing &{H+1} masking to drop off).
