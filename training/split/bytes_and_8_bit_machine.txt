# Contents - Extends the grouping concept to 8 bits: shows 2^8 = 256 possible values and that a group of 8 bits is called a byte. States the numeric range of a byte (0 to 255), notes that inside the Commodore 64 all data is represented and transferred as bytes, and explains why the C-64 is referred to as an '8-bit machine'.

If 8 bits were grouped together, the equation 
would be: 

2^N N=8 

2~8 

2.2*2*2*2*2*2*2 = 256 

So a group of 8 bits can have 256 different values. 
This grouping is referred to as a byte. Since is the 
first of the possible values of a byte, the range of 
values is from to 255. Inside the Commodore 64, 
all of the data is represented and transferred as 
bytes. This is what is meant when the C-64 is re- 
ferred to as an 8 bit machine. A byte is the standard 
unit of storage in the Commodore 64.
