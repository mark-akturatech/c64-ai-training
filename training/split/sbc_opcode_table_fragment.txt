# NMOS 6510 - Beginning of the SBC (USBC) instruction section. Contains the header for SBC including type note (combination of immediate and implied), listing of opcode bytes for SBC addr,Y ($f9) and SBC addr,X ($fd), and the associated function/size/cycle/flag columns (including N V - B D I Z and C). This fragment covers the opcode table lines for indexed absolute SBC variants and their size/cycle/flag layout.
