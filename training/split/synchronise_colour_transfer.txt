# - Commented Commodore 64 KERNAL Disassembly (Magnus Nyman) - Sets up a temporary pointer in EAL ($AE/$AF) to the colour RAM address that corresponds to the temporary screen address in EAL. Calls synchronise_colour_pointer and then prepares SAL/EAL to point to $D800-series colour RAM by ORing the high byte with $D8.

                                This routine sets up a temporary pointer in EAL to the

                                screen address held in EAL.

- "synchronise_colour_pointer" which expands on used to derive the colour RAM pointer from the current screen address
- "move_a_screen_line" which expands on called before moving characters so colour transfer is aligned
