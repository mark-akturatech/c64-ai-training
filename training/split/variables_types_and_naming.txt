# COMMODORE 64 - Variables: names representing data values; default creation behavior (auto-created as zero or null if referenced before assignment); only first two characters significant in CBM BASIC; rules forbidding keywords inside names; allowed characters (letters and digits), first character must be a letter; type suffixes: '%' for integer, '$' for string, none implies floating-point; examples.

  INTEGER, FLOATING-POINT AND STRING VARIABLES

    Variables are names that represent data values used in your BASIC
  statements. The value represented by a variable can be assigned by
  setting it equal to a constant, or it can be the result of calculations
  in the program. Variable data, like constants, can be integers, floating-
  point numbers, or strings. If you refer to a variable name in a program
  before a value has been assigned, the BASIC Interpreter will auto-
  matically create the variable with a value of zero if it's an integer or
  floating-point number. Or it will create a variable with a null value if
  you're using strings.
    Variable names can be any length but only the first two characters are
  considered significant in CBM BASIC. This means that all names used for
  variables must NOT have the same first two characters. Variable names may
  NOT be the same as BASIC keywords and they may NOT contain keywords in
  the middle of variable names. Keywords include all BASIC commands, state-
  ments, function names and logical operator names. If you accidentally use
  a keyword in the middle of a variable name, the BASIC error message
  ?SYNTAX ERROR will show up on your screen.
    The characters used to form variable names are the alphabet and the
  numbers 0-9. The first character of the name must be a letter. Data

  type declaration characters (%) and ($) can be used as the last char-
  acter of the name. The percent sign declares the variable to be an
  integer and the dollar sign ($) declares a string variable. If no type
  declaration character is used the Interpreter will assume that the vari-
  able is a floating-point. Some examples of variable names, value as-
  signments and data types are:

            A$="GROSS SALES"        (string variable)
            MTH$="JAN"+A$           (string variable)
            K%=5                    (integer variable)
            CNT%=CNT%+1             (integer variable)
            FP=12.5                 (floating-point variable)
            SUM=FP*CNT%             (floating-point variable)
