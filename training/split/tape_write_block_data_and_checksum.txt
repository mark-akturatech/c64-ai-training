# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Handles sending actual block data after sync bytes are done and deals with the checksum. Calls a pointer-check routine (JSR $FCD1) to decide whether the buffer pointer has reached the end. If pointer indicates block-complete, prepares the checksum byte to be written (INC $AD to force subsequent block-complete branch, LDA $D7 STA $BD) and exits. If block not complete, fetches the next byte from the buffer (LDY #$00; LDA ($AC),Y), stores it as the next tape write byte ($BD), XORs it into the checksum ($D7), calls the pointer-increment routine (JSR $FCDB) and returns.

                                the synchronization bytes have been done so now check and do the actual block data
.,FC30 20 D1 FC JSR $FCD1       check read/write pointer, return Cb = 1 if pointer >= end
.,FC33 90 0A    BCC $FC3F       if not all done yet go get the byte to send
.,FC35 D0 91    BNE $FBC8       if pointer > end go flag block done and exit interrupt
                                else the block is complete, it only remains to write the
                                checksum byte to the tape so setup for that
.,FC37 E6 AD    INC $AD         increment buffer pointer high byte, this means the block
                                done branch will always be taken next time without having
                                to worry about the low byte wrapping to zero
.,FC39 A5 D7    LDA $D7         get checksum byte
.,FC3B 85 BD    STA $BD         save checksum as tape write byte
.,FC3D B0 CA    BCS $FC09       restore registers and exit interrupt, branch always
                                the block isn't finished so get the next byte to write to tape
.,FC3F A0 00    LDY #$00        clear index
.,FC41 B1 AC    LDA ($AC),Y     get byte from buffer
.,FC43 85 BD    STA $BD         save as tape write byte
.,FC45 45 D7    EOR $D7         XOR with checksum byte
.,FC47 85 D7    STA $D7         save new checksum byte
.,FC49 20 DB FC JSR $FCDB       increment read/write pointer
.,FC4C D0 BB    BNE $FC09       restore registers and exit interrupt, branch always

Additional information can be found by searching:
- "tape_write_shift_count_and_new_byte_setup" which expands on continuation: when sync bytes are finished this chunk reads and processes block data
- "tape_write_parity_send" which expands on if all data bits of a byte are done, control may transfer to parity-bit sending handled in that chunk
