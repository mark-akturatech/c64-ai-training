# ca65 Users Guide - The -g, --debug-info option (or .DEBUGINFO): causes the assembler to add a section to the object file containing all symbols (including locals) with values and source positions; the linker can export these into a VICE label file.


-g, --debug-info
When this option (or the equivalent control command .DEBUGINFO) is used, the assembler will add a section to the object file that contains all symbols (including local ones) together with the symbol values and source file positions. The linker will put these additional symbols into the VICE label file, so even local symbols can be seen in the VICE monitor.
