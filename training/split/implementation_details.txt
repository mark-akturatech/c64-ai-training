# A 256 Byte Autostart Fast Loader for the Commodore 64 - Single-sector layout: combines C64 code in the first half and 1541 drive code in the second half. The 1541 default buffer at $0400 still contains the sector, allowing the C64 to send an "M-E" (memory-execute) command pointing to the drive code's address within that buffer.



Implementation Details
----------------------

The program combines both C64 and drive code in a single sector by storing
C64 code in the first half and drive code in the second half. The 1541's
default buffer at $0400 still contains the loaded sector, enabling the C64
to send a "M-E" (memory-execute) command pointing to the drive code's
address within that buffer.
