# 6502 Microprocessor - Indirect addressing: only used by JMP (JMP (addr)). The two bytes at the supplied address form the jump destination (low byte at the low address). Example: JMP ($215F) reads $215F and $2160 to form destination $3076.

  8) Indirect
  This mode applies only to the JMP instruction - JuMP to new location. It is
  indicated by parenthesis around the operand. The operand is the address of
  the bytes whose value is the new location.
  eg.  JMP ($215F)
  Assume the following -        byte      value
                                $215F     $76
                                $2160     $30
  This instruction takes the value of bytes $215F, $2160 and uses that as the
  address to jump to - i.e. $3076 (remember that addresses are stored with
  low byte first).
