# COMMODORE 64 - Explains how to re-run the first music example to hear different waveforms, identifies the first program as using the 6581 SID sawtooth waveform (with ASCII illustration), and instructs changing the note start/stop numbers (line 70 and line 90) so the program will be modified — concludes with the 'Your program should now look like this:' lead-in and the Example Program 3 title.

    To make what we're talking about a bit more practical, let's go back to
  the first example program to investigate different waveforms. The reason
  for this is that you can hear the changes more easily using only one
  voice. LOAD the first music program that you typed in earlier, from your
  DATASSETTE(TM) or disk, and RUN it again. That program is using the
  sawtooth waveform (shown here)

                            / |     / |     / |
                           /  |    /  |    /  |
                         ./...|.../...|.../...|.....
                              |  /    |  /    |  /
                              | /     | /     | /
                              |/      |/      |/

  from the 6581 SID chip's sound generating device. Try changing the note
  start number in line 70 from 33 to 17 and the note stop number in line 90
  from 32 to 16. Your program should now look like this:
