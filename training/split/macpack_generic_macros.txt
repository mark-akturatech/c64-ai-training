# ca65 Users Guide - .MACPACK generic: predefined macros useful in many programs. Defines compact macros: add Arg (CLC / ADC Arg), sub Arg (SEC / SBC Arg), bge Arg (BSC Arg), blt Arg (BCC Arg), bgt Arg (implements greater-than using local label L), ble Arg (BEQ / BCC), bnz Arg (BNE), bze Arg (BEQ). Illustrates use of .LOCAL inside macro definitions.


13. Macro packages
Using the .MACPACK directive, predefined macro packages may be included with just one command. Available macro packages are:

13.1 .MACPACK generic
This macro package defines macros that are useful in almost any program. Currently defined macros are:


        .macro  add     Arg     ; add without carry
                clc
                adc     Arg
        .endmacro

        .macro  sub     Arg     ; subtract without borrow
                sec
                sbc     Arg
        .endmacro

        .macro  bge     Arg     ; branch on greater-than or equal
                bcs     Arg
        .endmacro

        .macro  blt     Arg     ; branch on less-than
                bcc     Arg
        .endmacro

        .macro  bgt     Arg     ; branch on greater-than
                .local  L
                beq     L
                bcs     Arg
        L:
        .endmacro

        .macro  ble     Arg     ; branch on less-than or equal
                beq     Arg
                bcc     Arg
        .endmacro

        .macro  bnz     Arg     ; branch on not zero
                bne     Arg
        .endmacro

        .macro  bze     Arg     ; branch on zero
                beq     Arg
        .endmacro
