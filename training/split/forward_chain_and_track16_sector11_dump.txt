# byRiclianll - Continuation of the forward-chain traversal: shows the forward-link block (.00: line with the link bytes) and then follows that link to track 16, sector 11. Contains the header 'TRACK 16 - SECTOR 11' and the initial byte/ASCII dump lines for that block (.00:, .08:, .10: lines) and a short remark that nothing of particular interest appears in this block.

Let's  follow  the  forward  chain  to  track  16,  sector  11  and  take  a  look  at  the  start  of  the 
second  block  in  our  file.
