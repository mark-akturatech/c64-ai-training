# COMMODORE 64 - Method 1: BASIC SYS X — causes a jump to machine language subroutine at address X. Routine must end with RTS to return to BASIC. Parameter passing typically via PEEK/POKE. SYS is most straightforward for combining BASIC and machine language.

    1) The BASIC statement SYS X causes a JUMP to a machine language
       subroutine located at address X. The routine must end with an RTS
       (ReTurn from Subroutine) instruction. This will transfer control
       back to BASIC.
         Parameters are generally passed between the machine language
       routine and the BASIC program using the BASIC PEEK and POKE
       statements, and their machine language equivalents.
         The SYS command is the most useful method of combining BASIC with
       machine language. PEEKs and POKEs make multiple parameter passing
       easy. There can be many SYS statements in a program, each to a
       different (or even the same) machine language routine.
