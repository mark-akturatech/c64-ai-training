# C64 KERNAL API (Lee Davison) - $FFD5 — Load RAM from a device. Loads bytes from input device directly into RAM or performs a verify operation. A=0 for load, A=1 for verify. If device was OPENed with secondary address 0 header info from device ignored and XY must contain load start address. If secondary address 1 or 2, header determines load address. Returns highest RAM address loaded. Requires SETLFS and SETNAM beforehand.

$FFD5          load RAM from a device
               
               This routine will load data bytes from any input device directly into the memory
               of the computer. It can also be used for a verify operation comparing data from a
               device with the data already in memory, leaving the data stored in RAM unchanged.
               
               The accumulator must be set to 0 for a load operation or 1 for a verify. If the
               input device was OPENed with a secondary address of 0 the header information from
               device will be ignored. In this case XY must contain the starting address for the
               load. If the device was addressed with a secondary address of 1 or 2 the data will
               load into memory starting at the location specified by the header. This routine
               returns the address of the highest RAM location which was loaded.
               
               Before this routine can be called, the SETLFS, $FFBA, and SETNAM, $FFBD,
               routines must be called.
