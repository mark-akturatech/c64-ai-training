# 6502 ADDRESSING MODES - SUMMARY: Relative addressing recap for branches: operand is a two's complement offset (-128 to +127) added to the address after the branch to produce the target. Example: 4545 BEQ $13 will branch to $4547 + $13 = $455A if zero flag is set. Example following LDA at $4547.





Relative addressing
This is used in conjunction with branches.  The operand is a 2’s comp number (-128 - +127) which is added to the address of the instruction following the branch instruction to give the address of the instruction to be jumped to.
4545	BEQ	$13		This BEQ command will cause control to be passed to the instruction in location $4547 + $13 = $455A, provided that the zero flag is set.
4547	LDA	$9333
