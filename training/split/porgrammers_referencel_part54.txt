  B-18. Function Name: OPEN


    Purpose: Open a logical file
    Call address: $FFC0 (hex) 65472 (decimal)
    Communication registers: None
    Preparatory routines: SETLFS, SETNAM
    Error returns: 1,2,4,5,6,240, READST
    Stack requirements: None
    Registers affected: A, X, Y

    Description: This routine is used to OPEN a logical file. Once the
  logical file is set up, it can be used for input/output operations. Most
  of the I/O KERNAL routines call on this routine to create the logical
  files to operate on. No arguments need to be set up to use this routine,
  but both the SETLFS and SETNAM KERNAL routines must be called before
  using this routine.


  How to Use:

    0) Use the SETLFS routine.
    1) Use the SETNAM routine.
    2) Call this routine.

  EXAMPLE:

    This is an implementation of the BASIC statement: OPEN 15,8,15,"I/O"


          LDA #NAME2-NAME    ;LENGTH OF FILE NAME FOR SETLFS
          LDY #>NAME         ;ADDRESS OF FILE NAME
          LDX #<NAME
          JSR SETNAM
          LDA #15
          LDX #8
          LDY #15
          JSR SETLFS
          JSR OPEN
    NAME  .BYT 'I/O'
    NAME2

  B-19. Function Name: PLOT

    Purpose: Set cursor location
    Call address: $FFF0 (hex) 65520 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A, X, Y
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns: None
    Stack requirements: 2
    Registers affected: A, X, Y

    Description: A call to this routine with the accumulator carry flag
  set loads the current position of the cursor on the screen (in X,Y
  coordinates) into the Y and X registers. Y is the column number of the
  cursor location (6-39), and X is the row number of the location of the
  cursor (0-24). A call with the carry bit clear moves the cursor to X,Y
  as determined by the Y and X registers.

  How to Use:


  READING CURSOR LOCATION

    1) Set the carry flag.
    2) Call this routine.
    3) Get the X and Y position from the Y and X registers, respectively.


  SETTING CURSOR LOCATION

    1) Clear carry flag.
    2) Set the Y and X registers to the desired cursor location.
    3) Call this routine.


  EXAMPLE:

    ;MOVE THE CURSOR TO ROW 10, COLUMN 5 (5,10)
    LDX #10
    LDY #5
    CLC
    JSR PLOT

  B.20. Function Name: RAMTAS

    Purpose: Perform RAM test
    Call address: $FF87 (hex) 65415 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A, X, Y
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns: None
    Stack requirements: 2
    Registers affected: A, X, Y

    Description: This routine is used to test RAM and set the top and
  bottom of memory pointers accordingly. It also clears locations $0000 to
  $0101 and $0200 to $03FF. It also allocates the cassette buffer, and sets
  the screen base to $0400. Normally, this routine is called as part of the
  initialization process of a Commodore 64 program cartridge.

  EXAMPLE:
    JSR RAMTAS

  B-21. Function Name: RDTIM

    Purpose: Read system clock
    Call address: $FFDE (hex) 65502 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A, X, Y
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns: None
    Stack requirements: 2
    Registers affected: A, X, Y

    Description: This routine is used to read the system clock. The clock's
  resolution is a 60th of a second. Three bytes are returned by the
  routine. The accumulator contains the most significant byte, the X index
  register contains the next most significant byte, and the Y index
  register contains the least significant byte.

  EXAMPLE:

    JSR RDTIM
    STY TIME
    STX TIME+1
    STA TIME+2
    ...
    TIME *=*+3

  B-22. Function Name: READST

    Purpose: Read status word
    Call address: $FFB7 (hex) 65463 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns: None
    Stack requirements: 2
    Registers affected: A

    Description: This routine returns the current status of the I/O devices
  in the accumulator. The routine is usually called after new communication
  to an I/O device. The routine gives you information about device status,
  or errors that have occurred during the I/O operation.
    The bits returned in the accumulator contain the following information:
  (see table below)

  How to Use:

    1) Call this routine.
    2) Decode the information in the A register as it refers to your pro-
       gram.

  EXAMPLE:

    ;CHECK FOR END OF FILE DURING READ
    JSR READST
    AND #64                       ;CHECK EOF BIT (EOF=END OF FILE)
    BNE EOF                       ;BRANCH ON EOF

  B-23. Function Name: RESTOR

    Purpose: Restore default system and interrupt vectors
    Call address: $FF8A (hex) 65418 (decimal)
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns: None
    Stack requirements: 2
    Registers affected: A, X, Y

    Description: This routine restores the default values of all system
  vectors used in KERNAL and BASIC routines and interrupts. (See the Memory
  Map for the default vector contents). The KERNAL VECTOR routine is used
  to read and alter individual system vectors.

  How to Use:
    1) Call this routine.

  EXAMPLE:
    JSR RESTOR

  B-24. Function Name: SAVE

    Purpose: Save memory to a device
    Call address: $FFD8 (hex) 65496 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A, X, Y
    Preparatory routines: SETLFS, SETNAM
    Error returns: 5,8,9, READST
    Stack requirements: None
    Registers affected: A, X, Y

                                            BASIC TO MACHINE LANGUAGE   293

    Description: This routine saves a section of memory. Memory is saved
  from an indirect address on page 0 specified by the accumulator to the
  address stored in the X and Y registers. It is then sent to a logical
  file on an input/output device. The SETLFS and SETNAM routines must be
  used before calling this routine. However, a file name is not required to
  SAVE to device 1 (the Datassette(TM) recorder). Any attempt to save to
  other devices without using a file name results in an error.

  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | NOTE: Device 0 (the keyboard), device 2 (RS-232), and device 3 (the   |
  | screen) cannot be SAVEd to. If the attempt is made, an error occurs,  |
  | and the SAVE is stopped.                                              |
  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

  How to Use:

    0) Use the SETLFS routine and the SETNAM routine (unless a SAVE with no
       file name is desired on "a save to the tape recorder"),
    1) Load two consecutive locations on page 0 with a pointer to the start
       of your save (in standard 6502 low byte first, high byte next
       format).
    2) Load the accumulator with the single byte page zero offset to the
       pointer.
    3) Load the X and Y registers with the low byte and high byte re-
       spectively of the location of the end of the save.
    4) Call this routine.

  EXAMPLE:

    LDA #1              ;DEVICE = 1:CASSETTE
    JSR SETLFS
    LDA #0              ;NO FILE NAME
    JSR SETNAM
    LDA PROG            ;LOAD START ADDRESS OF SAVE
    STA TXTTAB          ;(LOW BYTE)
    LDA PROG+1
    STA TXTTA B+1       ;(HIGH BYTE)
    LDX VARTAB          ;LOAD X WITH LOW BYTE OF END OF SAVE
    LDY VARTAB+1        ;LOAD Y WITH HIGH BYTE
    LDA #<TXTTAB        ;LOAD ACCUMULATOR WITH PAGE 0 OFFSET
    JSR SAVE
