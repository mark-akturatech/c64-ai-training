# COMMODORE 64 - Summarizes visible ranges: Unexpanded sprites visible in 40x25 mode for 24 < X < 343 and 30 < Y < 249. In 38-column mode X range becomes 8 <= X <= 334. In 24-row mode Y range becomes 34 <= Y <= 245. For expanded sprites, different ranges listed (e.g., 9 <= Y <= 249). Provides numeric constraints to help ensure sprites are visible.

  The charts in Figure 3-3 explain sprite positioning.
    By using these values, you can position each sprite anywhere. By moving
  the sprite a single dot position at a time, very smooth movement is easy
  to achieve.


  SPRITE POSITIONING SUMMARY

    Unexpanded sprites are at least partially visible in the 40 column, by
  25 row mode within the following parameters:

                            1 < X < 343

                           30 < Y < 249

  In the 38 column mode, the X parameters change to she following:

                           8 <= X <= 334

  In the 24 row mode, the Y parameters change to the following:

                          34 <= Y <= 245

    Expanded sprites are at least partially visible in the 40 column, by 25
  row mode within the following parameters:

                         489 >= X <= 343
                           9 >= Y <= 249

  In the 38 column mode, the X parameters change to the following:

                         496 >= X <= 334

  In the 24 row mode, the Y parameters change to the following:

                          13 <= Y <= 245
