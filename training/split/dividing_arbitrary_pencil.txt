# 6502 Multiplication and Division Algorithms - Source: llx.com - Long division (pencil-and-paper) analogy and algorithm: find the largest multiple of divisor less than the current leftmost portion of dividend, subtract, bring down next digit, repeat. Illustrated with decimal example (12345 / 67 -> quotient 184 remainder 17). Introduces binary division as the same process with binary digits.

Dividing Arbitrary Numbers
----------------------------------------


As with multiplication, a reasonable division algorithm can be found
by looking at the way you would write out a long division with pencil
and paper.  Consider the following example, written in the manner
traditionally taught in U.S. schools:


184
_______
67 ) 12345
     -67
     ---
      564
     -536
     ----
       285
      -268
      ----
        17


Here we divided a dividend, 12345, by a divisor, 67,
and got quotient of 184, with a remainder of 17.  Note the
procedure...at each step, we find the largest multiple of the divisor
that is less than the leftmost remaining digits of the dividend, and
subtract.  Then we bring down the next digit of the dividend, and repeat
until no more digits are left.
