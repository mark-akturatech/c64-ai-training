# The MOS 6567/6569 video controller (VIC-II) and its application in the Commodore 64 - ECM=0, BMM=0, MCM=0 standard text mode. c-access address layout: VM13-VM10 + VC bits (VC0-VC9) selects 12-bit matrix address; c-data layout: bits 0-7 character pointer, bits 8-11 color nybble (upper 4 = color for '1' pixels). g-access address: CB13..CB11 + character byte D7..D0 + RC2..RC0 selects character row within char generator; g-data: 8 pixels (1 bit/pixel) where 0=background color0 ($D021), 1=color from bits 8-11 of c-data.

3.7.3.1. Standard text mode (ECM/BMM/MCM=0/0/0)
-----------------------------------------------

In this mode (as in all text modes), the VIC reads 8 bit character pointers
from the video matrix that specify the address of the dot matrix of the
character in the character generator. A character set of 256 characters is
available, each consisting of 8�8 pixels which are stored in 8 successive
bytes in the character generator. Video matrix and character generator can
be moved in memory with the bits VM10-VM13 and CB11-CB13 of register $d018.

In standard text mode, every bit in the character generator directly
corresponds to one pixel on the screen. The foreground color is given by
the color nybble from the video matrix for each character, the background
color is set globally with register $d021.
