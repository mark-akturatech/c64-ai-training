# MACHINE - Shows the code to install the wedge via $0308 vector: save old vector into $03A0/$03A1, then store new vector address $033C into $0308/$0309, and return (RTS). Instructs to invoke the installer with SYS 862. Explains that BASIC will now accept '&' as the special command.

The above code prints an asterisk ($2A) ten times and then prints a RETURN
($0D).  It then goes to the regular BASIC interpreter, which will look behind
the ampersand character for a new BASIC command.

Now we need to set up the link to our program.  We'll write the code to do
this starting at $035E, so that SYS 862 will put the new command (ampersand)
into effect:

  .A 035E  LDA $0308
  .A 0361  STA $03A0
  .A 0364  LDA $0309
  .A 0367  STA $03A1
  .A 036A  LDA #$3C
  .A 036C  STA $0308
  .A 036F  LDA #$03
  .A 0371  STA $0309
  .A 0374  RTS
