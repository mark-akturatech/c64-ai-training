# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - Intro to Sprite Collision Detection Registers ($D01E-$D01F): VIC IRQ bits indicate collisions (sprite-sprite, sprite-foreground). These registers specify which sprites were involved. Reading them clears the detection latches; rules explain that collision firing depends on nonzero shape bits and that some bit-pairs (01 in multicolor) are considered background and do not count.

$D01E-$D01F               Sprite Collision Detection Registers

                          While Bit 2 of the VIC IRQ Register at 53273 ($D019) is set to 1
                          anytime two sprites overlap, and Bit 1 is set to 1, when a sprite
                          shape is touching the foreground text or bit-graphics display, these
                          registers specify which sprites were involved in the collision.  Every
                          bit that is set to 1 indicates that the corresponding sprite was
                          involved in the collision.  Reading these registers clears them so
                          that they can detect the next collision.  Therefore, if you plan to
                          make multiple tests on the values stored here, it may be necessary to
                          copy it to a RAM variable for further reference.
