# byRiclianll - Sets drive/IEC hardware registers and runs the write-sync loop. Loads and stores values to drive registers (*1C03, *1C0C, *1C01), manipulates bits with AND/ORA to set required drive control lines, and executes a WRITESYNC loop (BVC/CLV/DEX/BNE) to synchronize with the drive's write window. After sync is achieved it loads Y with the overflow-area start (LDY «*BB) to prepare for writing the first chunk of GCR data from the overflow buffer.
