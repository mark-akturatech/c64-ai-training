# C64 KERNAL API (Lee Davison) - $FFEA — Increment real-time clock. Updates system clock by one jiffy. Normally called by KERNAL interrupt routine every 1/60 s; if user program handles interrupts itself this must be called to maintain clock and STOP-key functionality.

$FFEA          increment real time clock
               
               This routine updates the system clock. Normally this routine is called by the
               normal KERNAL interrupt routine every 1/60th of a second. If the user program
               processes its own interrupts this routine must be called to update the time. Also,
               the STOP key routine must be called if the stop key is to remain functional.
