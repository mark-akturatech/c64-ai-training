# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - CIA #2 Time of Day Clock registers ($DD08-$DD0B): same format as CIA #1 TOD — $DD08 TO2TEN (tenths BCD low nibble), $DD09 TO2SEC (seconds BCD), $DD0A TO2MIN (minutes BCD), $DD0B TO2HRS (hours BCD with AM/PM flag in bit 7). The C64 OS does not use these CIA #2 TOD registers.

$DD08-$DD0B               Time of Day Clock

                          In addition to the two general purpose timers, the 6526 CIA chip has a
                          special purpose Time of Day Clock, which keeps time in a format that
                          humans can understand a little more easily than microseconds.  For
                          more information about this clock, see the entry for Location Range
                          56328-56331 ($DC08-$DC0B).  The 64's Operating system does not make
                          use of these registers.
