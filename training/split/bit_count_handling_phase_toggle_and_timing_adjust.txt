# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Process bit-count bookkeeping after a detected pulse: read the bit count ($B4), save receiver bit count ($A8), update start-bit check flag ($A9) via INC/DEC depending on branch outcomes, compute a timing adjustment into $92 (subtract max $B1 and add constant $92), toggle the bit cycle phase ($A4), and store X into $D7 for later comparison.
