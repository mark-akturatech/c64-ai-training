# MACHINE - Demonstrates the .M memory display command (.M 1000 1010): explains format of lines showing base address and eight hex byte values, clarifies that the monitor prints hex values, and notes monitors typically show eight bytes per line and will fill the remainder of a line even when end address is earlier than line end.

Displaying Memory Contents
--------------------------

You'll notice that there is a command for displaying the contents of memory,
but there doesn't seem to be one for changing memory.  You can do both, of
course.

Suppose we ask to display memory from $1000 to $1010 with the command

  .M 1000 1010

Be careful that you have exactly one space before each address.  You might
get a display that looks something like this:

                                                                         :17:

  .:1000 11 3A E4 00 21 32 04 AA
  .:1008 20 4A 49 4D 20 42 55 54
  .:1010 54 45 52 46 49 45 4C 44

The four-digit number at the start of each line represents the address in
memory being displayed.  The two-digit numbers to the right represent the
contents of memory.  Keep in mind that all numbers used by the machine
language monitor are hexadecimal.

In the example above, $1000 contains a value of $11; $1001 contains a value
of $3A, and so on, until $1007, which contains a value of $AA.  We continue
with address $1008 on the next line.  Most monitors show eight memory
locations on each line, although some VIC-20 monitors show only five because
of the narrow screen.

We asked for memory locations up to address $1010 only; but we get the
contents of locations up to $1017 in this case.  The monitor always fills out
a line, even if you don't ask for the extra values.
