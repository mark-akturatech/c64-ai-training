# Kick Assembler - Explains importing .prg files as memory blocks using prgFiles parameter (e.g., .segmentdef Misc1 [prgFiles="data/Music.prg, data/Charset2x2.prg"]) or using .import c64 to place prg contents after an explicit *= address.

used values in the min-max range is set to the fill byte:
// This will generate $1000: 0,0,1,2,3,0,0,0
.segment Data [min=$1000, max=$1008, fill]
*=$1002
.byte 1,2,3

In the above example the fill byte is zero, but it can be specified with the 'fillByte' parameter.
Restricting size can be used to avoid using the ROM area or simply enforcing the rules of a maximum size
of 256 or 128 bytes.
The following entry was submitted to the 128 byte font competition on CSDb by Jesper Balman Gravgaard
(Rex). It rotates the ROM font 90 degrees. The max size of 128 bytes includes the two address bytes of the prg file.
// 90 degree rotated ROM font in 69 bytes of code
.segment Main [min=$0801, max=$0880-2, outPrg="out.prg"]
.label SCREEN = $400
.label CHARGEN = $d000
