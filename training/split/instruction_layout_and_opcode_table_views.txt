# 6502 Instruction Set - Details on instruction table layout and mapping bits to groups: explanation of a-b-c (aaabbbcc) mapping to opcode binary, examples (ROR row mapping), and several tabular views showing the opcode map grouped by c then a then b. Table highlights where operations and addressing modes are placed. Notes about empty columns when c=3 and layout exceptions where c=0,2 and b selects groups (branch, set flag).

          The overflow flag has no meaning in decimal mode.
          Multi-byte operations are just as in decimal mode: We first prepare the carry
          and then chain operations of the individual bytes in increasing value order,
          starting with the lowest value pair.
          (It may be important to note that Western Design Center (WDC) version of
          the processor, the 65C02, always clears the decimal flag when it enters an
          interrupt, while the original NMOS version of the 6502 does not.)
          6502 Jump Vectors and Stack Operations
          The 256 bytes processor stack of the 6502 is located at $0100 ... $01FF in
          memory, growing down from top to bottom.
          There are three 2-byte address locations at the very top end of the 64K address
          space serving as jump vectors for reset/startup and interrupt operations:
            $FFFA, $FFFB ... NMI (Non-Maskable Interrupt) vector
            $FFFC, $FFFD ... RES (Reset) vector
            $FFFE, $FFFF ... IRQ (Interrupt Request) vector
          As an interrupt occurs, any instruction currently processed is completed first.
          Only then, the value of the program counter (PC) is put in high-low order onto
          the stack, followed by the value currently in the status register, and control
          will be transferred to the address location found in the respective interrupt
          vector. The registers stored on the stack are recovered at the end of an
          interrupt routine, as control is transferred back to the interrupted code by
          the RTI instruction.

          Similarly, as a JSR instruction is encountered, PC is dumped onto the stack
          and recovered by the RTS instruction. (Here, the value stored is actually the
          address before the location, the program will eventually return to. Thus, the
          effective return address is PC+1.)
