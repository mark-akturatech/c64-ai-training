# MACHINE - Placing ML after end-of-BASIC and moving SOV upward creates a single unit (BASIC+ML) that saves/loads together. Caution: after marrying ML and BASIC, don't change BASIC (lines added/removed will relocate ML and break SYS addresses). Use LOAD/SAVE to preserve unit integrity.


After End-of-BASIC--Harmony
---------------------------

Suppose we place the machine language program behind the end-of-BASIC--that's
the three zeros in memory--and move up the SOV so that variables don't
disturb this program.  How will everything work now?

Things will work very well indeed.  This time, we need to load our BASIC
program first; the SOV will go immediately behind BASIC.  Then we may load
our machine language program, and the SOV moves right behind it.  The SOV is
in exactly the right place, assuming we load in the right order.  (If we
don't, the variables will destroy our machine language program.)

Once our two programs are together, and we say SAVE, the combination
program--BASIC and machine language together--will be saved.  A little
thought will reveal that memory from start-of-BASIC to just before start-of-
variables contains everything we need.  A subsequent load will bring
everything back in, and position SOV to exactly the right place.  We now have
a "unit" program--BASIC and machine language working together, loading and
saving as one program.

There's one small problem in this arrangement.  once we have married the
BASIC and machine language programs, we must not change the BASIC program.
If we added to or subtracted from this program, the machine language program
would move up or down--the relocation of memory goes right up to SOV.  The
program might not be able to work in the new place, and, of course, our SYS
commands would be wrong.
