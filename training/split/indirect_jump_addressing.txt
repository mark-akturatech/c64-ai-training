# Contents - Indirect addressing for JMP only: JMP (addr) reads a 16-bit address from the given operand location (which can be anywhere in memory, not restricted to zero page) and jumps to that address. X and Y are not used in address generation for indirect JMP.

Indirect Addressing 

There is only one instruction that uses indirect 
addressing in the 6510; it is an indirect jump. An 
indirect jump uses the principles of indirect address- 
ing that were discussed earlier. The main difference 
between the indirect jump and the other indirect in- 
structions is that a 2 byte value (16 bit) can be given 
as the address where the indirect data can be found. 
When using an indirect jump, the X and Y registers 
play no part in the address generation procedure.
