# COMMODORE 64 - Documentation of the KERNAL-managed receiver/transmitter buffer base pointers and zero-page temporaries used by the RS-232 system interface. Covers: the two-byte base pointers $00F7 (REBUF) and $00F9 (ROBUF), how OPEN sets them and CLOSE deallocates them (by zeroing the high-order bytes $00F8/$00FA), warning about manual allocation and top-of-memory pointer correctness. Also lists zero-page locations $00A7-$00B6 used locally by the RS-232 routines: INBIT, BITCI, RINONE, RIDATA, RIPRTY, BITTS, NXTBIT, RODATA and notes that these are internal temporaries for the system routines and not directly usable by BASIC/KERNAL-level programmers.

  ZERO-PAGE MEMORY LOCATIONS AND USAGE FOR
  RS-232 SYSTEM INTERFACE

    $00A7-INBIT-Receiver input bit temp storage.
    $00A8-BITCI-Receiver bit count in.
    $00A9-RINONE-Receiver flag Start bit check.
    $00AA-RIDATA-Receiver byte buffer/assembly location.
    $00AB-RIPRTY-Receiver parity bit storage.
    $00B4-BITTS-Transmitter bit count out.
    $00B5-NXTBIT-Transmitter next bit to be sent.
    $00B6-RODATA-Transmitter byte buffer/disassembly location.


    All the above zero-page locations are used locally and are only given
  as a guide to understand the associated routines. These cannot be used
  directly by the BASIC or KERNAL level programmer to do RS-232 type
  things. The system RS-232 routines must be used.
