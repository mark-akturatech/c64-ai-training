# COMMODORE 64 - NEXT [counter][,counter]...: ends a FOR...NEXT loop; may specify counters to end multiple nested loops (order: inner-most first). If omitted increments the current loop's counter. Loops can be nested to 9 levels. Explains incrementing by STEP and loop termination. Examples showing nested loops and use of omitted variable names.

  NEXT

  TYPE: Statement
  FORMAT: NEXT[<counter>][,<counter>]...

    Action: The NEXT statement is used with FOR to establish the end of a
  FOR...NEXT loop. The NEXT need not be physically the last statement
  in the loop, but it is always the last statement executed in a loop. The
  <counter> is the loop index's variable name used with FOR to start the
  loop. A single NEXT can stop several nested loops when it is followed by
  each FOR's <counter> variable name(s). To do this each name must appear
  in the order of inner-most nested loop first, to outer-most nested loop
  last. When using a single NEXT to increment and stop several variable
  names, each variable name must be separated by commas. Loops can be
  nested to 9 levels. If the counter variable(s) are omitted, the counter
  associated with the FOR of the current level (of the nested loops) is
  incremented.

    When the NEXT is reached, the counter value is incremented by 1 or by
  an optional STEP value. It is then tested against an end-value to see if
  it's time to stop the loop. A loop will be stopped when a NEXT is found
  which has its counter value greater than the end-value.

  EXAMPLES of NEXT Statement:

    10 FOR J=1 TO 5: FOR K=10 TO 20: FOR N=5 TO -5 STEP - 1

    20 NEXT N,K,J            (Stopping Nested Loops)



    10 FOR L=1 TO 100
    20 FOR M=1 TO 10
    30 NEXT M
    400 NEXT L               (Note how the loops do NOT cross each other)


    10 FOR A=1 TO 10
    20 FOR B=1 TO 20
    30 NEXT
    40 NEXT                  (Notice that no variable names are needed)
