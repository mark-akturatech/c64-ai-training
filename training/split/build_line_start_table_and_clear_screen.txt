# - Fully Commented Commodore 64 ROM Disassembly (English) - Constructs the start-of-line table for the 25 logical lines (marks line starts with high bit set), computes line pointers by adding the line length, writes an end-of-table marker, then loops to clear each screen line by calling the clear-screen-line routine 25 times.
