# COMMODORE 64 - Describes the ACPTR routine to read one byte from a device on the serial bus using full handshaking. Covers behavior (returns byte in A), preparatory calls required (TALK, TKSA if a secondary address is needed), error reporting via the status word (READST used to read status), a short usage sequence, and a short example showing JSR ACPTR and STA DATA.




    Description: This is the routine to use when you want to get informa-
  tion from a device on the serial bus, like a disk. This routine gets a
  byte of data off the serial bus using full handshaking. The data is
  returned in the accumulator. To prepare for this routine the TALK routine
  must be called first to command the device on the serial bus to send data
  through the bus. If the input device needs a secondary command, it must
  be sent by using the TKSA KERNAL routine before calling this routine.
  Errors are returned in the status word. The READST routine is used to
  read the status word.


  How to Use:

    0) Command a device on the serial bus to prepare to send data to
       the Commodore 64. (Use the TALK and TKSA KERNAL routines.)
    1) Call this routine (using JSR).
    2) Store or otherwise use the data.


  EXAMPLE:
