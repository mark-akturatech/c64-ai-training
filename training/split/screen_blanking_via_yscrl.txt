# Contents - Screen blanking: clear bit 4 of YSCRL to blank the entire screen to the border color; set bit 4 to turn screen on. Blanking doesn't alter screen memory and slightly speeds program because VIC fetches no display data while blanked.

BLANKING THE SCREEN 

The entire screen can be blanked to the border 
color by clearing bit 4 of the YSCRL register. The 
screen can be turned back on by setting bit 4 of the 
YSCRL register. Blanking the screen does not 
disrupt any data on the screen. When the screen is 
blanked, your program will run slightly faster 
because the VIC chip doesn't need to fetch any data 
from memory.
