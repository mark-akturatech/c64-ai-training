# A 256 Byte Autostart Fast Loader for the Commodore 64 - Hardware overview: Commodore 64 (6502 @ ~1 MHz, 64KB RAM), 1541 disk drive (separate 6502 @ ~1 MHz, 2KB RAM), and the IEC serial bus wiring (ATN, CLK, DATA from computer to drive; CLK, DATA return lines).


Hardware Context
----------------

The C64 features a 1 MHz 6502 CPU with 64 KB RAM, paired with a Commodore
1541 disk drive - itself a 1 MHz 6502 computer with 2 KB RAM. The IEC serial
bus connecting them uses three lines from computer to drive (ATN, CLK, DATA)
and two return lines (CLK, DATA).
