# byRiclianll - Introductory text and block header for the hex/ASCII dump of the first data block of the 'DIR' program (Track 16, Sector 01). Covers the human-readable lead-in "Let's look at the first block in this file." and the TRACK 16 - SECTOR 01 header, followed by the initial lines of the hex/ASCII dump (the beginning bytes and early token/ASCII fragments). This chunk provides context and the start of the block data.

Let's  look  at  the  first  block  in  this  file.
