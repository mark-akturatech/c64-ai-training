# 6502 Instruction Set - Beginning of detailed undocumented opcode descriptions: ALR (ASR) AND+LSR, ANC (AND + set C as ASL), ANC2 variant, ANE (XAA) unstable note and 'magic constant' behavior, ARR (AND + ROR) behavior with V and carry notes. Includes opcode bytes and immediate forms where applicable, and instability markers.

                      Decrements the operand and then compares the result to the
                      accumulator.
