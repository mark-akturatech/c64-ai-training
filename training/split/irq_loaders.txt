# An Introduction to Programming C-64 Demos - IRQ loaders: load data while the demo runs by performing drive I/O in main loop without disturbing interrupt routines; often include init routine (overwritable) and loader routine (kept); some support on-the-fly decrunching; loader compatibility varies by drive.

IRQ loaders
An IRQ loader is a loader that does the loading in the main loop, without disturbing your interrupt routines. So it can load while you're displaying scrollers, rasterbars and sprites on the screen, and the people who watch the demo won't even notice, unless they have noisy drives or pay attention to the drive LEDs. Of course, the more raster time that is available, the faster your files will be loaded.

Most IRQ loaders work the same way, but some of them don't work on all drives, and some of they are faster. Some also offer decrunching on the fly, which means you won't have to take care of decrunching yourself, after the file is loaded. Just load it and use the data right away.

You usually have an init routine, which just sets up the drive, and which can then be overwritten (to save memory), and then you have the loader routine, which you'll have to save until you've loaded the final part. There's usually some documentation, which will tell you the details of how to use it.
