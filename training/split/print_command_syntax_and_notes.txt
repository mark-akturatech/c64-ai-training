# byRiclianll - PRINT# usage to send commands to the disk: SYNTAX: PRINT# file#, "command". EXAMPLE: PRINT#15,"NO: MY DISKETTE, MD". Explains the 'NO:' (NEW) command, parameters (disk name up to 16 chars, comma, two-character disk ID written to each sector), and the important syntax detail — PRINT# (no space before '#') and don't use ?# abbreviation.

2.  Sending  commands  to  the  DOS  using  a  PRINT#  statement. 

In  order  to  send  commands  from  your  computer  to  the  1541,  you  use  a  PRINT#  state- 
ment. A  PRINT#  statement  is  a  BASIC  command  which  looks  like  this: 


SYNTAX:      PRINT#  file#,  "command" 
EXAMPLE:    PRINT#15,    "NO: MY  DISKETTE, MD" 


17 


where 


file#  =  the  logical  file  number  you  used  when  you  opened  the  command  channel 
command  =  the  disk  command  to  be  sent  to  the  DOS 

NOTE:  The  statement  is  PRINT#  not  PRINT  #.  You  must  not  put  a  space  before  the 
#  sign.  Spaces  following  the  #  sign  are  always  optional.  DO  NOT  use  ?#  as  an  abbrevia- 
tion either.  The  correct  abbreviation  is  pR(p  then  SHIFTED  R). 

In  this  example,  the  disk  command  is  "NO:MY  DISKETTE,MD".  This  command  causes 
the  DOS  to  prepare  the  blank  diskette  in  the  drive  for  first-time  use. 

Although  there  are  many  different  disk  commands,  they  fall  into  two  groups: 

1.  Commands  related  to  disk  housekeeping. 

2.  Commands  to  read  or  write  data  to  a  diskette  or  the  disk  drive's  RAM. 

The  disk  housekeeping  commands  are  discussed  in  the  next  part  of  this  chapter.  The 
commands  relating  to  reading  or  writing  data  are  discussed  in  Chapter  5  on  Direct- Access 
Programming.
