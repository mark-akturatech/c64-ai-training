# COMMODORE 64 - Explains LINE 55 computations used inside the movement loop. RX = INT(X/256) produces 0 for X<256 and 1 for X≥256; RX is used to POKE V+16 with 0 or 1 to indicate the right side of the screen. LX = X - RX*256 computes the low 8 bits (0–255) used for the VIC X-position register, resetting to 0 when crossing from the left to the right side so POKE V+16,1 can be used properly.

  LINE 55:

    RX=INT(X/256)       RX is the integer of X/256 which means that RX is
                        rounded off to 0 when X is less than 256, and RX
                        becomes 1 when X reaches position 256. We will
                        use RX in a moment to POKE V+16 with a 0 or 1
                        to turn on the "RIGHT SIDE" of the screen.

    LX=X-RX*256         When the sprite is at X position 0, the formula
                        looks like this: LX = 0 - (0 times 256) or 0. When
                        the sprite is at X position 1 the formula looks
                        like this: LX = 1 - (0 times 256) or 1. When the
                        sprite is at X position 256 the formula looks like
                        this: LX = 256 - (1 times 256) or 0 which resets X
                        back to 0 which must be done when you start over on
                        the RIGHT SIDE of the screen (POKEV+16,1).
