# Analyzing C64 tape loaders - Introduction to a 'non-IRQ based' turbo loader walkthrough (CHR Loader T1-T3 example). States prerequisite knowledge: CIA timers and Commodore 64 Programmer's Reference. Mentions that some CIA extracts are included in appendices.

===== Non-IRQ Loader =====



==== Introduction ====

We document here a "nonIRQ based" loader step-by-step. Before starting with this reading it's necessary to have a good knowledge of CIA Timers. I reported in Appendix A and B an extract (I did some changes where needed) from MAPC6410.TXT (the Project 64 etext of the //"Mapping The Commodore 64 book"//). Those paragraphs just cover the CIAs use we are interested in.\\
In addition to CIA Timers, you should have a copy of the //"Commodore 64 Programmer's Reference Guide"//, to consult it while studying the ASM code.
