# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $D017 (53271) YXPAND — Sprite Vertical Expansion Register: bits 0-7 control vertical expansion for sprites 0-7 (1=double height, 0=normal). When set, each sprite row becomes two scanlines tall.

$D017        YXPAND       Sprite Vertical Expansion Register

                     0    Expand Sprite 0 vertically (1=double height, 0=normal height)
                     1    Expand Sprite 1 vertically (1=double height, 0=normal height)
                     2    Expand Sprite 2 vertically (1=double height, 0=normal height)
                     3    Expand Sprite 3 vertically (1=double height, 0=normal height)
                     4    Expand Sprite 4 vertically (1=double height, 0=normal height)
                     5    Expand Sprite 5 vertically (1=double height, 0=normal height)
                     6    Expand Sprite 6 vertically (1=double height, 0=normal height)
                     7    Expand Sprite 7 vertically (1=double height, 0=normal height)

                          This register can be used to double the height of any sprite.  When
                          the bit in this register that corresponds to a particular sprite is
                          set to 1, each dot of the 24 by 21 sprite dot matrix will become two
                          raster scan lines high instead of one.
