# COMMODORE 64 - Details secondary-address meanings: for cassette, secondary=1 opens for writing; secondary=2 writes an end-of-tape marker on close (prevents reading past data and getting ?DEVICE NOT PRESENT). For disk files, secondary addresses 2–14 are available for data files and other numbers have special meanings in DOS commands. States that a secondary address must be used for disk drives and refers to the disk drive manual for DOS command details.

    A secondary address value of one (1) OPENs cassette tape files for
  writing. A secondary address value of two (2) causes an end-of-tape
  marker to be written when the file is later closed. The end-of-tape
  marker prevents accidentally reading past the end of data which results
  in the BASIC error message ?DEVICE NOT PRESENT.
    For disk files, the secondary addresses 2 thru 14 are available for
  data-files, but other numbers have special meanings in DOS commands.
  You must use a secondary address when using your disk drive(s). (See
  your disk drive manual for DOS command details.)
