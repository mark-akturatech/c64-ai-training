# COMMODORE 64 - KERNAL RDTIM (call $FFDE / 65502): Read system clock (jiffies, 1/60s resolution). Returns three bytes: A = MSB, X = middle byte, Y = LSB (least significant). Stack requirement: 2. Example shows storing TIME in memory via STY/ STX/ STA of returned values.


  B-21. Function Name: RDTIM

    Purpose: Read system clock
    Call address: $FFDE (hex) 65502 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A, X, Y
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns: None
    Stack requirements: 2
    Registers affected: A, X, Y

    Description: This routine is used to read the system clock. The clock's
  resolution is a 60th of a second. Three bytes are returned by the
  routine. The accumulator contains the most significant byte, the X index
  register contains the next most significant byte, and the Y index
  register contains the least significant byte.

  EXAMPLE:

    JSR RDTIM
    STY TIME
    STX TIME+1
    STA TIME+2
    ...
    TIME *=*+3
