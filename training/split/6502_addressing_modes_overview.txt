# Kick Assembler - Lists the traditional 6502/C64 addressing modes with examples. Covers: no-argument (nop), immediate (lda #$30), zeropage (lda $30), zeropage,X (lda $30,x), zeropage,Y (ldx $30,y), indirect zeropage,X (lda ($30,x)), indirect zeropage,Y (lda ($30),y), absolute (lda $1000), absolute,X/Y (lda $1000,x / lda $1000,y), indirect (jmp ($1000)), relative (bne loop), and 65C02-specific modes such as indirect zeropage (adc ($12)), zeropage-relative (bbr1 $12,label) and indirect with absolute+X (jmp ($1234,x)). Includes short formatting artifacts from the original page.

3.2. Argument Types
Kick Assembler uses the traditional notation for addressing modes / argument types:

Additional information can be found by searching:
- "zeropage_conversion_and_explicit_mode_forcing" which expands on automatic zeropage conversion and suffixes to force addressing forms
- "deprecated_mnemonic_extensions" which expands on deprecated mnemonic suffixes that also force addressing modes (kept for backward compatibility)
