# ********* - INSRT ($D8) — Insert mode flag. Describes behavior when INST key is pressed: shifting the line right, allocating another physical line if needed and available, updating LNMX ($D5) and the screen line link table, and tracking how many insert spaces are open (any nonzero value is interpreted as the number of inserts). Explains how insert mode makes the editor act like quote mode until inserts are filled, with the difference that DELETE leaves a printed equivalent while INST inserts spaces normally.

Flag: Insert Mode (Any Number Greater Than 0 Is the Number of Inserts)

When the INST key is pressed, the screen editor shifts the line to the
right, allocates another physical line to the logical line if
necessary (and possible), updates the screen line length in 213 ($D5),
and adjusts the screen line link table at 217 ($D9).  This location is
used to keep track of the number of spaces that has been opened up in
this way.

Until the spaces that have been opened up are filled, the editor acts
as if in quote mode (see location 212 ($D4), the quote mode flag).
This means that cursor control characters that are normally
nonprinting will leave a printed equivalent on the screen when
entered, instead of having their normal effect on cursor movement,
etc.  The only difference between insert and quote mode is that the
DELETE key will leave a printed equivalent in insert mode, while the
INST key will insert spaces as normal.
