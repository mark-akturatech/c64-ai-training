# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - $D402-$D403 — Voice 1 Pulse Width Control: 12-bit pulse width (low byte + lower nybble of high register) controls duty cycle; formula PULSE WIDTH = (REGISTER VALUE / 40.95)%; range 0-4095. Changing pulse width alters timbre of pulse waveform.

$D402-$D403               Voice 1 Pulse Waveform Width Control

                          As you will see below under the description of the Control Register at
                          54276 ($D404), you can select one of four different waveforms for the
                          output of each voice.  If the pulse waveform is selected, these
                          registers must be set to establish the pulse width.

                          The pulse width has a 12-bit resolution, being made up of the value in
                          the first register and the value in the lower nybble of the second
                          register.  The pulse width determines the duty cycle, or proportion of
                          the time that the rectangular wave will stay at the high part of the
                          cycle.

                          The following formula shows the relationship between the value in the
                          Pulse Width Register and the proportion of time that the wave stays at
                          the high part of the cycle:

                          PULSE WIDTH=(REGISTER VALUE/40.95)%

                          The possible range of the register values (0-4095) covers the range of
                          the duty cycles from 0 to 100 percent in 4096 steps.  Changing the
                          pulse width will vastly change the sound created with the pulse
                          waveform.
