# - C64 I/O Map (Mapping The Commodore 64) - CIA #2 overview ($DD00-$DD0F): CIA #2 is identical in registers to CIA #1 but used for Serial Bus, RS-232, and User Port control; Data Port A selects VIC-II 16K bank via bits 0-1. Key difference: CIA #1 IRQ is wired to 6510 IRQ while CIA #2 interrupts go to NMI line (cannot be masked by SEI); disable via CIA mask register and use NMI vector for CIA#2-driven routines.

$DD00-$DD0F               Complex Interface Adapter (CIA) #2 Registers

                          Locations 56576-56591 ($DD00-$DD0F) are used to address the Complex
                          Interface Adapter chip #2 (CIA #2).  Since the chip itself is
                          identical to CIA #1, which is addressed at 56320 ($DC00), the
                          discussion here will be limited to the use which the 64 makes of this
                          particular chip.  For more general information on the chip registers,
                          please see the corresponding entries for CIA #1.

                          One of the significant differences between CIA chips #1 and #1 is the
                          use to which Data Ports A and B are put.  The peripheral input and
                          output devices that CIA #2 controls are those on the Serial Bus (such
                          as the 1541 Disk Drive and 1525 printer), the RS-232 device (which is
                          used for telecommunications), and the User Port, an eight-bit parallel
                          port that can be turned to whatever purpose the user desires.  In
                          addition, Data Port A has the important task of selecting the 16K bank
                          of memory that will be used by the VIC-II chip for graphics.

                          Another significant difference between CIA chips #1 and #2 is that the
                          interrupt line of CIA #1 is wired to the 6510 IRQ line, while that of
                          CIA #2 is wired to the NMI line.  This means that interrupts from this
                          chip cannot be masked by setting the Interrupt disable flag (SEI).
                          They can be disabled from CIA's Mask Register, though.  Be sure to use
                          the NMI vector when setting up routines to be driven by interrupts
                          generated by this chip.
