# C64 PETSCII and Screen Codes Reference - sta.c64.org - Important notes about PETSCII behavior and special cases: control code ranges ($00-$1F and $80-$9F) are layout/control codes, codes $60-$7F and $E0-$FE are copies of other codes ($C0-$DF and $A0-$BE), and code $FF is a BASIC token for the pi symbol with special internal conversions to/from $DE. Explains keyboard buffer behaviour for $DE.

NOTES:
  - Codes $00-$1F and $80-$9F are control codes. Printing them will cause
    a change in screen layout or behavior, not an actual character displayed.
  - Codes $60-$7F and $E0-$FE are not used. Although you can print them,
    these are, actually, copies of codes $C0-$DF and $A0-$BE.
  - Code $FF is the BASIC token of the pi symbol. It is converted internally
    to code $DE when printed and, vice versa, code $DE is converted to $FF
    when fetched from the screen. However, when reading the keyboard buffer,
    you will find code $DE for Shift-up arrow as no conversion takes place
    there yet.
