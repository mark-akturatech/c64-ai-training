# ca65 Users Guide - The -D option: define symbols on the command line. Without a value the symbol gets value zero. When supplying a value, $ can be used as a hex prefix (may require quoting on some shells).

-D
This option allows you to define symbols on the command line. Without a value, the symbol is defined with the value zero. When giving a value, you may use the '$' prefix for hexadecimal symbols. Please note that for some operating systems, '$' has a special meaning, so you may have to quote the expression.
