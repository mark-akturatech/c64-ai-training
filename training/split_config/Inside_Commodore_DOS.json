      "description": "Chapter 8 introduction and practical recovery procedures: stresses backups and introduces tools for recovery. Explains unscratching a file (what changes when scratching occurs: file-type byte set to $00 and sectors freed in BAM), step-by-step recovery using 'VIRTUAL DIRECTORY' and 'EDIT TRACK & SECTOR' (locate half-sector containing directory entry on track 18, edit file-type byte back to correct file type, rewrite sector, and VALIDATE disk with OPEN 15,8,15,\"V0\":CLOSE15). Provides group-to-sector mapping for directory groups to sectors on track 18 and lists file-type hex values for PRG/SEQ/REL/USR/DEL. Begins discussion of soft vs hard read/write errors and points to appendix utilities (RECOVER TRACK & SECTOR, LAZARUS) to attempt sector recovery. Also introduces steps for hard error recovery and relative-file recovery summaries and finally advises running 1541 BACKUP to rescue an entire non-initializable diskette.",
